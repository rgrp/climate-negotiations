abstract: "The ninth Conference of the Parties (COP-9) to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the nineteenth  sessions of the COP's Subsidiary Body for Scientific and  Technological Advice (SBSTA) and Subsidiary Body for  Implementation (SBI) were held at the Fiera Milan Congress Center  in Milan, Italy, from 1-12 December 2003. Over 5000 participants  from 166 governments, four observer States, 312 intergovernmental,  non-governmental and other observer organizations, and 191 media  outlets were in attendance. Throughout the meeting, Parties  convened in several contact groups and informal consultations, as  well as in plenary sessions of the SBSTA, SBI and COP. At COP-9,  Parties adopted numerous decisions and conclusions on various  issues, including: definitions and modalities for including  afforestation and reforestation activities under the Clean  Development Mechanism; good practice guidance on land use,  land-use change and forestry (LULUCF); the Special Climate Change  Fund (SCCF); and the Least Developed Countries (LDC) Fund. Three  ministerial high-level round-table discussions were held on  Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11 December."

The two faces of the UNFCCC, the negotiators and the constituency  faces, were clearly visible at COP-9. The official negotiations,  while remaining deadlocked on several issues, reached consensus on  some decisions, particularly concerning sinks in the CDM for which  the COP will be remembered as the 'forest COP.' Running parallel  to the contact groups and informal consultations, where fine  details were being discussed, COP-9 proved that climate change  issues remain high on the political agendas of many NGOs, business  groups, and the academic community. It is these constituencies who  continue to prove that, regardless of lack of significant progress,  vigorous efforts to address the adverse effects of climate change  are already underway, and are gaining momentum.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  sustainable development, with negative impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and a majority of  scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is  necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a framework  for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of  greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic  interference' with the climate system. Controlled gases include  methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon dioxide. The  UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, it now has 188 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, and charged it with reaching agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  to achieve quantified emission reduction targets. These countries,  known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their  overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least 5% below  1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period),  with specific targets varying from country to country. The  Protocol also established three mechanisms to assist Annex I  Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively: an  emissions trading system; joint implementation (JI) of  emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and a Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM) that encourages projects in  non-Annex I (developing country) Parties.

At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how countries will cut emissions  and measure and assess emissions reductions. To enter into force,  the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, and by  Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total carbon  dioxide emissions for 1990. To date, 120 Parties have ratified the  Protocol, including 32 Annex I Parties, representing 44.2% of the  emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

In November 1998, Parties met at  COP-4 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and agreed to a set of decisions  known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The BAPA set  COP-6 as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational  details of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the  UNFCCC. Issues to be addressed included rules relating to the  mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting  methods for national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules  on crediting countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC  requiring resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change and/or to actions taken by  industrialized countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed SB-13 were held in The Hague,  the Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000. During the second week  of negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk (the Netherlands)  attempted to facilitate negotiations on the many disputed  political and technical issues by convening high-level informal  Plenary sessions. After almost 36 hours of intense talks in the  final two days of COP-6, negotiators could not agree on a range of  topics, particularly financial issues, supplementarity in the use  of the mechanisms, compliance, and LULUCF. On Saturday afternoon,  25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates had failed  to reach agreement. Delegates then agreed to suspend COP-6 and  resume negotiations in 2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  agreement reached in Kyoto, stating that it considered the  Protocol to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy  and exempt key developing countries from emissions reduction  targets. Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II and SB-14 from 16-27  July 2001, in Bonn, Germany. After protracted consultations,  President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft political  decision. Despite support from several Parties, disagreements  surfaced over the nature of the compliance regime. After several  days of high-level consultations, ministers agreed to adopt  President Pronk's political decision, with a revised section on  compliance on 25 July 2001. The political decision - or 'Bonn  Agreements' - needed to be operationalized through COP decisions.  These decisions were considered a 'package,' and since no  agreement was reached on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF,  all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates continued discussions on the 'Bonn Agreements' at  COP-7 and SB-15 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10  November 2001. After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on  LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues),  7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of information),  and input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD)  was proposed. Although the deal was accepted by most regional  groups, some Annex I Parties, including Australia, Canada, Japan,  New Zealand, and the Russian Federation, did not join the consensus,  disputing, among other things, eligibility requirements and credit  banking under the mechanisms. However, following extensive  negotiations, the 'Marrakesh Accords' were agreed.

### SB-16

Parties met at SB-16 in Bonn from 5-14 June 2002. Delegates  considered several issues previously left off the agenda due to  the pressing BAPA negotiations. Views on the direction of the  climate process differed, with some Parties looking back to recent  debates and others looking ahead toward the second commitment  period. Many hoped the Protocol could enter into force by the WSSD  in August 2002, with the EU and Japan announcing their Protocol  ratifications prior to the Summit.

### COP-8

Delegates to COP-8 and SB-17 met from 23 October to 1  November 2002, in New Delhi, India. On the final day of COP-8,  they adopted the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and  Sustainable Development. The Declaration reaffirms development and  poverty eradication as overriding priorities in developing  counties, and recognizes Parties' common but differentiated  responsibilities and national development priorities and  circumstances in the implementation of UNFCCC commitments. Parties  at COP-8 considered institutional and procedural issues under the  Protocol and adopted several decisions, including the Rules of  Procedure of the Executive Board of the CDM.

### SB-18

Delegates to SB-18 met in Bonn from 4-13 June 2003, and  continued to address issues under negotiation since COP-8 and  prepare for the Protocol's entry into force. Conclusions were  agreed on a number of issues, but the issue of the Secretariat's  programme budget for 2004-5 and the Special Climate Change Fund  proved to be particularly difficult.

# COP-9 REPORT

Opening the session on Monday morning, 1 December, COP-8  Vice-President Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu) welcomed participants.

On behalf of COP-8 President T.R. Baalu, India's Joint Secretary  for Environment and Forests C. Viswanath called on Annex I Parties  to take the lead in addressing the impacts of climate change and  to provide developing countries with financial and technological  assistance. He rejected the introduction of commitments for  developing countries.

Vice-President Sopoaga then introduced Miklós Persányi, Minister  of Environment and Water, Hungary, who was elected as COP-9  President by acclamation. In his opening statement, President  Persányi highlighted efforts in developing countries to implement  climate-friendly production patterns. He stressed that although  the Protocol has not yet entered into force, its ratification by  numerous Parties demonstrates its importance.

Altero Matteoli, Italy's Minister for the Environment and  Territory, said COP-9 provided an opportunity to identify new and  stronger initiatives for combating climate change. Roberto  Formigoni, President of the Region of Lombardy, stressed the  importance of regional action on climate change, while Gabriel  Albertini, Mayor of Milan, said delegates must take long-term  views of climate change, its impacts, and the well-being of future  generations. Luigi Cocchiaro, for the President of the Province of  Milan, called for increased implementation in the areas of  transport and renewable energy.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter said that, while the  date of the Protocol's entry into force remained uncertain, it was  encouraging that this had not slowed the momentum for action. She  emphasized the need to ensure that adequate resources were  provided to meet programme delivery and implementation of COP  decisions.

Morocco, speaking for the G-77/China, called on the Russian  Federation to ratify the Protocol and on the US to 'come back on  board,' and expressed concern about the low level of Parties'  contributions to the Secretariat. Zimbabwe, on behalf of the  Africa Group, said Annex I Parties have failed to assume  leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and lack  political will to do so.

Italy, speaking for the EU, urged the US to take actions  comparable to those that would have been expected from them under  the Protocol. Tuvalu, for the Alliance of Small Island States  (AOSIS), said the discussion on sinks in the CDM must maintain the  social, environmental and economic integrity of the mechanism.  Pakistan said work at COP-9 must focus on capacity building,  technology transfer, and the Special Climate Change Fund.

Highlighting the vulnerability of LDCs, Tanzania, for the LDCs,  stressed the need for entry into force of the Protocol and  constructive work on matters relating to technology transfer,  capacity building and LDCs.

The COP met in plenary sessions on Monday, 1 December, Thursday,  4 December and twice on Friday, 12 December. A high-level segment  took place on Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11 December, and included  three round-table discussions. The SBI and SBSTA opened on Monday,  1 December. The SBSTA met from Monday to Wednesday, 1-3 December,  and closed on Tuesday, 9 December. The SBI met from Monday to  Thursday, 1-4 December, Tuesday, 9 December, and closed on  Wednesday, 10 December. Numerous contact group meetings and  informal consultations were also held. This report summarizes the  issues discussed at this meeting, organized in accordance with the  agendas of the SBSTA, SBI and COP.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

SBSTA was chaired by Halldór Thorgeirsson (Iceland) and convened  in four plenary meetings between Monday, 1 December and Tuesday, 9  December.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Adoption of the agenda: Delegates adopted  the SBSTA's agenda on Monday, 1 December (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/11).

###     Election of officers other than the Chair

SBSTA elected Arthur  Rolle (Bahamas) as Vice-Chair of SBSTA, and Ibrahim Bin Ahmed  Al-Ajami (Oman) as SBSTA Rapporteur on Tuesday, 9 December.

### IPCC THIRD ASSESSMENT REPORT

Scientific, technical and  socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and  adaptation to, climate change, and scientific, technical and  socioeconomic aspects of mitigation: On Monday, 1 December, Chair  Thorgeirsson introduced his summary of the pre-sessional  consultations, held from 27-28 November 2003, in Milan. Malaysia,  speaking for the G-77/China, expressed hope that the new agenda  items would not introduce new commitments for developing country  Parties.

The EU said SBSTA should use a wide range of approaches and  methodologies, including case-studies, technical papers, and  workshops, and should draw on activities being developed by  stakeholders. Japan said the process should be based on a  step-wise, practical approach.

Delegates agreed to convene a contact group chaired by SBSTA Chair  Thorgeirsson on this issue.

On Thursday, 4 December, contact group Chair Thorgeirsson  introduced the draft decision and draft SBSTA conclusions on this  issue. Noting the need to further discuss the themes and issues to  be considered by SBSTA under the two new agenda items, the  G-77/China objected to forwarding a draft decision to the COP.  Opposing the G-77/China, several Parties emphasized the need to  begin work on the new agenda items. Chair Thorgeirsson said he  would consult informally with Parties.

In the contact group meeting held on Friday, 5 December, Chair  Thorgeirsson reported on informal consultations, noting that  Parties highlighted the need to: build upon existing agreement;  advance work without creating boundaries; encourage broad  participation, including from experts, while keeping the process  under Party control; and ensure participation by all Parties.  Parties considered a future workshop, with Saudi Arabia urging  work to focus on determining the terms of reference of the  workshop. The G-77/China, New Zealand and Thailand stressed the  need to determine the workshop's scope. China, India, Sudan, and  Saudi Arabia proposed structured submissions on priority themes  for consideration at the workshop, while the EU and Norway said  there was no need for further submissions. The G-77/China, Saudi  Arabia and Oman objected to drafting a COP decision, while the EU,  Norway, New Zealand, the Russian Federation and Canada expressed  support for it.

In the contact group on Saturday, 6 December, Chair Thorgeirsson  introduced a revised draft COP decision and draft conclusions, and  invited Parties to meet in informal consultations.

Following agreement in the informal consultations, Parties met in  the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December. The Russian Federation  emphasized that the TAR provides a 'scientific basis of a global  nature' applicable to all Parties. SBSTA adopted conclusions and  agreed to forward a draft decision to the COP. The COP adopted the  decision on Friday, 12 December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.26),  SBSTA notes that exchanges with experts as held during the  pre-sessional consultations may be useful for the future work of  SBSTA under the new agenda items. SBSTA also notes that the themes  of, inter alia, sustainable development, opportunities and solutions,  and vulnerability and risk, are relevant for consideration under  the two new agenda items. SBSTA invites Parties to submit their  views on these themes, and other information relating to these  agenda items.

In the conclusions, SBSTA also: requests the Secretariat, under  the guidance of the SBSTA Chair, to organize a workshop on each of  the new agenda items during SBSTA-20; requests the SBSTA Chair to  take into account the views and information provided by Parties  when organizing the workshops; and agrees to determine next steps  on each of the new agenda items at SBSTA-20 in light of the  outcomes of the workshops.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.26/Add.1), the  COP requests SBSTA-20 to initiate its work on scientific,  technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, and on scientific,  technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, and to focus on  exchanging information and sharing experiences and view among  Parties on practical opportunities and solutions to facilitate the  UNFCCC's implementation. The COP also requests SBSTA to report on  its work to COP-11.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Review of methodological work under the  UNFCCC and Protocol: In the SBSTA Plenary on Monday, 1 December,  several Parties noted the value of the Secretariat's synthesis of  views on a future work programme on methodological work and  stressed the need for a data interface. Chair Thorgeirsson  requested Jim Penman (UK) and Brian Challenger (Antigua and  Barbuda) to co-chair a contact group to discuss these issues.

In the contact group on Tuesday, 2 December, Parties disagreed  over the approach and content of the activities to be discussed,  but agreed to rationalize the proposals, avoid the duplication of  work, and move forward with the commencement of a scoping phase  for a data interface.

In the contact group meeting held on Thursday, 4 December, the  Co-Chairs presented proposed elements for further discussion,  distinguishing new items from those that are already being  addressed under the UNFCCC or elsewhere. Several Parties  recommended a focus on methodological work for UNFCCC  implementation and good practices in policies and measures (P&Ms)  in Annex I Parties. Parties disagreed over the inclusion of text  on cleaner or less-greenhouse gas-emitting energy, methodologies  on the impact of implementation of the Protocol, and methodologies  to determine Parties' contributions.

On Friday, 5 December, concerns were raised in the contact group  regarding: cost implications; whether work on the agenda item had  been completed; linking text on capacity building and  collaborative efforts to the elements of methodological work; and  text on periodic overviews.

In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, some delegates  expressed concern that provisions on background information and on  future methodological work should await completion of IPCC TAR  discussions. Parties agreed to provisions on a data-interface  scoping phase and to delete text on: periodic overviews of the  status of methodological work; collaboration with relevant  organizations; and capacity building relating to the development  and dissemination of methodologies. Parties debated whether to  remove provisions on the exchange of information regarding the  implementation of national systems for the preparation of national  greenhouse gas inventories, and on the exchange of information to  increase common understanding of proposals for determining  Parties' contributions to controlling emissions.

In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, delegates disagreed  over whether a proposed workshop should focus solely on fourth  national communications, on Annex I Parties' projections, or  whether it should be more general. Agreeing to focus a workshop on  emissions projections of Annex I Parties as a contribution to  their fourth national communications, SBSTA adopted the  conclusions.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.25),  SBSTA recognizes that the Secretariat's Greenhouse Gas Information  System is the authoritative repository of greenhouse gas data  reported by Parties to the UNFCCC. It requests the Secretariat,  subject to the availability of funding, to: initiate a scoping  phase for consideration of a data interface and invite Parties to  submit views on this to be synthesized by the Secretariat; invite  Parties' submissions and organize a workshop on emissions  projections of Annex I Parties, as a contribution to their fourth  national communications; and invite Party submissions and organize  a workshop on national systems under Protocol Article 5.1 for the  preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories.

###     Greenhouse gas inventories

In the SBSTA Plenary on Monday, 1  December, Parties called for the identification of options to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation. They also  proposed that SBSTA work with the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) to achieve further progress, urged a more  proactive role than information gathering on emissions from  aviation and maritime transportation, and encouraged SBSTA to  support programmes for improving maritime and aviation emissions  estimates.

Chair Thorgeirsson requested Helen Plume (New Zealand) to conduct  informal consultations on the matter. In the SBSTA Plenary on  Tuesday, 9 December, Plume said Parties had been unable to remove  all of the brackets from the draft conclusions on emissions from  fuel used for international aviation and maritime transportation.  Following discussions in Plenary, Parties agreed to remove the  brackets. SBSTA adopted the conclusions, as amended.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.28),  SBSTA addresses methodological issues, emissions from fuel used  for international aviation and maritime transportation, and the  report on national greenhouse gas inventory data from Annex I  Parties for the period of 1990-2001. SBSTA requests the  Secretariat to continue to cooperate with the IPCC and provide  more detailed information, based on the latest available  greenhouse gas inventories submitted by Parties, and the result of  the technical review of the greenhouse gas inventories. SBSTA also  notes the substantial improvement in quality and timing of  greenhouse gas inventory submissions, by most Annex I Parties.

###     Afforestation and Reforestation under the CDM

On Tuesday, 2  December, SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson noted progress on definitions  and modalities on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)  projects under the CDM during pre-sessional consultations  undertaken Friday and Saturday, 29-30 November. He said delegates  had addressed, inter alia: baselines, additionality and leakage;  crediting options; and socioeconomic and environmental criteria.  Chair Thorgeirsson said a contact group would be formed,  co-chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany) and Thelma Krug (Brazil).

In a meeting of the contact group held on Wednesday, 3 December,  Co-Chair Sach presented a revised negotiating text, to be annexed  to the draft COP decision. The text incorporated several  submissions by Parties, particularly on permanence and on  socioeconomic and environmental criteria. Other proposals tabled  included provisions on invasive alien species (IAS), genetically  modified organisms (GMOs), and small-scale projects.

On Thursday, 5 December, delegates met in informal consultations  and discussed the viability of positive leakage and the various  options for establishing a crediting period.

In the contact group on Saturday, 6 December, Co-Chair Krug  presented a revised annex to the draft COP decision. Detailing the  modalities and procedures of afforestation and reforestation  project activities, the annex maintains agreed definitions of  forest, afforestation and reforestation. It also includes an  option for both temporary and long-term credits, which may be  renewed or taken for a fixed crediting period; allows for negative  leakage only; provides a definition for small-scale projects with  modalities to be decided at COP-10; incorporates socioeconomic and  environmental criteria into project design document requirements;  and includes a general reference to the IPCC Good Practice  Guidance.

On Monday, 8 December, informal consultations continued throughout  the day and into the night. Discussions centered, inter alia, on  the size and modalities governing small-scale projects, and the  inclusion of IAS and GMOs.

On Tuesday, 9 December, Co-Chair Krug presented the contact group  with a revised annex to the draft COP decision resulting from  informal consultations held throughout Monday, 8 December, and  into Tuesday morning, 9 December. Several Parties congratulated  the Co-Chairs on the 'balanced package' and urged others to avoid  re-opening the debate. Canada, opposed by Switzerland and the EU,  proposed deleting reference in the draft COP decision on awareness  of international 'environmental' agreements and leaving only  'international agreements.' The amendment was accepted in the  spirit of compromise, and the contact group decided to forward the  draft COP decision to SBSTA for approval.

In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, contact group  Co-Chair Krug reported that agreement had been reached on the draft  COP decision. While Australia expressed concern regarding the  singling out of GMOs and IAS, Norway regretted the lack of  stronger language excluding them from project activities. The EU  stressed that the text was balanced and reflected progress toward  implementing the Protocol. On Tuesday, 9 December, SBSTA agreed to  forward the draft decision to the COP. On Friday, 12 December, the  COP adopted the decision.

###     COP Decision

The decision on afforestation and reforestation  under the CDM (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27) contains a draft COP/MOP  decision and an annex detailing the modalities and procedures of  the project activities decision. In the decision, the COP declares  an awareness of relevant provisions in international agreements  applying to afforestation and reforestation under the CDM, and  recognizes that host Parties evaluate risks associated with GMOs  and IAS according to their national laws. The COP also invites  Parties' submissions on simplified modalities and procedures for  small-scale projects and their implementation, and requests the  Secretariat to prepare a technical paper on the matter based on  Parties' submissions, to be considered by SBSTA-20 and COP-10.

###     Good practice guidance and other information on LULUCF

SBSTA  decided to address the IPCC report on good practice guidance for  LULUCF, together with the IPCC's work on factoring out direct  human-induced changes in carbon stocks from indirect human-induced  and natural effects, as well as with the IPCC report on  degradation of forests and devegetation of other vegetation types.

On Tuesday, 2 December, the IPCC presented its report on Good  Practice Guidance (GPG) for LULUCF to SBSTA. The IPCC also  reported on its work on factoring out, and noted difficulties in  providing a practical methodology for factoring out for a broad  range of LULUCF activities. Chair Thorgeirsson said Margaret  Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) and Audun Rosland (Norway) would  co-chair a contact group to develop conclusions on the GPG.

On Wednesday, 3 December, during a meeting of the contact group,  several Parties suggested adopting the IPCC's GPG. They noted the  need to retain links in the common reporting format with the  Revised 1996 IPCC Reporting Guidelines, and said that the sectoral  tables should be simplified and consistent. Co-Chair Rosland  established a small group to continue informal discussions on this  issue.

The G-77/China and the EU highlighted the importance of factoring  out, saying it reflected principles agreed in the Marrakesh  Accords, and therefore needed to be addressed before the second  commitment period. On degradation of forests and devegetation of  other types, the contact group agreed that submissions by Parties  should be requested for further discussion at COP-10.

In the contact group on Thursday, 4 December, Co-Chair Rosland  reported progress on the common reporting format and announced  that the EU, with the help of Canada, would present reporting  tables on sectoral background data for LULUCF based on IPCC GPG.

On Friday, 5 December, the contact group discussed draft  conclusions recommending the use of the IPCC GPG under the UNFCCC,  while considering the GPG further at SBSTA-20, before recommending  its use under the Protocol. AOSIS raised concerns over adopting  the GPG without sufficient time for its examination, and also over  the practicality of considering the GPG for the UNFCCC and  Protocol separately. Others urged the adoption of the GPG for both  the UNFCCC and the Protocol in order to prepare national  inventories in time for entry into force of the Protocol. The EU  recommended recording Tuvalu's concerns in the meeting's minutes  instead of amending the draft conclusions. Tuvalu opposed this  suggestion.

On degradation of forests and devegetation of other vegetation  types, Parties debated whether the SBSTA should invite Parties to  submit their views on possible definitions and methodologies to  the Secretariat.

On Saturday, 6 December, the contact group continued discussions  on the revised draft conclusions and a draft COP decision,  centered on whether to recommend the GPG for reporting under the  UNFCCC as well as under the Protocol. Delegates also discussed how  to refer to the IPCC report on factoring out when taking note of  it in the decisions, and accounting of LULUCF activities.

In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, Co-Chair Margaret  Mukahanana-Sangarwe announced that Parties had agreed to recommend  the IPCC GPG for reporting under the UNFCCC, and to continue  considering reporting requirements under the Protocol at SBSTA-20,  with a view to making a decision by COP-10. On factoring out,  Parties agreed to note the IPCC report submitted to SBSTA by the  IPCC in response to a COP invitation.

On Tuesday, 9 December, the SBSTA adopted draft conclusions and  agreed to a decision to be forwarded to the COP, which adopted the  decision on Friday, 12 December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions on good practice guidance  and other information on LULUCF (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.22), SBSTA,  inter alia, requests submissions from Parties on degradation and  devegetation and on factoring out, in order to further review both  at SBSTA-20, and takes note of the IPCC expert meeting on current  scientific understanding of the processes affecting terrestrial  carbon stocks and human influences upon them.

###     COP Decision

In its decision on the use of GPG for preparing  national greenhouse gas inventories under the UNFCCC  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.22/Add.1), the COP decides to further consider  the common reporting format tables for reporting under the  Protocol at SBSTA-20. The COP also invites Parties to submit their  views on the draft common reporting format tables and on reporting  requirements under the Protocol, and requests the Secretariat to  update the draft tables to facilitate their consideration. The  decision includes sectoral tables in Annexes I-III that will be  integrated into the inventory reporting software under development  by the Secretariat.

###     Harvested wood products

This issue was taken up together with GPG  on LULUCF in the contact group co-chaired by Margaret  Mukahanana-Sangarwe and Audun Rosland. On Tuesday, 2 December,  Chair Thorgeirsson introduced to SBSTA a technical paper prepared  by the Secretariat on estimation, harvesting and accounting of  harvested wood products. The US proposed accounting for exports  and imports separately, and Tuvalu noted the need to account for  wood products harvested in developing countries and transferred to  developed countries. Parties agreed that this was an issue for the  second commitment period, and decided to forward it for further  consideration at SBSTA-20. In the contact group meeting on  Wednesday, 3 December, discussion centered around whether to hold  a workshop to build capacity, or whether to simply request  Parties' submissions on the issue. In the contact group on  Thursday, 4 December, delegates discussed the Co-Chairs' draft  conclusions. Text was bracketed on the reference to taking the  IPCC GPG into consideration when making submissions. On Tuesday,  9 December, SBSTA adopted the conclusions.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The SBSTA conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.21),  inter alia, invite Parties to submit their views on the issue, in  order to consider the matter further at SBSTA-20 and SBSTA-21, and  to hold a workshop before SBSTA-21, subject to the availability of  funds.

###     Issues relating to registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4

Reporting to SBSTA on pre-sessional consultations on registries on  Tuesday, 2 December, Murray Ward (New Zealand) emphasized the  importance of cooperation between administrators of registries and  of the transaction log. In the SBSTA Plenary held on Tuesday, 9  December, Ward outlined the scope of the draft conclusions, which  were then adopted by SBSTA.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/ SBSTA/2003/L.20),  SBSTA: takes note of the report on the development of the data  exchange standards and the transaction log; stresses the need for  the Secretariat to focus attention on the transaction log, and to  continue pursuing means to reduce the funding requirements  associated with the development of the transaction log; and urges  Annex II Parties to make exceptional efforts to contribute to the  supplemental Trust Fund to allow the necessary work on the  development of the transaction log to start at the beginning of  2004 and be completed before COP-10. SBSTA also urged each Party  listed in Protocol Annex B, which has not already designated its  registry administrator to maintain its national registry, to do so  as soon as possible, with a view to facilitating early cooperation  on the development of registries and the transaction log.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

In the Plenary on Tuesday, 2 December, the  Secretariat presented the UNFCCC technology information clearing  house (TT:CLEAR). William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana), Chair of  the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT), then presented the  EGTT's proposed work programme for 2004. Chair Thorgeirsson  requested Terry Carrington (UK) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad &  Tobago) to co-chair a contact group on the EGTT's programme of  work and related issues.

In the contact group on Wednesday, 3 December, Parties disagreed  on whether the draft text should be expanded, or whether it was  already 'ambitious' enough. Disagreement also arose regarding the  frequency of meetings proposed, with some developed countries  noting that the availability of EGTT members and budgetary  restrictions must be considered.

On Thursday, 4 December, the contact group agreed to forward a  proposal to SBI on guidance to the Global Environment Facility  (GEF) for consideration under the agenda item on the SCCF, and  agreed to note that work on technology transfer undertaken by  SBSTA complements work in other fora.

In the contact group on Saturday, 6 December, Parties recommended  amending text on support from international and other  organizations. Text was introduced on enhancing the 'push factor'  in developed countries to transfer technologies to developing  countries, assessments on technology transfer, joint research on  environmentally-sound technologies, and reporting on capacity- building activities relating to technology transfer in national  communications. Deliberations continued in informal discussions on  Saturday afternoon, 6 December, and Monday, 8 December.

Conclusions were adopted by SBSTA on Tuesday, 9 December.

Recalling the  conclusions of SBSTA-17, SBSTA also invites the SBI when  considering additional guidance to the GEF to give appropriate  consideration to addressing priority needs identified in the  regional action plans in relation to global observing systems for  climate.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.17/Add.1), the  COP requests Parties to review the second adequacy report within  the context of their national capabilities and to consider what  actions they can take to address the findings, noting inter alia,  the wealth of information that can be provided through the  digitization, analysis and exchange of historical information, and  the importance of adhering to applicable adopted principles of  free and unrestricted exchange of data and products. The COP  requests the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Secretariat to  coordinate the development of a phased 5-10 year implementation  plan for the integrated global observing systems for climate. The  COP also invites the GCOS Secretariat and the Ad Hoc Group on  Earth Observations (GEO) to collaborate closely in developing  their respective implementation plans, and the Ad Hoc Group on  Earth Observations to treat global climate monitoring as a  priority. The COP urges Parties in a position to do so to support  the priority needs in developing countries.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

On Tuesday,  2 December, a representative of the Convention on Biological  Diversity (CBD) outlined relevant outcomes of the ninth meeting of  its Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological  Advice, and presented key findings of the report of its Ad Hoc  Technical Expert Group on biological diversity and climate change.  The Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD) stated that its  recent COP-6 had adopted a decision encouraging the Joint Liaison  Group to identify further areas for joint activities.

The UN Inter-Agency Secretariat for the International Strategy for  Disaster Reduction outlined its work on mainstreaming climate  change adaptation into disaster reduction strategies.

Several Parties stressed the need to promote capacity building,  technology transfer and reporting as measures to support synergies.  FAO reported on its activities relating to agriculture, energy,  and rural development, and IUCN highlighted the need to integrate  climate change measures into the management of protected areas.  Chair Thorgeirsson said Outi Berghäll (Finland) and Marcela Maim  (Chile) would conduct informal consultations on draft SBSTA  conclusions.

In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, Co-Chair Berghäll  reported on the informal consultations. The EU said a workshop  co-organized by the CCD and CBD on identifying and promoting  synergies through forest and forest ecosystems would be held in  March 2004, in Viterbo, Italy. SBSTA adopted the conclusions.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.19) address  cooperation with other conventions, and cooperation with  scientific organizations and UN bodies. On cooperation with other  conventions, SBSTA notes the distinct mandates and independent  status of each convention, reiterates the importance of promoting  synergies at the national and local levels where implementation  occurs, and encourages Parties to strive for coherence in the  implementation of the conventions.

### OTHER MATTERS

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

SBI was chaired by Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria) and convened six  times from Monday, 1 December, to Wednesday, 10 December.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Adoption of the agenda: On Monday, 1  December, Chair Stoycheva opened the session, and introduced the  agenda for adoption (FCCC/SBI/2003/9 and Corr.1). Regarding the  sub-item on submission of second and third national communications,  the G-77/China objected to the reference to the 'frequency of'  submissions and, with Saudi Arabia, stressed the importance of  financial and technical support for preparing national  communications before addressing the issue of their timing.  Supporting the inclusion of this reference, the EU, with Australia,  noted that decision 17/CP.8 (guidelines for the preparation on  non-Annex I national communications) refers to the 'frequency of'  submissions.

On the sub-item dealing with the consideration of the fifth  compilation and synthesis of initial national communications, the  G-77/China, opposed by the US, objected to a document tabled by  the Secretariat on steps taken by non-Annex I Parties to reduce  emissions.

On the agenda item addressing the implementation of UNFCCC Article  4.8 and 4.9 (adverse affects), the EU and US emphasized the need  to discuss the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 (implementation  of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 on adverse effects) as a sub-item.  The G-77/China and others proposed that the agenda sub-item not be  restricted to decision 5/CP.7, but address all matters related to  Article 4.8. Following discussion, the agenda was adopted with  these two sub-items held in abeyance.

On Thursday, 4 December, Chair Stoycheva noted that, following  informal consultations, Parties had reached agreement on the two  agenda sub-items. Regarding submission of second and, where  appropriate, third national communications, Parties had agreed to  remove reference to 'frequency of.' On adverse effects, Parties  had agreed to consider the implementation of decision 5/CP.7,  rather than the implementation of Article 4.8. SBI adopted the  agenda as amended.

###     Election of officers other than the Chair

On Wednesday, 10  December, Chair Stoycheva indicated that Fadhel Lari (Kuwait) has  been elected as SBI Vice-Chair for a second term. She noted that  the SBI Rapporteur will be elected at SBI-20.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

On Monday, 1 December, the  SBI addressed the consideration of the fifth compilation and  synthesis of initial national communications, the work of the  Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national  communications (CGE), and provision of financial and technical  support in SBI, agreeing to convene a contact group, chaired by  Sok Appadu (Mauritius) to further consider non-Annex I national  communications.

On Thursday, 4 December, SBI addressed the issue of submission of  second, and where appropriate, third national communications. The  US suggested that non-Annex I national communications should be  submitted no more than four years after the submission of their  initial communications, and that LDCs should submit their  communications every five years. Regarding the submission of  greenhouse gas inventories, she proposed that non-Annex I Parties  should submit these every two years, and that LDCs should submit  inventories every five years, as part of their national  communications.

In the contact group on Friday, 5 December, Parties addressed the  fifth compilation and synthesis report and work of the CGE.  Parties addressed how CGE workshops should be organized, with the  EU, opposed by the G-77/China, suggesting that workshops could  address all thematic areas in a combined approach, rather than  addressing one theme only.

On Saturday, 6 December, the contact group considered provision of  financial and technical support, and the timing of submissions of  second and, where appropriate, third national communications. The  G-77/China noted that the preparation of national communications  is a continuous process, but that the frequency of submissions is  a 'non-issue.' Chair Appadu requested submissions from Parties on  their views, for inclusion in the draft conclusions and COP  decision.

In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, the G-77/China  suggested deleting text recognizing that the submission of  national communications would ensure that the COP has sufficient  information to assess the UNFCCC's implementation in a timely  manner. The EU proposed text that national communications assist  the COP to review the UNFCCC's implementation.

On Tuesday, 9 December, delegates met twice in the contact group.  The G-77/China suggested text stating that frequency of  submissions of national communications shall be dependent on the  availability of funding. The EU, US and Australia favored text  requiring that second national communications be submitted within  three years of the availability of financial resources. The  G-77/China underlined that it would not discuss the issue of  frequency of submissions. The US, opposed by the G-77/China,  recommended text requiring non-Annex I Parties to submit national  inventories every two years. Informal consultations continued  throughout the day.

On Wednesday, 10 December, SBI adopted its conclusions, and agreed  to forward a draft decision to the COP.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions on the work of the CGE  (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.24), SBI takes note of the work programme of the  CGE for 2003-7. It requests the CGE and the Secretariat to invite  experts working on the different areas of national communications,  taking into account other relevant activities and programmes, such  as national adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs), in order to  enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the workshops. SBI  also acknowledges that existing financial and technical resource  allocations may be insufficient to fulfill the CGE's work needs,  and invites Annex II Parties to contribute financial resources.  SBI also encourages the CGE to take into account activities of the  GEF/UNDP/UNEP's National Communications Support Programme.

In the conclusions on provision of financial and technical support  (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.25), SBI invites Parties to continue to submit  views on their experiences with the GEF and its implementing  agencies in relation to the preparation of national communications,  and requests the GEF secretariat to compile this information and  make it available to the SBI.

In the conclusions on submission of second and, where appropriate,  third national communications (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.30), SBI agrees to  continue consideration of this matter at SBI-20.

###     COP Decision

In its decision on the consideration of the fifth  compilation and synthesis of initial national communications  (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.23), the COP concludes, inter alia, that: many  non-Annex I Parties have submitted projects for funding; the  enhancement of capacity and support is necessary for the  maintenance of capacity built during the preparation of national  communications; and there continues to be a need for financial and  technical support to enhance national capacities in non-Annex I  Parties to prepare second and, where appropriate, third national  communications. The COP requests the Secretariat to prepare a  compilation and synthesis of information contained in initial  national communications submitted up to 1 April 2005, and a  document on possible means to facilitate the implementation of  projects proposed for funding by non-Annex I Parties.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM OF THE UNFCCC

Special Climate Change Fund: In  the SBI Plenary on Tuesday, 2 December, the EU said the SCCF  should be used as a catalyst for leveraging additional resources  from bilateral and multilateral sources. China urged the  establishment of a procedure for the replenishment of the SCCF.  Chair Stoycheva established a contact group, co-chaired by  Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Frode Neergaard (Denmark), to  prepare a draft COP decision.

In the contact group meeting on Wednesday, 3 December, several  countries underlined the priority of financing projects in line  with agreed decisions on adaptation and technology transfer.  Colombia, supported by Peru, proposed categorizing projects as  small, medium or large scale. The G-77/China underscored the  importance of addressing sources of finance and mechanisms for  dispersal. Micronesia stressed the need for expedited access, and  South Africa said the level of funding to ensure the  sustainability of the SCCF needed to be addressed.

In the contact group on Thursday, 4 December, the Co-Chairs  presented a draft COP decision. Nigeria, for the G-77/China, said  the draft decision could not be used as the basis of negotiation,  emphasizing that it did not contain sufficient guidance on  operational procedures. The EU, Canada and Norway said the draft  decision provided a good basis for negotiations.

On Friday, 5 December, the contact group undertook a paragraph-by- paragraph reading of the text. The G-77/China said that the SCCF  should be financed from new and additional funds, and that the  funding level of the SCCF should match that of the GEF's climate  change focal area. The G-77/China, opposed by the EU and Norway,  stressed the need for text supporting predictable and adequate  funding levels. On the inclusion of activities in decision 7/CP.7  (funding under the UNFCCC), particularly on economic  diversification, the EU, with Norway, opposed by the G-77/China,  called for the deletion of the reference.

In the contact group meeting on Saturday, 6 December, the  Co-Chairs presented a revised draft COP decision. The G-77/China  expressed concerns that the draft decision had not incorporated  elements regarding the predictability and the new and additional  nature of the funding, and had excluded references to technology  transfer as it relates to adaptation. The Co-Chairs suspended the  contact group to allow for informal consultations.

In the contact group on Monday, 9 December, discussion focused on  operative paragraphs dealing with SCCF principles and the  definition of adaptation projects. Opposing a proposal by the EU  to include references to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),  the G-77/China insisted that such references should only be  addressed in the preambular text. Delegates could not agree to a  Canadian proposal to use non-Annex I national communications as  the basis for defining adaptation and technology transfer  priorities.

In the contact group on Wednesday, 10 December, Co-Chair Moore  presented a second revision of the Co-Chairs' draft COP decision,  noting that it was a 'take it or leave it' text. The EU, Canada  and Japan, opposed by the G-77/China, said they could accept the  Co-Chairs' text. The G-77/China proposed alternative text  regarding the prioritization of, and funding for, economic  diversification activities. Following further informal  consultations, Co-Chair Moore said the draft COP decision would be  forwarded to SBI with bracketed text. In the SBI Plenary on  Wednesday, 10 December, SBI agreed to forward the draft decision  to the COP President for further action. The G-77/China, Argentina,  China, and Saudi Arabia expressed concern over lack of progress on  this issue and suggested that developed countries were failing to  meet their COP-7 obligations.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2003/L.8), the COP notes  that the SCCF supports the implementation of the UNFCCC,  contributes to the achievement of the WSSD and the MDGs, and  contributes to the integration of climate change considerations  into development activities. The COP decides to support the  implementation of adaptation activities, taking into account  national communications or NAPAs, and other relevant information  provided by the applicant Party. Regarding the use of resources  from the SCCF, the COP decides that resources shall be used to  fund technology transfer activities, programmes and measures that  are complementary to those currently funded by the GEF in the  following priority areas: implementation of the results of  technology needs assessments; technology information; capacity  building for technology transfer; and enabling environments. The  COP also decides that activities relating to economic  diversification are to be funded, and invites Parties to submit to  the Secretariat, by 15 September 2004, further views on activities,  programmes and measures in these areas for further consideration  by SBI-21 and COP-10.

###     Report of the GEF to the COP

This issue was addressed by SBI on  Tuesday, 2 December, and in informal consultations conducted by  SBI Chair Stoycheva. On Tuesday, 2 December, the GEF highlighted  its initiatives on climate change. Tanzania, for the LDCs,  stressed the need for expedited procedures for the approval of  NAPAs. China and Brazil urged accelerated funding for second  national communications, and Algeria expressed concern about lack  of progress and funding. On Wednesday, 10 December, SBI agreed to  forward the decision to the COP, which adopted it on Friday, 12  December. The COP also took note of the Report of the GEF  (FCCC/CP/2003/3).

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.27), the COP  decides to request the GEF to report to COP-10 on the  implementation of the strategic approach to enhancing capacity  building, and the framework for meaningful and effective actions  to enhance the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (development  and transfer of technologies).

###     Additional guidance to the GEF

This issue was addressed in the  SBI Plenary on Tuesday, 2 December. Chair Stoycheva requested  Andrea Albán (Colombia) to conduct informal consultations with the  relevant contact group chairs, and prepare a draft omnibus COP  decision. On Wednesday, 10 December, SBI agreed to forward the  decision to the COP, which adopted it on Friday, 12 December.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.28), the COP  requests the GEF to monitor the performance of the 'global  project' to support the preparation of national communications,  and provide finance in a timely manner for the preparation of  national communications by non-Annex I Parties not covered by the  'global project.' Regarding capacity building, the COP decides to  request the GEF to provide support for the implementation of the  capacity-building frameworks annexed to decision 2/CP.7 (capacity  building in developing countries) and decision 3/CP.7 (capacity  building in countries with economies in transition (EITs)). On  matters relating to technology transfer, the COP decides to  request the GEF to continue to support enabling activities  relating to technology needs assessments. It also requests the GEF  to continue support for education, training and public awareness,  and to operationalize as soon as possible the new strategic  priority in the climate change focal area on adaptation.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

On Tuesday, 2 December, several Parties  highlighted the need to document best practice and lessons learned.  Chair Stoycheva said that a contact group, chaired by Dechen  Tsering (Bhutan), would prepare a draft COP decision.

On Wednesday, 3 December, the contact group considered actions and  steps to complete the comprehensive review of the implementation  of the framework for capacity building in developing countries.  Parties discussed a request to the Secretariat to produce a  technical paper on lessons learned. The G-77/China, supported by  the EU, stressed the importance of the Secretariat also  considering gaps and shortfalls in implementing the framework.  Chair Tsering said informal consultations would be held to prepare  a draft COP decision.

On Friday, 5 December, the contact group discussed the Chair's  draft decision. Parties decided that submissions requested from  Parties would be incorporated into a text on the effectiveness of  capacity building in developing countries to be prepared by the  Secretariat by SBI-20. On guidance to the GEF, Croatia proposed  that the GEF's approach to enhancing capacity building should be  to respond to the framework for capacity building in EITs. Parties  decided to forward bracketed text on further guidance to the GEF  for consideration under the relevant agenda item.

On Saturday, 6 December, the contact group considered the Chair's  revised draft COP decision. Delegates were unable to agree on  whether to hold a workshop to facilitate an exchange of views and  experience on the implementation of decision 2/CP.7. Chair Tsering  said she would consult informally with Parties.

On Tuesday, 9 December, Chair Tsering presented a report of the  contact group's work and SBI agreed to forward the draft decision  to the COP, which adopted it on Friday, 12 December.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.19), the COP  decides to: complete the first comprehensive review of the  implementation of the framework for capacity building in  developing countries by COP-10; conduct further comprehensive  reviews every five years thereafter; request the Secretariat to  prepare a technical paper on the range and effectiveness of  capacity-building activities in developing countries for  consideration by SBI-20; and invite Parties to submit to the  Secretariat, by 15 February 2004, additional information as an  input to the technical paper. The COP also encourages EITs, in  preparing their national communications, to provide information on  the implementation of the framework for capacity building in their  countries. The COP requests the Secretariat to prepare a  compilation and synthesis report on capacity-building activities  in EITs based on, inter alia, information provided by the GEF, for  consideration by SBI-20.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

In the SBI Plenary on Tuesday, 2 December,  delegates suggested that national communications include  information on obstacles to implementing Article 6 (education,  training and public awareness), highlighted the need for a  country-driven focus, and called for technical and financial  assistance. Several Parties emphasized the importance of regional  workshops. Chair Stoycheva requested Markus Nauser (Switzerland)  to conduct informal consultations and prepare draft conclusions.  In the SBI Plenary on Tuesday, 9 December, SBI adopted the  conclusions. Fatou Ndeye Gaye (the Gambia) reported on the  informal consultations, and the Secretariat clarified the nature,  role and method of work of the temporary advisory committee  working on the prompt start of the Article 6 clearing house.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.20), SBI  urges: the provision of guidance to the Secretariat for the  implementation of the clearing house; the further exploration of  possible institutions that could house the clearing house; work to  contribute to a small-scale version of the clearing house; and the  organization of a pre-sessional workshop to receive feedback on  the further development of the clearing house. SBI requests the  Secretariat, subject to the availability of resources, to set up  an interim informal advisory group to facilitate the prompt start  of the preparation phase of the clearing house SBI encourages Parties to report on the six key areas of Article 6  in their national communications, notes, inter alia, that  additional and/or separate interim reports on the implementation  of the New Delhi Work Programme on Article 6 will remain a  voluntary initiative by Parties.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

Progress on the  implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7: In SBI on  Thursday, 4 December, Chair Stoycheva indicated that Rob Mason (UK)  and Al Waleed Al-Malik (United Arab Emirates) would co-chair a  contact group to prepare a draft COP decision on this matter.

In the contact group on Friday, 5 December, the G-77/China called  for substantive discussions on implementation of decision 5/CP.7,  with a view to building on existing work. Stating that, in terms  of the UNFCCC, adaptation is the priority, AOSIS underlined, inter  alia, the need for building capacity, addressing insurance  challenges, and improving access to funding. Saudi Arabia  underscored the need to take immediate action, support developing  countries in the technical development of non-energy uses of  fossil fuels, and exchange information on win-win P&Ms that reduce  greenhouse gas emissions, while minimizing adverse impacts on  developing countries.

In the contact group on Monday, 8 December, delegates considered  how to reflect the level of progress made on the implementation of  decision 5/CP.7. Opposed by the G-77/China, Australia suggested  welcoming 'significant' progress in the implementation of 5/CP.7.  Parties also discussed how to address views on insurance.

Following informal consultations on the draft conclusions late  Tuesday night, 9 December, Saudi Arabia, opposed by the  G-77/China, Micronesia, US, EU, New Zealand, Australia, Japan and  Canada, reversed its earlier support for text on reporting on  actions to address the adverse affects of response measures, and  proposed adding brackets. Following informal consultations, the  group agreed to the draft conclusions, without amendment, and to  include Saudi Arabia's proposal in the draft negotiating text to  be included in the annex to the draft conclusions.

On Wednesday, 10 December, contact group Co-Chair Mason reported  to SBI, noting that the conclusions contain a bracketed COP  decision. The SBI adopted the conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.26), SBI  invites Parties and relevant international organizations to submit  information on current and/or planned activities including support  programmes to meet the specific needs and circumstances of  developing country Parties arising from the adverse effects of  climate change under decision 5/CP.7. SBI also decides to continue  its consideration of the agenda item at SBI-20 on the basis of the  draft text contained in the conclusions.

###     Matters relating to the LDCs

The matter of UNFCCC Article 4.9  (LDCs) was taken up by SBI on Tuesday, 2 December. La'avasa Malua  (Samoa), Chair of the LDC Expert Group (LEG), outlined outcomes of  the LEG's activities, noting that many LDC stakeholders had  expressed the need for longer-term support. Richard Muyungi  (Tanzania), Chair of the LDCs, said implementation of numerous  elements of the LDC work programme remain incomplete. Bangladesh,  with the EU and Canada, supported the extension of the LEG's  mandate, and highlighted complementarity between the LDC Fund and  the SCCF. Chair Stoycheva reported that Mamadou Honadia (Burkina  Faso) and José Romero (Switzerland) would facilitate informal  consultations on this matter and prepare a draft COP decision.

In Plenary on Wednesday, 10 December, Co-Chair Romero reported to  SBI on the informal consultations, noting lack of agreement on  further guidance to the LDC Fund. SBI agreed to forward draft  decisions to the COP on review of the guidelines for the  preparation of NAPAs, and extension of the mandate of the LEG.  Regarding draft conclusions on assessing the status of  implementation of Article 4.9 (LDCs), Tanzania, for the LDCs,  objected to references stating that SBI expressed its satisfaction  at the progress achieved so far in implementing the LDC work  programme.

Following deliberations in Plenary, SBI agreed to forward the  draft conclusions on assessing the status of implementation of  Article 4.9 to the COP, amending them to note that progress on the  implementation of Article 4.9 will be assessed at COP-10.  Regarding draft SBI conclusions noting that the SBI had been  unable to complete discussions on guidance for the operation of  the LDC Fund, Tanzania, for the LDCs, stressed the need to reach  agreement on this issue at COP-9. SBI agreed to forward the issue  to the President Persányi for continued consultations.

Following informal consultations facilitated by President Persányi  and Roger Cornforth (New Zealand), the COP adopted the conclusions  on assessing the status of implementation of Article 4.9, and a  decision on further guidance for the operation of the LDC Fund on  Friday, 12 December.

###     COP Conclusions

In the conclusions on assessing the status of  implementation of Article 4.9 (FCCC/CP/2003/L.7), the COP notes  progress made so far in implementing one of the elements of the  LDC work programme adopted by decision 5/CP.7. It also notes the  responses by Annex II Parties relating to the provision of  resources to the LDC Fund for the preparation of NAPAs, as well as  the effective support and guidance provided by the LEG. The COP  emphasizes the need to begin work on the remaining elements of the  LDC work programme, and notes that it will assess the status of  implementation of Article 4.9 at COP-10, with a view to  considering further action.

###     COP Decision

s: In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.29/Add.2), the COP  decides to extend the LEG's mandate. The COP invites Annex II  Parties to contribute to funding that supports the activities of  the LEG. It also decides to review the progress, need for  continuation, and terms of reference of the LEG at COP-11.

In the decision on review of the guidelines for the preparation of  NAPAs (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.29/Add.1), the COP decides that no revision  of the guidelines is necessary at this time.

In the decision on further guidance on the operation of the LDC  Fund (FCCC/CP/2003/L.9), the COP decides to adopt the further  guidance to an entity entrusted with the operation of the  financial mechanism of the UNFCCC for the operation of the LDC  Fund. The COP requests the entity to take into account various  elements when developing operational guidelines for funding the  implementation of NAPAs, including:the need to ensure a country-driven approach, in line with  national priorities, which ensures cost-effectiveness and  complementarity with other funding sources; equitable access by LDCs to funding for the implementation of  NAPAs; criteria for supporting activities on an agreed full-cost  basis, taking account of the level of funds available; guidelines for expedited support; urgency and immediacy of adapting to the adverse effects of  climate change; and prioritization of activities.

The COP also decides to assess progress made in implementing the  decision and to consider the adoption of further guidance at  COP-10.

### REQUEST FROM A GROUP OF COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL ASIA AND THE CAUCASUS,  ALBANIA AND MOLDOVA ON THEIR STATUS UNDER THE UNFCCC

The request  from a group of countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus,  Albania and Moldova (CACAM) regarding their status under the  UNFCCC was considered by SBI on Tuesday, 2 December. Uzbekistan  requested a COP decision to enable CACAM to receive financial  support and its experts to be nominated and participate in expert  groups. Chair Stoycheva said she would conduct informal  consultations on the issue. In the SBI Plenary on Wednesday, 10  December, SBI Chair Stoycheva said no agreement had been reached  on the matter. In the COP Plenary on Friday, 12 December,  President Persányi proposed, and the COP agreed, that the matter  would be dealt with at future COP sessions.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Interim financial  performance for the biennium 2002-3: This issue was discussed in  the SBI Plenary on Tuesday, 2 December, and in informal  consultations conducted by Chair Stoycheva. Switzerland noted  concern over the high reliance on voluntary contributions to  priority activities in the core budget. On Wednesday, 11 December,  the SBI Plenary agreed to forward the decision to the COP, which  adopted it on Friday, 12 December.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.16), the COP  encourages all Parties that have not yet paid their contributions  to do so without further delay, and expresses concern at the  continuing trend of late payments of contributions.

###     Programme budget for the biennium 2004-5

In the SBI Plenary on  Tuesday, 2 December, Japan stressed its support for a nominal  zero-growth budget. The EU underlined the importance of adequate  and secure resources, and proposed that the COP consider the  adoption of the Euro as the currency for future budgets. The US  opposed the inclusion of the development costs of the Protocol in  the Secretariat's core budget, and with Australia, called for  separate UNFCCC and Protocol budgets. Chair Stoycheva said John  Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) would chair a contact group on this  issue.

In the contact group on Wednesday, 3 December, the G-77/China  called for a geographical and gender balance in the Secretariat,  supported the inclusion of Protocol-related activities in the  Secretariat's core budget, and urged more resources to support  developing country participation in UNFCCC-related processes. In  the contact group on Thursday, 4 December, New Zealand, the  G-77/China and Uganda, supported a 9% budget increase. In the  contact group on Saturday, 6 December, the EU and New Zealand said  Protocol development activities should remain in the core budget.  Chair Ashe said he would develop separate scales and budgets for  the Protocol and UNFCCC. On Monday, 8 December, Chair Ashe  distributed a revised draft COP decision, which was approved by  Parties.

In the SBI Plenary on Wednesday, 10 December, the SBI agreed to  forward the draft decision to the COP, with a minor amendment. SBI  also took note of a concern by Argentina on the scales of  assessment.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2003/L.4), the COP approves  the programme budget amounting to US$34,807,326, and adopts the  indicative scale of contributions for 2004 and 2005 for the  programme budget, and the indicative scale of contributions for  2005 to determine contributions by Parties to the Protocol. The  COP also notes: that the programme budget contains elements  relating to the UNFCCC, and elements relating to preparatory  activities under the Protocol; and that Protocol-related elements  expressly reflected in the core budget, the interim allocation and  the supplemental Trust Fund together constitute the portion of the  overall resource requirements relating to the Protocol. The COP  also approves an interim allocation amounting to US$ 5,455,793 to  carry out activities relating to the Protocol.

###     Participation of Parties in Arrears

In the SBI Plenary on Tuesday,  9 December, Argentina and Brazil opposed the Secretariat's  practice of withholding financial support for the participation in  UNFCCC-related meetings by Parties in arrears. Chair Stoycheva  said she would undertake informal consultations on this matter. On  Wednesday, 10 December, Chair Stoycheva reported on informal  consultations and proposed that the SBI take note of the concern  and recommend that the practice be suspended through to COP-10.  She also said SBI would request the Secretariat to review the  implications of this on developing countries and EITs and report  to SBI-20 on this matter.

### OTHER MATTERS

Proposal by Croatia on LULUCF and special  circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6: These issues  were presented to the SBI on Tuesday, 2 December. After informal  consultations undertaken by Jim Penman (UK), SBI adopted  conclusions and agreed to forward to the COP a draft decision,  which was adopted on Friday, 12 December.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions on the special circumstances  of Croatia under Article 4.6 (special circumstances of EITs)  (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.18), the SBI notes the information provided by  Croatia on anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by  sinks, as well as projections of its greenhouse gas emissions.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.17/Add.1), the COP  decides that, for the first commitment period, additions to and  subtractions from the assigned amount of Croatia resulting from  forest management, and forest-management project activities, shall  not exceed 0.265 megatonnes of carbon per year, times five.

Status report on the review of third Annex I national  communications: On Tuesday, 2 December, the Secretariat said 36  Annex I Parties had submitted national communications.

###     Any other matters

SBI addressed two issues under this agenda item.  On Tuesday, 2 December, Parties discussed a proposal by Belarus to  use 1990 as its base-year. The EU said only the COP/MOP has  authority to decide on the issue. Chair Stoycheva said she would  prepare draft conclusions on the issue. On Tuesday, 9 December,  Chair Stoycheva introduced draft conclusions on this matter, which  were adopted.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.21), SBI  notes the submission by Belarus to use 1990 as its base year and  requests the Secretariat to make available the report on the  in-depth review of Belarus' first national communication before  SBI-20.

### REPORT OF THE SESSION

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Organizational matters were taken up on  Monday, 1 December. The COP agreed to apply the draft Rules of  Procedure, except for Rule 42 (voting). President Persányi noted  that he would consult with Parties and report to COP-10 on  adopting the Rules of Procedure in their entirety.

President Persányi presented the agenda for adoption  (FCCC/CP/2003/1 and Add.1), noting that the COP-8 Bureau had  recommended that the item on the second review of the adequacy of  commitments under UNFCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b) be held in  abeyance. Saudi Arabia, supported by Oman and the EU, and opposed  by Canada, requested the exclusion of a Canadian proposal on  modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts in relation to  cleaner energy exports.

Parties adopted the agenda, with the items on the second review of  adequacy of commitments, the proposal by Canada on cleaner energy  exports, and matters relating to Protocol Article 2.3 held in  abeyance. President Persányi agreed to consult with Parties on  these items.

Election of officers other than the President: On Friday, 12  December, President Persányi said the following Vice-Presidents  had been elected: Mamdou Honadia (Burkina Faso); José Ovalle  (Chile); Outi Berghäll (Finland); Helen Plume (New Zealand); Jawed  Ali Khan (Pakistan); Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu); and Ahmed Saeed Majid  (United Arab Emirates). He said Jeffery Spooner (Jamaica) was  elected COP Rapporteur and Abdullaltif Benrageb (Libya) as Chair  of SBSTA.

###     Date and venue of COP-10

On Wednesday, 10 December, Argentina  offered to host COP-10 in Buenos Aires. At the high-level segment  on Thursday, 11 December, President Persányi noted Argentina's  offer and said several Parties had proposed changing the date of  COP-10. He requested Parties to consult on this matter. On Friday,  12 December, President Persányi announced that COP-10 would be  held in Argentina from 29 November to 10 December 2004.

### REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS AND OF OTHER PROVISIONS OF  THE UNFCCC

On Thursday, 4 December, delegates presented their  views on this item, with the Russian Federation, Belarus and  Slovenia reporting that the decline in emissions in their  countries is due to the decoupling of GDP and emissions, and not  due to economic decline. The G-77/China expressed concern over the  increase in Annex I emissions and appealed for political  commitment. Argentina, opposed by the US, questioned the  appropriateness of the emissions intensity measurement. AOSIS,  with Bangladesh, said that failure to mitigate emissions has  resulted in the need to increase adaptation measures. Iceland  called for the application and transfer of existing technologies,  and South Africa called for demonstrable leadership by Annex I  Parties. President Persányi said José Ovalle (Chile) and Michael  Zammit-Cutajar (Malta) would co-chair a contact group on this  issue.

On Friday, 5 December, the contact group discussed a draft COP  decision. Argentina noted omissions regarding the extent of delay  in submission of documents, problems in the implementation of P&Ms,  and increasing emissions levels. The US said references to  commitments under the Protocol may be premature, questioned the  interpretation of Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (fulfillment of  commitments by developed country Parties) and objected to the  focus on international aviation. Opposed by the EU, the G-77/China  suggested removing reference to Article 4.2 throughout the draft  decision, noting that such reference was judgmental.

In the COP Plenary on Friday, 12 December, Co-Chair Ovalle  reported on the work of the contact group, and the COP adopted the  decision. Argentina stressed that future discussions on this  matter should include the need to have comparable methodologies  for measuring greenhouse gas emission projections, and Saudi  Arabia said the impacts of Annex I P&Ms on developing countries  dependent on fossil fuel exports also need to be addressed.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/2003/CP/L.3), the COP notes  that: aggregate greenhouse gas emissions of Annex I Parties in  2000 were below their 1990 levels largely because of decreases in  EIT emissions; emissions in energy and transport sectors had  increased in 2000 above 1990 levels; and emissions from  international civil aviation had increased more than 40% in the  period 1990-2000. The COP concludes that further action is needed  by Annex I Parties to implement P&Ms that will contribute to  modifying longer-term trends in anthropogenic emissions and urges  these Parties to intensify their efforts in this regard. The COP  urges those Annex I Parties that have not submitted their national  communications or their annual greenhouse gas inventories to do so  as a matter of priority.

In addition, the COP stresses the need for Parties included in  Annex II to the UNFCCC to provide detailed information on their  assistance to developing country Parties that are particularly  vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in meeting  costs of adaptation to those adverse effects. It encourages SBSTA  to consider ways of improving the transparency of greenhouse gas  projections in time to contribute to the preparation of fourth  national communications.

### OTHER MATTERS REFERRED TO THE COP BY THE SUBSIDIARY BODIES

Numerous decisions forwarded by SBSTA-18 were adopted by COP-9,  (contained in FCCC/SBSTA/2003/10/Add.1-2). On issues relating to  Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information), the COP adopted a  decision on implementation of Article 8, containing a draft  COP/MOP decision on the same matter, and a decision on technical  guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Protocol Article  5.2 (adjustments), containing a draft COP/MOP decision. On issues  relating to reporting and review of Annex I inventories, the COP  adopted a decision on issues relating to the technical review of  greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I Parties. On research and  systematic observation, the COP adopted a decision on global  observing systems for climate.

###     SECOND REVIEW OF ADEQUACY OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.2(a) and (b)

On  Monday, 1 December, President Persányi said the agenda item on  second review of adequacy of UNFCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b)  (fulfillment of commitments by developed country Parties) was held  in abeyance, noting that he would consult informally with Parties  on this matter. On Friday, 12 December, he noted that no agreement  had been reached, and indicated that the item would be forwarded  to COP-10.

### REPORT OF THE CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

On Thursday, 4 December, Japan  and the EU called for accelerated project registration. Climate  Action Network urged equitable distribution of CDM projects,  designated operational entities (DOEs) and experts. President  Persányi said Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu) would conduct informal  consultations on this matter.

On Friday, 12 December, Enele Sopoaga reported on informal  consultations, and the Secretariat informed delegates that the  following members had been elected onto the CDM EB: Marina  Shvangiradze (Georgia), Georg Børsting (Norway), Richard Muyungi  (Tanzania), John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), and José Miguez  (Brazil). The COP also adopted a decision on guidance to the EB.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2003/L.2), the COP decides  that a CDM project activity starting between the date of adoption  of decision 17/CP.7 (modalities and procedures for the CDM) and  the date of the first registration of a CDM project activity may  use a crediting period starting before the date of its  registration if the project activity is submitted for registration  before 31 December 2005. The COP also decides to: request Parties  to promote capacity building with a view to obtaining more  applications for accreditation as DOEs from entities located in  non-Annex I Parties; encourage the EB to intensify work on  methodologies; and to invite Parties to urgently make  contributions to the UNFCCC supplemental Trust Fund.

### OTHER MATTERS

On Thursday, 4 December, Switzerland, speaking for  the Parties of the 2001 Bonn Political Declaration on Financing  for Developing Countries (Canada, the EU, Iceland, New Zealand,  Norway and Switzerland), reaffirmed the political commitment made  during COP-6 part II to provide US$410 million to developing  countries on an annual basis, beginning in 2005. He noted that  steps are being taken toward fulfilling this commitment.

# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

The high-level segment took place on Wednesday and Thursday, 10-11  December. On 10 December, Parties heard statements in the morning,  and engaged in the first round-table discussions, in the afternoon.  On 11 December, Parties met in the two final round-table  discussions.

Opening the segment, President Persányi commended delegates'  commitment to action and leadership. He noted that the UNFCCC and  its Protocol are the only viable options for preventing dangerous  interference with the global climate. Speaking on behalf of  Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Altero Matteoli, Italy's  Minister for the Environment and Territory, said the Draft Treaty  establishing a Constitution for Europe provides for EU Member  States to fulfill their obligations to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. Speaking on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,  José Antonio Ocampo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and  Social Affairs, encouraged Annex I Parties who have not yet  ratified the Protocol to do so as soon as possible and emphasized  the importance of the MDGs. Joke Waller-Hunter, UNFCCC Executive  Secretary, said COP-9 has demonstrated that, in the presence of  commitment and political will, it is possible to establish sound  institutional frameworks for action.

### ROUND-TABLE DISCUSSIONS

Three high-level round-table discussions  were held from 10-11 December on 'climate change, adaptation,  mitigation and sustainable development,' 'technology, including  technology use and development and transfer of technologies,' and  'assessment of progress at the national, regional and  international levels.' President Persányi prepared a President's  Summary of the round-table discussions (FCCC/CP/2003/CRP.1).

Round-Table I - 'Climate change, adaptation, mitigation and  sustainable development:' This round-table was co-chaired by  Yuriko Koike, Minister of Environment, Japan, and Tadashi Lometo,  Minister of Health and Environment, Marshall Islands. Co-Chair  Koike stressed the need to analyze the current state of progress  and identify further actions. Co-Chair Lometo emphasized the  vulnerability of SIDS. In the first part of the round-table,  Parties discussed poverty eradication, economic growth and food  security. Several Parties called for entry into force of the  Protocol and sufficient financial support for developing countries  to respond to climate change. Morocco, for the G-77/China, said  adaptation and mitigation measures will be unsuccessful if  developed countries ignore the concerns and situation of  vulnerable States. Benin stressed the importance of integrating  poverty reduction and adaptation measures.

On the issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, Italy, for the  EU, said developed countries must make a greater effort and  developing countries must also take steps towards this end. New  Zealand underlined the vulnerability of SIDS and noted threats to  island cultures. Slovenia, with others, said they would fulfill  their Protocol commitments in the absence of the Protocol's entry  into force. Mozambique, with Belgium, called for 'more action and  less talk.' Panama said adaptation should be given the same status  as mitigation under the UNFCCC.

In the second part of the round-table, Parties addressed  vulnerability, climate-related disasters, impacts and adaptation.  Argentina called for a mechanism to facilitate adaptation projects.  Samoa expressed hope that the SCCF would fund community-based  adaptation projects. The Russian Federation said that remaining  uncertainties regarding whether mitigation efforts will be  effective for reducing climate change justify pursuing adaptation.  Burkina Faso questioned the purpose of NAPAs if mechanisms for  their implementation are not in place. China said once developed  countries have taken the lead in mitigating emissions, developing  countries would be able to make a contribution. Austria stated  that nuclear power is not an option for combating climate change.  Nepal said that despite his country's insignificant contribution  to climate change, efforts toward mitigating emissions are  underway.

In the third part of the round-table, delegates discussed  adaptation and mitigation in national development. France  emphasized that this century will either be recorded as the  century of climate change suffering and collective  irresponsibility or the century of climate control and the  maturing of humanity. Saudi Arabia said that mitigation and  adaptation measures must not lead to new commitments for  developing countries.

Round-Table II - 'Technology, including technology use and  development and transfer of technologies:' The second round-table  discussion was co-chaired by Paula Dobriansky, Under-Secretary for  Global Affairs, US, and Mohammed Valli Moosa, Minister of  Environmental Affairs and Tourism, South Africa. Co-Chair  Dobriansky raised questions on promoting access to technology in  developing countries, and harnessing the private sector in  advancing clean technology. Co-Chair Moosa stressed a focus on  actions that can already be taken. He proposed drawing up an  inventory of existing technologies.

In the first part of the round-table discussions, Parties  addressed facilitating technology innovation, development and  diffusion for mitigation and adaptation in the context of  sustainable development. Ireland, for the EU, stressed the  importance of decoupling economic growth and emissions, said  renewables are a priority, and noted that technology transfer can  occur on South-South and North-South bases. Burundi expressed  concern over access to data from developed countries. Iceland  called for vision, leadership and partnership, and for engaging  the business community. India expressed concern that the only  concrete outcome of calls for technology transfer is TT:CLEAR.  Rwanda said donors must address the need for poverty reduction  when transferring technologies. The Indigenous Peoples'  Organizations called for greater participation and securing  indigenous peoples' prior informed consent when undertaking action.

Suriname underlined the need to transfer sustainable development  technologies, building capacity and addressing recipient country  needs. Sweden said policy-makers should focus on equity issues and  modalities for the adoption of technologies at local levels. Chad  requested a list of the technologies that have been transferred to  developing countries. Spain urged the establishment of  institutional frameworks to facilitate investment by the private  sector in projects that promote sustainable development.

In the second part of the discussions, Parties spoke on  development assistance, research, technology development  cooperation, partnerships, capacity building, financing and  enabling environments. Malawi said commitments should be  translated into concrete actions, including technology transfer  and poverty alleviation. The Republic of Korea, for the  Environmental Integrity Group, emphasized the importance of  publicly funded technologies and support to the private sector.  Cuba stressed the need to consider economic and social contexts  when transferring technology. Belgium highlighted the need to  focus on clean energy and reducing emissions, not end-of-pipe  solutions. In response to Belgium, Saudi Arabia said the UNFCCC's  aim is not to reduce oil dependency. The UK outlined emissions  projects and stressed the need for the development of low carbon  technologies, immediate use of existing technologies, and clean  development trajectories. The G-77/China called for effective  support for technology transfer in non-Annex I Parties and  research to encourage local-level capacity building. The Ukraine  said EITs could reduce emissions through using the latest  technologies and renewables.

In the third part of the round-table, Parties discussed private  sector involvement, market mechanisms, and public-private  partnerships. Malaysia noted the importance of tax incentives.  Business and Industry NGOs urged governments to provide enabling  frameworks, and said that non-commercial investments are needed  for long-term commitment. The US emphasized public-private  partnerships and noted national programmes on carbon sequestration,  hydrogen and nuclear energy. Ghana said technology transfer must  include know-how and human-resource development. Noting that the  Protocol is the only viable option, Japan stressed developing  common rules to apply to all countries. Chile underscored the role  played by market conditions in ensuring cleaner technology. The  Gambia underlined the need for appropriate technologies, capacity  building, and enhanced international cooperation. Mozambique said  LDCs with limited private sectors need capacity building to  participate in the technology-transfer process.

Round-Table III - 'Assessment of progress at the national,  regional and international levels:' The final round-table on  'assessment of progress at the national, regional and  international levels to fulfill the promise and objective  enshrined in the climate change agreements, including the  scientific, information, policy and financial aspects' was  co-chaired by Fernando Tudela Abad, Chief of Staff of the  Secretariat for Environment, Natural Resources and Fisheries,  Mexico, and Jürgen Trittin, Minister for the Environment, Nature  Conservation and Nuclear Safety, Germany. Co-Chair Tudela Abad  said the CDM faces challenges arising from the delay in the  Protocol's entry into force, limited markets, and 'crippling'  transaction costs. Co-Chair Trittin said the UNFCCC obliges all  Parties to tackle climate change, and questioned the extent to  which developed countries have taken the lead in combating climate  change and addressing adverse effects.

In the first part of the round-table, Parties discussed lessons  learned from local and national climate change measures. The Czech  Republic said cooperation should be based on clear rules. Yemen  expressed concern at the reluctance of Annex I Parties to take  necessary actions to address climate change. The Netherlands said  it would continue to implement its Protocol obligations in the  absence of the Russian Federation's ratification. Kazakhstan said  it is preparing procedures for the Protocol's ratification. Iran  underscored the benefits of economic diversification and stressed  Parties' common but differentiated responsibilities. Greece  stressed the importance of scientific data for sound climate  change policies. Costa Rica said future generations will judge the  present generation based on whether the Protocol is ratified.  Turkey announced its accession to the UNFCCC.

In the second part of the round-table, Parties discussed lessons  learned from implementation of regional and international climate  change measures. Norway observed recognition in the business and  finance communities of the move toward a carbon-constrained world.  The Maldives and Mauritius called for technology transfer to  address adaptation needs in SIDS. Colombia emphasized the role of  regional institutions and the need to strengthen regional  development banks. Sweden highlighted the value of the European  Emissions Trading Scheme. Bangladesh emphasized the need for  regional capacity-building activities. Nigeria said the SCCF  negotiations have re-opened agreements reached at previous COP  sessions.

In the third part of the round-table, Parties discussed the  assessment of progress and practical steps for future actions,  focusing in particular on cooperation and cross-sectoral  partnerships to promote action on climate change. The Philippines  said the current pace of negotiations is 'grossly inadequate.' The  Russian Federation urged clear procedures for the CDM,  operationalization of JI, and simplification of existing Protocol  procedures. Tuvalu noted that progress made so far does not  reflect the seriousness of climate change and emphasized that real  action is needed. Bhutan expressed concern that the LDC Fund will  be inaccessible to most LDCs. Oman and others urged Annex I  Parties to provide greater technical and financial assistance to  developing countries. Australia said it will strive to meet its  Protocol targets. Kiribati called for a framework that ensures  that vulnerable countries have access to financing to address the  adverse affects of climate change. Cuba noted the importance of  access to technologies and knowledge.

### STATEMENTS BY OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS

Statements by UN bodies and  specialized agencies: UNEP Executive Director Klaus Töpfer called  for financial and technical support to address this 'ethical  challenge,' which affects mostly poor people in developing  countries. José Antonio Ocampo, UN Under-Secretary-General for  Economic and Social Affairs, emphasized the role of financial  mechanisms and trade in diversifying economies. Len Good, CEO and  Chair of the GEF, announced that pilot projects on adaptation  planning and measures are a new strategic priority for the GEF,  and called for clear guidance to mobilize resources for the SCCF.

World Bank Vice-President Ian Johnson noted that both public  funding and private finance are needed to address climate change.  IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri expressed hope that participants will  find the IPCC TAR useful in their work on the UNFCCC. Hama Arba  Diallo, CCD Executive Secretary, stressed the importance of  effective implementation of the UNFCCC and CCD at the local level  to avoid duplication of work and to maximize resources. Alvaro  Silva Calderon, OPEC Executive Secretary, said that the concerns  of OPEC countries over adverse effects continue to be inadequately  addressed. Kiyotaka Akasaka, OECD Deputy Secretary-General, said  OECD works with its member States to strengthen the use of  market-based mechanisms to limit climate change while contributing  to sustainable economic development.

G.O.P. Obasi, WMO Secretary-General, said 2003 will be the second  warmest year on record, and emphasized that the WMO will continue  to mobilize efforts to strengthen observation networks.

###     Statements by intergovernmental organizations

The World Council of Churches said environmental  degradation is a matter of justice and spirituality, and stressed  that reducing emissions should be a moral goal.

# CLOSING PLENARY

Rapporteur Gonzalo Menéndez (Panama) introduced the report of  COP-9 on Friday, 12 December, which the COP adopted  (FCCC/CP/2003/L.1 and Add.1).

Cuba requested that its concerns over being denied visas to attend  the GEF Council meetings, despite being the Caribbean  countries'representative on the Council, be noted in the COP-9  report. The G-77/China read a statement urging the GEF Secretariat  to take the necessary action with the World Bank and host  government to grant the representative of the Caribbean  constituency a visa to attend the GEF Council meetings. The  G-77/China also urged the GEF Secretariat and other international  organizations to take the necessary action and make arrangement  with host governments and relevant agencies to guarantee the  representation of all Parties at relevant meetings. President  Persányi said the request would be noted in the COP-9 Report.

The Russian Federation questioned when preparatory work to  facilitate the implementation of projects under Protocol Article 6  (joint implementation) would be undertaken. The Executive  Secretary responded that this would be done by the Secretariat in  2004-5, subject to the availability of resources from  extra-budgetary resources which will be activated in 2005 upon  entry into force of the Protocol.

Argentina introduced an expression of gratitude to the Government  of Italy and the people of the city of Milan, which the COP  adopted (FCCC/CP/2003/L.6).

In closing, the G-77/China said the achievements made at COP-9  provided hope for the future. He noted decisions on sinks in the  CDM and the SCCF, as well as the report of the CDM EB as important  outcomes, and stressed the need for Annex I Parties to implement  their commitments under the UNFCCC. Japan and Australia, for the  Umbrella Group, also noted the important nature of the COP-9  outcomes.

President Persányi said the results of the COP would not generate  breaking news, but stressed that cooperation in building and  reinforcing the UNFCCC had been shown, comparing it to the  building of the Milan cathedral. Thanking participants and the  Secretariat, he closed COP-9 at 6:47 pm.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF COP-9 THE TWO FACES OF THE UNFCCC

Two sides of the UNFCCC, two 'faces,' were clearly visible at  COP-9. The first face was that of the ongoing negotiations aimed at  strengthening and building on the original treaty and bringing the  Kyoto Protocol to fruition. While these official negotiations  enjoyed some progress at COP-9, including an agreement on the use  of sinks in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), this side of  the meeting could hardly be seen as an overwhelming success. While  the official intergovernmental negotiations seemed beset by  inertia and a lack of leadership, the COP-9 corridors were buzzing  with what some saw as the second 'face' of the meeting; the  'implementing face.' This side of COP-9 was reflected in the  workshops and other side events that showed the vision and  enthusiasm being demonstrated for the Convention by its observer  constituencies: environmental NGOs, business and industry groups,  local governments, indigenous peoples organizations, and research  and independent NGOs (RINGOs). It is these constituencies who  continue to prove that, regardless of some Parties' apparent  reluctance to make significant progress, vigorous efforts to  address the adverse effects of climate change are already underway,  and are gaining momentum. This analysis provides an insight into  these two different 'faces' of the UNFCCC process.

# THE NEGOTIATORS' FACE

### THE 'FOREST COP'

While COP-8 is already referred to be some as  the 'adaptation COP' due to the progress made on adaptation issues,  for similar reasons negotiators may one day reminisce that COP-9  was the 'forest COP.' Ever since COP-4 in 1998, the issue of sinks  in the CDM has been plagued by complex and time-consuming  discussions and often diametrically opposed negotiating positions.  The long period of sessional and inter-sessional consultations,  which forged good relationships among negotiators and allowed  Parties to understand each other's concerns, was the basis for a  much more cordial atmosphere at COP-9.

Essentially, the debate could be viewed as one between buyers and  sellers of carbon sequestration credits. The buyers, including the  EU, Norway and Switzerland, were mostly concerned about the  quality of the product and sought conditions that would protect  their investments and maintain credibility with environmental NGOs.  Some insisted on rigorous criteria for socioeconomic and  environmental impacts, non-permanence and leakage. The sellers,  including Bolivia, Colombia, and other Latin American countries,  on the other hand, strove for favorable market conditions, aimed  at avoiding 'crippling' transaction costs. They sought more  flexible crediting periods, an insurance approach to credits that  would add value to what otherwise appears as a mere 'rent' of  emissions reductions, and environmental and social impact  assessments that are not excessively strict and costly.

After years of negotiations, a compromise package was agreed,  which in the words of one observer was 'masterfully crafted' by  Co-Chairs Thelma Krug and Karsten Sach. While the value of the  compromise still needs to be tested, for now, all Parties agree  that the only way forward is learning by doing.

###     The negotiations direction: backward, sideways or forward?

Irrespective of the results achieved in the discussions on sinks  in the CDM, there was undoubtedly a sense of treading the same  waters, if not of pedaling backwards on a range of other issues  considered by the SBSTA and SBI. These included negotiations on  the IPCC's Third Assessment Report (TAR) and on non-Annex I  national communications.

The limited progress in the TAR negotiations becomes evident as  soon as one recalls that it was the First Assessment Report (FAR)  that led to the negotiation of the UNFCCC itself, while the Second  Assessment Report (SAR) helped trigger negotiation of the Kyoto  Protocol. In contrast, nearly three years after the TAR's  completion, and following two years of negotiations in SBSTA and  COP sessions, delegates only just agreed not to preclude  substantive discussion of the TAR under the new agenda items on  adaptation and mitigation established to this end. The  G-77/China's strong resistance to adopting a COP decision on the  TAR, and in fact to discussing anything beyond procedures for  further consideration of this issue, is a clear reflection of the  group's determination not to allow negotiations to head anywhere  close to the issue of developing countries' future commitments.  After all, the new mitigation agenda item will be the main place  where this could be addressed. With frustration over Annex I  Parties' failures to fulfill their commitments, limited transfer  of technologies and insufficient financial support, developing  countries held firmly to preventing negotiations turning towards  mitigation activities by non-Annex I countries in the future.

On the other hand, some observers commented with surprise on the  G-77/China's prohibitive stance to advancing substantive  consideration of the IPCC TAR, as this not only limits work on  mitigation, but also on adaptation, a major concern to a large,  although not necessarily very powerful, faction of the G-77/China  group. Given this shortfall on focusing on substantive discussions,  it is unlikely that the TAR will, unlike the SAR and FAR,  significantly shape future UNFCCC negotiations. Nevertheless, the  window of opportunity for considering the substance of the third,  and possibly future, IPCC assessment reports has been created.

On non-Annex I national communications, it would be a stretch to  say that great advances have been made. In fact, the general  perception seemed to be that Parties had taken a step back in at  least one sense: whereas at SBSTA-18, delegates agreed to 'urge'  Parties that have not yet done so to submit their national  communications as soon as possible, this time around, the  compromise language ended-up only 'encouraging' Parties to do so  as soon as possible. Furthermore, lengthy negotiations at COP-8 on  revised guidelines for preparing national communications returned  to haunt negotiators as developing countries sought to weaken any  additional commitments on reporting due to a realization that  funding would be insufficient to cover this work.

This, and the G-77/China's unwavering opposition to refer to the  frequency of submissions, was seen by some as yet another  illustration of developing countries' unwillingness to move ahead  on anything other than the obligations of the developed countries.  As for Parties' inability to reach agreement on the submission of  future national communications, this is on the one hand a  reflection of what some saw as the G-77/China's current 'mantra'  to avoid indications of future commitments on their part. One the  other hand, it illustrates the incoherence between the EU's  negotiating mandate, pushing for a decision on this issue, and its  determination to carry this through. Despite many EU Member  States' emphasis on the importance of this issue, it remained  unclear to observers, save for incredulous miscommunication or a  hidden agenda, why this issue was given up by the EU without any  resistance.

On the other hand, outside the box of defensive party positions  and regime-focused strategic approaches held in the negotiations,  the high-level round-table discussions among ministers provided a  refreshing change of pace, allowing an opportunity to step back  and take a wider perspective on the UNFCCC process and the issue  of climate change itself. Unleashed from common denominator group  positions and the confines of negotiations, ministers were forced,  within strict time limits, to get to the point and present the  issues, which they believe are most pertinent in the broader  context of climate change. While many of the issues raised by  ministers, such as sustainable development, adaptation and  technology transfer are not new, they clearly needed political  reinforcement. Statements by several countries on their Kyoto  targets and future actions may also provide a better insight into  the non-negotiated COP outcomes: ministers and senior officials  from Canada, the Netherlands and Australia confirmed their intent  to meet their Kyoto targets, even if the Protocol does not enter  into force, and Germany, the UK, Philippines and Micronesia  supported action on keeping the temperature increase below two  degrees Celsius within this century. Re-awakening ministers to the  needs to engage, mainstream and prioritize these broader issues  may be one of the more significant, non-negotiated outcomes of the  COP.

# THE CONSTITUENCY FACE

While the official negotiations were taking place, the UNFCCC's  'second face' was also highly visible at COP-9. The Milan COP  demonstrated that climate change issues remain high on the  political agendas of many NGOs, business groups and the academic  community, regardless of what is taking place in the latest round  of intergovernmental negotiations. While diplomats were often left  agreeing on the lowest common denominator, more than one hundred  side events also took place Milan, almost all of which were  focused on the highest common denominator: achieving the concrete  and necessary steps to meet the UNFCCC's ultimate objective. To  many attending COP-9, the attention and interest generated in  these debates overshadowed the impasse and unwillingness of some  Parties to engage in substantive negotiations on progress or lack  thereof. The side events often stressed the various paths on  which negotiators seemed 'afraid to travel,' - again highlighting  the somewhat contradictory nature of the two faces of the UNFCCC  most visible at COP-9.

First, a large majority of side events focused on 'future actions'  and 'post first commitment period thinking.' This contrasted  sharply with the official negotiations, where the issue of the  second review of the adequacy of commitment was held in abeyance  for the fifth COP running. The last day of COP-9 saw an informal  discussion between environmental NGOs and some Annex I and  non-Annex I Parties to discuss the urgency of defining future  actions.

Secondly, while negotiations on national communications were  continuously 'blocked' over concerns that the submission of  information on inventories and P&Ms will lead to 'new  obligations,' the constituencies active in the side events have  already built and solidified the foundations for the successful  sharing of experiences, capacity and lessons learned, clearly  demonstrating the value and contribution of such information in  shaping debates on mainstreaming climate change, adaptation, local  action and innovative projects. COP-9 also saw the official  recognition of the RINGOs constituency, first created in COP-8,  who took its place alongside other recognized observer  constituencies. RINGOs form an important new constituency of  organizations engaged in independent research and analysis, and  their inclusion as a key constituency will inevitably strengthen  the research elements of the climate process.

# THE ONLY SHOW IN TOWN

While COP-9 had a rocky start, it ended on a positive note.  Calling the Protocol 'an unrealistic and ever-increasing  regulatory straitjacket,' US Under-Secretary of State for Global  Affairs Paula Dobriansky had written in a major financial  newspaper that the 'only acceptable, cost-effective option' to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions was the American way. This  viewpoint was argued vigorously (albeit unconvincingly, according  to most observers), by the 60-strong US delegation in Milan. Days  later, an advisor in the Russian presidency, 'thought out loud'  that Russian ratification was unlikely. Nevertheless, these  statements did not detract Parties from keeping the process on  track. In fact, the overwhelming message from the high-level  segment was that the Protocol is the 'only show in town.' COP-9 not only highlighted the division between developed and  developing countries, but also the leadership and initiative gaps  between negotiators and constituency groups. While resolving  differences on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis remains complex, the  significant number of side events signals a change towards a more  positive outlook for future COP sessions. In that sense the major  outcome of COP-9 is a renewed emphasis on the role of the UNFCCC's  constituencies as an important component of the process to deliver  an equitable global climate change regime, a point clearly made by  their demands for strong climate action, dedicated leadership,  information sharing and future thinking.
