# SBI

SBI Chair Thomas Becker (Denmark) opened the meeting on Thursday  evening, indicating that he wanted to conclude agreement on all  outstanding issues.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

On the Submission of second and, where  appropriate, third national communications from Parties not  included in Annex I to the Convention (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.9), the  Co-Chairs of the informal consultations, Soobaraj Nayroo Sok  Appadu (Mauritius) and Anders Turesson (Sweden), reported  agreement. SBI adopted the conclusions and forwarded the draft  decision to COP 11. SBI also adopted conclusions on the Work of  the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from  non-Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.11); a compilation and  synthesis of initial national communications (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.8),  and provision of financial and technical support  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.7).

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Karsten Sach  (Germany) reported on contact group discussions and introduced  draft conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.4), which addressed  arrangements for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, future sessional periods,  organization of the intergovernmental process, and observer  organizations in the Convention process. On future sessional  periods, he noted text accepting a request by the IPCC to postpone  COP 13 by four weeks, and said he believed Parties could now  accept this. On the intergovernmental process, he noted agreement  to 'further explore possible options for improvement.' Noting  complaints about the multiple contact groups and heavy agenda, he  urged Parties to reflect on possible solutions prior to  COP 11 /MOP 1, observing that 'we don't want to learn this lesson  the hard way.' SBI adopted the conclusions.

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND (SCCF)

Contact group Co-Chairs Emily  Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) and Jozef Buys (Belgium) reported that,  despite some progress, delegates had been unable to reach  agreement. SBI forwarded the conclusions as presented  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.13), which contained a number of brackets. SBI  Chair Becker urged delegates to arrive at COP 11 with more  flexible mandates to allow for an agreement. The EU reiterated  support for the SCCF, noted that the EU has already pledged US$35  million, and said he will work with the GEF to ensure the SCCF is  implemented properly.

### OTHER MATTERS

Level of Emissions for the Base Year of Croatia:  Jim Penman (UK) reported that informal consultations had resulted  in agreement on this matter (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.3). Chair Becker  thanked Jim Penman for his work in resolving this longstanding  issue. SBI agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP.

###     Climate Neutral UNFCCC Meetings

Chair Becker explained that he  had consulted informally and prepared draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.12). The short text was adopted by SBI without  comment.

###     Issues Relating to the Implementation of Decision 1/CP.10

Chair  Becker also noted that three submissions had been made at SB 22 on  Decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and  Response Measures). These were contained in a document  (FCCC/SBI/2005/Misc.2) that will be referenced in the final report  of SBI 22, under the item, 'Any Other Matters.'

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Budget Performance for the  Biennium 2004-2005: SBI adopted conclusions on this sub-item  (FCC/SBI/2005/L.5).

Implementation of Paragraph 7(c) of the Financial Procedures of  the Convention Concerning Financial Support for Participation in  the UNFCCC Process: SBI adopted conclusions on this sub-item  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.10) following textual amendments proposed by  Australia.

###     Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement

SBI adopted  conclusions on this issue without comment (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.2).

###     Internal Review of the Activities of the Secretariat

Chair Becker  noted that a contact group had developed draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.6 and L.6/Add.1). SBI adopted the conclusions.

Chair Becker also reported on a meeting involving Chairs of the  SBs and UNFCCC expert groups on cooperative activities, noting  that a joint meeting on adaptation was being considered.

### MATTERS RELATING TO THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

Following  lengthy negotiations throughout the day (see the 'Contact Groups  and Informal Consultations' section, below), SBI adopted the  conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.14) and agreed to recommend the draft  decision to COP 11 (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.14/Add.1). Bangladesh, for the  LDCs, noted that the final text was not LDCs' preferred outcome,  but that they had compromised. He said it is now up to the GEF to  operationalize the guidance in a way that truly responds to the  need to implement the NAPAs.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2006-2007

At 12:35 am Friday  morning, Chair Becker announced that a final agreement on the  budget for 2006-2007 had still not been reached. He therefore  suspended the meeting until 10:30 am.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### IPCC REPORT ON SAFEGUARDING THE OZONE LAYER AND GLOBAL CLIMATE  SYSTEM

At a SBSTA contact group held in the morning, delegates  agreed on the draft conclusions presented by Chair Goetze, which  will be forwarded to SBSTA for adoption. The final text includes  text on measurement and systematic observation, and two paragraphs  setting out a process for considering the issue, including a  request for submissions by 13 February 2006. The text also  suggests that SB 24 finalize consideration of this agenda item.

### ADAPTATION

Delegates met Thursday morning for ongoing  consultations on the SBSTA programme of work on impacts,  vulnerability and adaptation to climate change, and in the  afternoon and evening to consider draft SBSTA conclusions and a  draft COP decision. On objectives of the work programme, Samoa, on  behalf of the G-77/CHINA, supported by JAPAN and opposed by the  US, proposed text including reference to the most vulnerable and  to Decision 1/CP.10. SWITZERLAND, with NORWAY, called instead for  specific reference to SBSTA's work under Decision 1/CP.10. The US,  opposed by the EU, suggested referring to climate risks, impacts  and vulnerability instead of to climate change. SAUDI ARABIA  called for reference to response measures. SBSTA Chair Benrageb  offered to conduct an informal workshop before SB 23 to facilitate  the development of the work programme. Delegates accepted his  offer and agreed to the draft conclusions, which will be forwarded  to SBSTA.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

After lengthy negotiations throughout the day  and into the evening, delegates reached agreement on the terms of  reference for the EGTT and on draft conclusions. Agreement on the  EGTT terms of reference was reached at midday, after differences  over long-term strategies and review of progress were resolved.  Paragraph-by-paragraph discussions continued throughout the day  over draft conclusions, on paragraphs referencing adaptation  technology, technologies to be addressed by EGTT and technology  needs assessments, joint research, and public domain and publicly  owned technologies. The last obstacle to agreement, a reference to  Decision 4/CP.4 paragraph 7(b) (publicly-owned environmentally  sound technologies), was finally resolved in the evening. A  contact group was convened to formalize agreements, which were  forwarded to SBSTA for consideration.

### MITIGATION

Delegates consulted informally and in a contact group  to continue discussions on an appropriate forum for parties to  present their views on lessons learned from the mitigation  workshops and future steps under this agenda item. No progress was  made, with the EU and CANADA proposing to have such a forum,  opposed by G-77/CHINA, the US, and AUSTRALIA. After lengthy  discussions, delegates accepted a proposal by SAUDI ARABIA,  seconded by the US, to remove reference to a forum. Draft SBSTA  conclusions containing three paragraphs were agreed and forwarded  to SBSTA for consideration. These acknowledge Party submissions,  welcome the in-session workshop, take note of the Chair's summary,  and request the Secretariat to prepare a concise report on the  topics presented at the in-session workshop.

### EMISSIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL AVIATION AND MARITIME TRANSPORT

Informal consultations on this issue focused on whether to set out  a process, which the EU and others supported, but SAUDI ARABIA and  a number of other developing countries opposed.

### SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES (SIDS)

Delegates were unable to  agree on text on this matter during consultations held earlier in  the day. Compromise text apparently aimed at accommodating  requests by AOSIS and others for a UNFCCC follow-up on the  Mauritius Strategy, was withdrawn. In discussions convened in a  small drafting group, the US opposed suggested language on an  ongoing process, preferring shorter text taking note of the  Mauritius Strategy. AOSIS and the EU opposed a shorter text. No  resolution was reported by Thursday evening.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2006-2007

Following lengthy  informal consultations, contact group Chair John Ashe introduced  SBI draft conclusions to the contact group containing draft COP 11  decisions on the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol budgets for 2006-2007.  The EU and G-77/CHINA supported the proposed budget. However, the  US suggested reducing the Convention budget by US$2 million, while  Japan proposed reducing the overall budget by US$3 million. UNFCCC  Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter said a $2 million reduction  would 'seriously affect the operations of the Secretariat.' Noting  the lack of consensus, Chair Ashe suggested forwarding the text to  SB 23, and closed the meeting.

Informal multilateral and bilateral consultations soon resumed.  However, as of 12:30 am Friday morning, delegates had been unable  to reach a final agreement.

### MATTERS RELATING TO THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

SBI Chair  Becker chaired this contact group meeting, presented draft SBI  conclusions and COP 11/MOP 1 decisions, and proposed two  revisions: that full-cost funding from the LDC Fund shall be to  meet the 'agreed' costs of activities to adapt to the adverse  effects of climate change as identified and prioritized in the  NAPAs; and that adaptation to climate change is the reason for  such funding rather than the 'sole' reason. Uganda, for LDCs,  noted that it could agree to 'additional' instead of 'agreed,' and  proposed deleting reference to adaptation as the reason for such  funding. The EU, CANADA, and others offered support for the  Chair's proposals. Lacking agreement, the Chair adjourned the  contact group. However, informal consultations eventually produced  a compromise that includes a footnote defining 'additional costs'  and deleting the reference to adaptation to climate change as the  reason for such funding.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates seemed relieved at the completion of most of SBI's work  late on Thursday night, although not everyone was celebrating.  With agreement on the programme budget for 2006-2007 still elusive  as of 12:30 am Friday morning, some delegates left the meeting  clearly frustrated. On the other hand, celebrations at a final  agreement on a decision on LDCs appeared genuine, although  tempered by a few comments that the result was not as strong as  some would have liked. There also seemed to be real satisfaction  at the significant step towards concluding work on another  longstanding agenda item relating to Croatia's base year  emissions. However, frustrations were evident in some quarters  over the short text on several issues, such as mitigation and  climate neutral UNFCCC meetings.
