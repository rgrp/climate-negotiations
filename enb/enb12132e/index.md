# INFORMAL MEETINGS

### COMPLIANCE

On 9 June, delegates continued consideration of  the Co-Chairs' Elements of a Compliance System for the  Kyoto Protocol. On COP/MOP, Co-Chair Slade said the  proposals reflected the degree of political intervention  Parties would allow in the compliance process. NEW ZEALAND  and the EU said the COP/MOP was the central policy-making  body, but should not directly intervene in a specific case  by taking over the judicial/legal body's functions. SAUDI  ARABIA stressed the COP/MOP's central role and said it  would not only accept the report of the compliance body,  but could also modify that body's decisions. CANADA, with  NEW ZEALAND, said this would politicize the process and  that the legal appreciation should be left to the  compliance body. AUSTRALIA said the COP/MOP could have a  final say on manifestly unjust decisions.

On China's proposal to include a new section on the  implications of Article 18 (non-compliance), the US said an  amendment would be needed if binding consequences were to  be adopted as part of the compliance system. CHINA  cautioned against creating two groups of Parties that had  ratified the Protocol: one group with, and the other  without, the compliance procedure. The US said the  amendment could be addressed when commitments for the  second budget period were considered.

### GUIDELINES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Subgroup on  Article 5.1 (national systems): On 9 June, delegates worked  to remove three remaining brackets on the second draft  Guidelines for National Systems for the Estimation of  Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sources and  Removals by Sinks under Article 5.1. On Applicability,  delegates sought acceptable language on mandatory and non- mandatory provisions in the Guidelines. On the EU proposal  to insert two paragraphs on monitoring of emissions of  legal entities and/or projects under Articles 6 and 17  under national systems, delegates agreed to a compromise  proposal by CANADA for a new paragraph under  Characteristics that would refer to relevant IPCC  guidelines and COP or COP/MOP decisions. On 10 June, the  subgroup resolved all outstanding editorial issues and  approved the revised guidelines.

Subgroup on Articles 5.2 (adjustments) and 8 (review of  information): On 9 June, delegates continued consideration  of the EU proposal on Classification of Inventory Problems  in the guidelines under Article 8, focusing on  issues/problems with direct implications on the total  aggregated inventory estimate or trend. Differing views  were expressed as to whether any failure to follow the good  practice principles was adjustable. NORWAY, supported by  the EU, highlighted the linkages between the adjustment and  compliance processes. NEW ZEALAND suggested that the final  report of the expert review team should include the  rationale for the adjustment and identification of steps  the Party concerned could take in order to address the  underlying causes of the inventory problem. Co-Chair Penman  noted consensus among delegates that adjustments were 'a  good thing' and that they could be limited in two ways: as  part of the review process and, for practical reasons, in  time.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

On 9 June, delegates heard presentations  by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on the Climate  Development Initiative (CDI) and considered capacity  building in non-Annex I countries.

Avani Vaish, GEF, said the CDI is an 18-month effort by GEF  and UNDP in 3 phases: an assessment of country-level  capacity needs; preparation of a comprehensive study to  meet those needs; and development of an action plan. John  Hoff, UNDP, defined capacity development as the ability of  individuals and institutions to set and realize goals, and  said it is influenced by the broader context of the  institutions, including policy and regulatory frameworks.

Delegates heard brief reports by regional experts. Issues  raised included: lack of financial resources; inefficient  management of human resources and information; inability to  retain human capacity; and a low level of economic,  managerial and communication skills. On possible elements  for a draft framework for capacity building, several  delegates stressed the need for capacity building to be  country-driven. The G-77/CHINA stressed that capacity  building be a continuous, integrative and comprehensive  process implemented within a specific time frame and based  on country priorities. The US stressed the need to work on  in-country capacities, build strong partnerships with local  stakeholders and incorporate capacity building in national  strategies.

On the role of institutions, several delegates called for  clear guidance to the GEF to ensure adequate funding for  capacity building initiatives.

The G-77/CHINA said national communications should be the  main source of information to monitor the effectiveness of  capacity building. AOSIS drew attention to the Barbados  Programme of Action and emphasized regional efforts in  addressing capacity building needs.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

On 9 June, Chair Dovland introduced  text for possible draft SBSTA-12 conclusions and  preliminary elements of a draft decision for COP-6 based on  recent discussions and submissions by Parties. The draft  conclusions included a SBSTA recommendation that work on  sharing experiences and information continue, in particular  through a workshop in 2001. The draft decision stated,  inter alia, that this process should lead to a further  elaboration of the guidelines under Article 7.2 (national  communications) and enable a demonstration of progress by  2005, in the context of Article 3.2 (demonstrable  progress).

The EU supported moving forward by exchanging views on both  texts. Noting the lack of time to consider this matter, the  G-77/CHINA objected to consideration of elements of a draft  decision. SAUDI ARABIA added that it was premature to  consider a decision before holding another workshop  involving more developing countries, and highlighted other  pressing issues in the lead-up to COP-6. He said it would  be more appropriate to consider conclusions that expressed  appreciation for the recent workshop in Copenhagen and  called for another workshop in 2001.

Chair Dovland said SBSTA-12 would consider this issue, and  noted agreement on a workshop in 2001. AOSIS said it looked  forward to extensive discussion on this matter during  SBSTA-12.

### LULUCF

On 9 and 10 June, delegates met to consider the  IPCC Special Report on LULUCF, with the lead authors  responding to requests for clarification. On implications  of Article 3.3 (afforestation, restoration and  deforestation - ARD) and 3.4 (additional activities),  delegates considered, inter alia: ARD definitions,  accounting scenarios, and how to combine them; issues  related to separating 'human-induced' activities, 'direct  human-induced' activities, and natural variability;  improved management versus land-use change; the basis of  and need for a definition of 'forest'; the carbon  accounting schemes and their relationship to atmospheric  carbon; implications for the harvest-regeneration cycle;  carbon stock changes versus fluxes; baselines and  additionality; non-CO2 gases; incentives for sequestration  where no land-use change occurs, and for the capture of co- benefits; and the intent behind the need for each Party to  establish its level of carbon stocks in 1990 as required  under Article 3.4.

The EU suggested designing ARD definitions specifically for  the purpose of implementing Article 3.3, and the UK raised  the possibility of customizing the IPCC scenarios. CANADA  preferred land-based accounting and noted that Article 3.4  represents an opportunity to deal with sinks in a  comprehensive and symmetrical way. He advocated a combined  approach to Article 3.3 and 3.4. BOLIVIA said an  appropriate accounting scheme would also be applicable  under Articles 6 and 12. BRAZIL said the definition of a  forest for the purposes of Article 3.3 should be linked to  thresholds for the variable tonnes of carbon per hectare.  AUSTRALIA raised the issue of spatial and temporal  discontinuities under Article 3.3 and the need to avoid  perverse incentives. He called for further development of  measurement techniques for the land-use change sector,  noting the omission of this sector in the IPCC good  practice guidance.

On the way forward after SB-12, the G-77/CHINA, supported  by AOSIS, cautioned against using a 'fast track',  highlighting that he did not consider it to be part of the  BAPA.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

On 10 June, Co-Chair Salamat summarized  issues raised in submissions and called on delegates to  identify additional issues and comment on the need for and  nature of future meetings.

JAPAN underlined the importance of recognizing past support  for adaptation and, with MOZAMBIQUE, highlighted  institutional and managerial capacity building, and  training for vulnerability assessments and response  measures. The EU highlighted monitoring and research, the  importance of dialogue between donors and recipients and,  with the NETHERLANDS, providing for adaptation within  national and sectoral strategies. The UK and US emphasized  the identification and evaluation of adaptation options.  SAUDI ARABIA and the US, opposed by SWITZERLAND,  highlighted provision for CO2 sequestration technologies.  AUSTRALIA underlined the role of sinks. BELIZE called for  immediate adaptation measures. BRAZIL, with JAMAICA,  underscored the role of regional climate change models.  NIGERIA emphasized access to information technology,  including telecommunications.

On future meetings, AOSIS emphasized the value of regional  workshops and the need for coordination of FCCC workshops  and meetings. SENEGAL proposed a workshop on least  developed countries. ZIMABABWE proposed a workshop to  examine the role of insurance. JAPAN highlighted resource  constraints for intersessional meetings. SAUDI ARABIA  proposed a workshop on the nature and implication of Annex  I Parties' P&Ms, as well as one on Protocol Article 3.14.  SWITZERLAND, JAPAN and others said the issue of workshops  would be addressed during SB-12.

The G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, SOUTH AFRICA and  others, and opposed by SWITZERLAND, expressed preference  for separate draft decisions, one on FCCC Article 4.8 and  4.9, and another on Protocol Article 3.14. Co-Chair Salamat  noted that the draft decision will have three distinct  parts without prejudice to SBSTA-12 discussions.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While most participants left the week of informal meetings  with the feeling that they had successfully moved  discussions forward on several key issues, some sessions  ended on a slightly sour note. Attempts by some Chairs to  present draft decisions or negotiating text met with  confusion over the extent of the meetings' mandate, and  sparked what some observers saw as political posturing that  contrasted with the generally constructive and open  dialogue. While there was agreement on developing  consolidated text for mechanisms and adverse effects, EU  delegates were disappointed when attempts to develop a  negotiating text on policies and measures for a decision at  COP-6 were stonewalled by some G-77 countries late Friday  afternoon.
