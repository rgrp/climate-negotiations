abstract: "Delegates to COP-10 held final contact group meetings on Tuesday  morning and afternoon, convening in evening and night SBSTA and  SBI meetings to complete their work and adopt conclusions and  approve draft decisions to be forwarded to the COP. Numerous draft  decisions contain brackets and were forwarded to the COP  Presidency for further consultations. Contact groups addressed  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation to  climate change (mitigation), capacity building, technology  transfer, matters relating to least developed countries (LDCs),  progress on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 (adverse  effects), and the UNFCCC's financial mechanism."

# CONTACT GROUPS

### MITIGATION

The EU reiterated preference to request the Secretariat  to compile submissions from Parties on lessons learned from  mitigation workshops held to date and future steps under this  agenda item, to facilitate ongoing consideration of this agenda  item 'and elements of a future work programme' at SBSTA-23. The  G-77/CHINA, with the US and others, opposed reference to a future  work programme. Delegates agreed to forward the bracketed text to  SBSTA.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates addressed draft conclusions and a  draft decision. Discussions resumed on the issue of the framework  for effective and meaningful actions to enhance implementation of  UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology transfer). Delegates could not  agree on whether reference to the COP-8 Delhi Declaration on  Climate Change and Sustainable Development should be included in  the preamble of the draft decision. The draft conclusions and  bracketed draft decision were forwarded to SBSTA.

### LDCS

Co-Chairs Bubu Jallow and Ricardo Moita introduced a draft  decision and draft conclusions. Discussions were held on, inter  alia, whether the LDC Fund should begin funding national  adaptation programmes of action (NAPA) priority areas, and whether  the LDC Fund should leverage additional resources, provide  co-financing and build upon existing plans and programmes.  Agreement could not be reached on all issues, and delegates agreed  to forward the bracketed conclusions and bracketed draft decision  to SBI.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Co-Chair Jukka Uosukainen (Finland) said many  paragraphs in the draft decisions remain bracketed. On text  concerning integration and mainstreaming in planning processes,  the G-77/CHINA preferred to bracket the reference to mainstreaming.  Parties agreed to forward the draft decision on capacity building  in countries with economies in transition, and the bracketed draft  decision on capacity building in developing countries to SBI.

### ADAPTATION

David Warrilow (UK) said the contact group had been  unable to resolve all outstanding issues. SAUDI ARABIA and the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION opposed the proposed draft conclusions, arguing  that these did not reflect their respective proposals to the  contact group. Following discussions and informal consultations,  Parties agreed to amend the draft conclusions, adding brackets and  noting that concerns of some Parties have not been considered in  the draft conclusions. SBSTA forwarded the draft conclusions to  the COP Presidency (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.31).

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As described by one observer, Tuesday was clearly the 'day of the  brackets' with numerous bracketed draft decisions left unfinished  and being forwarded by SBSTA and SBI directly to the COP  Presidency that has already begun informal senior-level  discussions. Exhausted delegates in the corridors remarked upon  the unusual approach taken by the SBI and SBSTA, in limiting  strictly the time allowed for discussion on issues that were near  completion. In particular, observers pointed out that the issues  of the financial mechanism and the LDCs could have completed their  work, noting that with three days to go, sufficient time could  have been found.

Delegates also expressed their disappointment at the renegotiation  of terms of the LDC Fund, meaning that progress made at COP-9 on  funding for adaptation is essentially negligible. Meanwhile,  closure of SBSTA was held up for hours by insistence by the  Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia that their proposals on  adaptation be reflected in the draft conclusions, generating  speculation about the motivation for the Russian objection.
