# ADDITIONAL HUMAN-INDUCED ACTIVITIES UNDER ARTICLE 3.4

### IPCC OVERVIEW

Presentations: IPCC Chair Bob Watson  outlined key elements requiring decisions relating to  Article 3.4 (additional activities), including which  activities to include, if any, and whether a Party that  chooses to report activities in the first commitment period  should be obliged to report on the entire set of selected  activities. He then identified several key issues under  Article 3.4, including: whether to adopt a broad or narrow  definition of an activity; how much land will need to be  monitored, including cost and potential windfall  considerations; how to address the issue of baselines; what  ancillary benefits exist; and how to resolve permanence  issues.

Ian Noble, IPCC Lead Author, Australian National  University, outlined options for the definition of an  activity. He said a broad definition of an activity would  provide a more simplistic approach covering all practices  on an area of land, while a narrow definition - based on  individual practices - would permit greater accuracy. He  suggested that a broad definition would be more compatible  with land-based accounting, while a narrow definition would  better suit activity-based accounting, although any  combination could be made to work. He then discussed  'scientific baselines,' noting the need to account for the  human-induced element. He concluded by elaborating  opportunities or 'potentials' under Article 3.4,  identifying groups of activities relating to improved  management and land-use change. He said estimates suggested  that forest, cropland and grazing management could have  significant benefits for Annex I Parties, while  transforming degraded agricultural land to agroforestry  could particularly benefit non-Annex I Parties.

Question-and-answer session: In the subsequent question- and-answer session on the IPCC overview, AOSIS queried  whether identifying specific 'potentials' was appropriate  at this stage. The UK noted that the scientific baseline  was not a baseline as it is regularly understood. He  stressed the importance of separating human-induced effects  under Article 3.4. Replying to concerns raised by CHINA  over conflicting land-use priorities, Ian Noble said  changes from current agricultural practices to agroforestry  should be carefully designed to ensure overall benefits to  the population, and said agroforestry should not be  practiced on prime agricultural land. AUSTRALIA supported  further discussion on frameworks and measurements.

On questions relating to monitoring and verification, Noble  acknowledged the high costs involved, and raised the need  for a discussion on cost and benefits. On verification, he  commented that there should be mechanisms in place, such as  spot checks and checking of documentary evidence, coupled  with indirect verification through scientific papers.

On carbon crediting, the EUROPEAN COMMISSION highlighted  social and environmental baselines, emphasizing the  Protocol's sustainable development goals.

### PRESENTATIONS

Following the IPCC overview and question- and-answer session, participants heard presentations from  representatives of five Parties and one NGO on additional  human-induced activities under Article 3.4.

Party presentations: David Boulter, Senior Climate Change  Advisor, Canada Forest Service, provided a national  perspective of forest management under the Protocol,  suggesting that sustainable forest management would be a  cost-effective sink opportunity for Parties to fulfill  their emissions targets, and should be included under  Article 3.4.

Andres Arnalds, Deputy Director, Iceland's Soil  Conservation Service, presented on carbon sequestration by  revegetation. Emphasizing that degradation is a global  phenomenon, he underscored the importance of incentives to  local farming communities and highlighted the multiple  benefits of revegetation, including wide ranging socio- economic benefits and the encouragement of non-forest  species.

Adele Morris, Special Advisor, US State Department,  presented a national perspective on the LULUCF long-term  approach and phase-in for the first commitment period. She  suggested LULUCF objectives should include: linking Article  3.3 as a package with Article 3.4; incorporating a long- term system; assisting Parties to meet Kyoto targets cost- effectively; and considering a phase-in approach to address  first commitment period issues. She proposed moving toward  a system of complete greenhouse gas accounting on all  managed lands and emphasized that Article 3.4 activities  should be broadly defined and take a comprehensive  approach. She suggested a phase-in option to full  accounting for the first commitment period, including:  adjusting assigned amounts by including only net removals  over a certain threshold; and applying a discount rate. She  recommended consideration of incentives and ancillary  environmental effects in domestic implementation and land  conversion accounting.

Konrad Tomaszewski, General Director of State Forests for  Poland, discussed the role of the state's involvement in  and ownership of forested areas in addressing climate  change concerns. He outlined Poland's forestry management  legislation, principles and activities. He concluded that  government involvement in forest management has played a  significant role in enhancing carbon storage, such as  through development of an effective forest fire protection  system and strong afforestation programme.

Lorenzo Ciccarese, Senior Researcher on Climate and  Forestry for Italy's National Environmental Protection  Agency, made a presentation on Italy's national experience  relevant to Article 3.4, including identification and  estimation of relevant changes in the carbon budget. He  described work on estimating changes in carbon storage, and  outlined relevant policies, including: emissions avoidance  activities; soil carbon conservation; forest conservation;  and forest management and silviculture techniques.

NGO presentation: Stephan Singer, Head of WWF's European  Climate and Energy Policy Office, made a presentation on  Article 3.4 activities and repercussions on the integrity  of the Protocol. He said Parties should agree to: prohibit  projects and credits without agreed inventories and  independent monitoring; address leakage and permanence  concerns; and exclude commercial forestry and business-as- usual projects. He expressed concern that industrialized  countries might attempt to negotiate an agreement at COP-6  that would effectively allow CO2 emissions to increase by  25-50%. He drew attention to a report on technical and  additional potentials for activities under Article 3.4  relating to cropland, rangeland and forest management  sequestration, which concluded that Article 3.4 activities  could create significant new entitlements for countries  with large landmasses, as well as the potential for serious  loopholes.

Question-and-answer session: In the ensuing question-and- answer session, a number of participants asked Adele Morris  for additional information on the US position. On  thresholds, Morris said an option for the phase-in proposal  during the first commitment period was to adjust assigned  amounts by including only net removals over a set  threshold. She suggested that this threshold could vary by  Party to fit their specific circumstances. In response to  questions from JAPAN and FRANCE on the idea of discount  rates, Morris said this related to the phase-in proposal,  and would involve straightforward percentage discounts for  particular accounts - for instance, forest management  accounts - before adjusting assigned amounts. AOSIS  expressed concern over the degree to which the US position  was additional to the business-as-usual scenario.

Several questions were asked relating to the WWF's  presentation. In response to a query relating to sinks and  the CDM, Stephan Singer said a key concern was that  domestic action should not be undermined as the primary  tool in meeting Protocol commitments.

### DISCUSSION

Following these presentations and question-and- answer sessions, delegates discussed key issues relating to  Article 3.4. On activities under Article 3.4, POLAND said a  wide range of activities should be promoted through the  framework of sustainable forest management. FINLAND  emphasized the role of biofuels, and called for national  circumstances to be considered when deciding on additional  activities. CANADA supported the inclusion of cropland and  grassland management and agro-forestry. UGANDA stressed  that credits not be awarded for business-as-usual.

On the timing of including activities, GERMANY, supported  by the NETHERLANDS, underscored concerns regarding the  scale, uncertainty and risks related to sinks, and  highlighted that activities not be included under Article  3.4 during the first commitment period unless these  concerns can be addressed. He suggested a pilot project  period for activities under Article 3.4 to gain a better  understanding of them. AOSIS recommended Article 3.3 as a  key pilot phase in the first commitment period.

On accounting approaches, NORWAY supported full carbon  accounting, including soil carbon and non-CO2 greenhouse  gases in the long term. The NETHERLANDS agreed, but called  for careful consideration of implications in the short  term. CANADA and JAPAN supported a broad land-based  approach. AUSTRALIA said its aim was to continue working on  an overall framework approach to accounting, expanding  across Article 3.3 and 3.4.

On wood products, CANADA and FRANCE drew attention to  opportunities relating to construction products. FINLAND  noted the environmental soundness of wood products, while  observing that discussion on their inclusion is scheduled  for 2001.

The US NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGULATORY UTILITY  COMMISSIONERS supported FAO-based definitions and an  accounting framework that reflects land-based human  activities.

IPCC Chair Bob Watson summarized key issues emerging from  discussions, which he said included: links between Article  3.3 and 3.4 due to the recognition among participants of  the difficulty of including aggradation/degradation and the  harvest-regeneration cycle under Article 3.3; the  possibility of using a single threshold that could vary  between countries and biomes; the potential role of wood  products under either Article 3.3 or 3.4; recognition that  the magnitude of a windfall would be very high compared  with sequestration achieved through management practices  under Article 3.4; and an interest in associating  sustainable forest management with carbon enhancement.

# PROJECT-BASED ACTIVITIES

### PRESENTATIONS

Party presentations: Joy Grant, Executive  Director, Programme for Belize, spoke on the Rio Bravo  Carbon Sequestration Project. She outlined the project's  history and objectives, including: conservation;  sustainable forestry; and sustainable development. She  highlighted the amount of carbon sequestered and outlined  the community benefits. Tahoun Salah, Land Resources  Advisor, Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency, spoke on  afforestation in Egypt. He highlighted the important  commonalities for forestry between the FCCC, CCD and CBD,  and called for overlaps between these conventions to be  taken into account.

Alimin Djisbar, National Technical Expert for Forestry,  Indonesia, presented on the afforestation of degraded land  in Jambi Province, Sumatra. He spoke about degraded  grasslands and the multipurpose use of various tree  species. René Yvon Brancart, President of Côte d'Ivoire's  National Committee on Climate Change, made a presentation  on the development and condition of forests in Côte  d'Ivoire. He highlighted the significance of forests for  rural livelihoods, particularly in meeting energy needs.

Jesada Luangjame, Researcher, Forest Research Office, Thai  Royal Forest Department, spoke on the status of forests and  reforestation in Thailand. Highlighting increases in  protected areas and reforestation, he said Thailand is  striving to manage forests in a sustainable manner with a  view to CO2 benefits.

NGO and industry presentations: Mika Coda, Vice President  of the Nature Conservancy's Climate Change Programme,  speaking on behalf of the Climate Action Network-US,  supported inclusion of forest conservation under the CDM,  as deforestation is a significant source of emissions, and  projects can provide co-benefits. Outlining proposed rules,  he said possible projects are too few to threaten the  integrity of the Protocol targets.

John Kinsman, Manager of Atmospheric Science for Edison  Electric Institute, and Gary Kaster, Chair of the Utilitree  Carbon Company, outlined US electric utility views on  forestry projects. Kinsman provided an overview of  experience in forestry-related projects, including issues  related to permanence and leakage. Kaster called for, inter  alia: a comprehensive full carbon accounting system  addressing all significant sources and sinks; and forestry  projects to be included under the CDM Jacob Olander, Fundacion Natura, spoke about the  contribution of LULUCF projects under the CDM. Addressing  concerns about the CDM, he stressed the need for rules and  criteria for all types of projects. He highlighted the  importance of, inter alia, full and adequate measurement  and monitoring of greenhouse gas impacts; strategies to  address underlying causes of deforestation and degradation;  and mechanisms for avoiding negative impacts and  guaranteeing adequate stakeholder participation.
