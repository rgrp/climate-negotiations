# NEGOTIATING GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### MECHANISMS

Delegates met in morning and afternoon sessions of the  mechanisms negotiating group to consider remaining issues relating  to Protocol Articles 12 (CDM), 6 (joint implementation), 17  (emissions trading) and 7.4 (assigned amounts).

On the designated operational entities of the CDM, Parties  approved the Co-Chairs' revised COP draft decision whereby host  Parties, before the submission of a validation report to the  Executive Board, should provide written support that projects  fulfill host country sustainable development objectives. BRAZIL,  with CHINA and SAMOA, urged reference to a formal letter of  agreement. On alternate members to the Executive Board, Parties  expressed divergent views on members' roles and responsibilities.  The matter was referred to informal consultations.

Revisiting SAMOA's proposal for the consideration of stakeholders  in the Executive Board's project reviews, CANADA and JAPAN,  opposed by the EU and SWITZERLAND, proposed that it be the Board's  responsibility to elaborate procedures for triggering reviews.  NORWAY called for further consultations. On the election of the  Board, SAMOA, with the EU and BULGARIA, called for consideration  of gender balance.

On guidelines for implementation of Article 6, SAMOA and the G-77/CHINA expressed concern with the early start of projects and  their eligibility for ERUs as of 2008. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION and  EU said the decision was in line with the Protocol provisions. The  issue was forwarded to informal consultations. On administrative  costs of Article 6 activities, the EU opposed SAMOA's proposal  that procedural costs be considered prior to the establishment of  the JI Supervisory Committee. The discussion was referred to  informal consultations.

On Article 17, Parties failed to reach agreement on several  elements relating to the commitment period reserve, including  whether to consider ERUs and CERs for the first commitment period.  Delegates agreed to revisit the draft decisions pending  deliberations on Article 7.4. AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA said  that Parties, upon establishment of their assigned amount and  until expiration of the additional period for fulfilling  commitments, 'should' not make a transfer resulting in these  holdings falling below the required commitment period reserve  level. The EU, G-77/CHINA, SAMOA and SWITZERLAND supported the use  of 'shall.' SWITZERLAND noted the need for mandatory requirements  to maintain the integrity of the Bonn Agreements. The issue was  forwarded to ministers. On the actions to be taken if calculations  raise a Party's 'required' level of commitment period reserve  above the Party's holdings of ERUs, CERs and AAUs, AUSTRALIA and  CANADA supported reference to 'recommended' level. Co-Chair Chow,  supported by the EU and G-77/CHINA, urged reference to 'required.'  The issue was forwarded to ministers, noting that Co-Chair Chow's  proposal enjoyed majority support.

On the draft COP decision on Article 17, AUSTRALIA, opposed by the  G-77/CHINA, SAMOA and the EU, proposed deleting the recommendation  that COP/MOP-1 adopt the decision on emissions trading, arguing  that the principles, modalities, rules and guidelines for trading  should be defined by the COP. The issue was referred to UN legal  experts.

On the draft COP decision on principles, nature and scope of the  mechanisms, CANADA and JAPAN, opposed by the EU, G-77/CHINA and  SAMOA, proposed deleting text emphasizing that environmental  integrity is to be achieved through sound modalities, rules and  guidelines for the mechanisms, strict principles and rules  governing LULUCF, and a strong compliance regime. After some  discussion, the original text was retained, with reference to  'strict' being replaced with 'sound and strong.' Consideration of  the related draft COP/MOP decision continued in an afternoon  session, with Co-Chair Chow suggesting deleting a paragraph  specifying that the provisions on the use of mechanisms shall  apply individually for Parties acting under Article 4 (joint  fulfillment), on the understanding that in Bonn the flexibility on  supplementarity was given to some countries in exchange of the  deletion of text on Article 4. AUSTRALIA, CANADA and JAPAN opposed  the deletion, arguing, inter alia, that broader issues of  transparency and good governance were involved. The paragraph was  referred to the ministers.

The negotiating group then considered the Co-Chairs' Article 7.4  non-paper. Delegates exchanged views and articulated their  respective positions on, inter alia: the fixed or dynamic nature  of assigned amounts; the possibility to restrict the use of  mechanisms depending on a Party's ratification of the Protocol;  the definition of assigned amount as a level or a volume of units;  the need for a new concept to identify units resulting from  project activities under Protocol Article 3.3 (afforestation,  reforestation, deforestation) and 3.4 (additional activities), or  the possibility for transparency concerns to be covered by the  existence of a unit serial number; the possibility of setting  limits on the transferability of CERs, banking and carry-over; and  the distinction, if any, between subtraction and transfer of  units, and between acquisition and addition of units. The EU,  SAMOA and AUSTRALIA suggested that differences in opinion could be  bridged by moving the debate away from conceptual approaches and  toward a discussion of their consequences.

Co-Chair Chow concluded by highlighting that the ultimate deadline  was approaching and that despite the importance of Article 7.4,  including for the resolution of issues in other negotiating  groups, a 'spirit of compromise' had not been in evidence. He said  the Co-Chairs would conduct bilateral consultations with regional  groups in an attempt to move things forward. The negotiating group  reconvened late evening, continuing its work into the night.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The negotiating group on Articles 5,  7 and 8 met in an evening session to take stock of the work of the  drafting groups, which had met throughout the day. Drafting group  Chair Plume reported from the LULUCF group, noting three areas of  contention: issues linked to outcomes from the mechanisms and  Article 7.4 groups; reporting on area of land; and incorporation  of LULUCF principles into the texts. She said she had prepared a  Chair's proposal, and that the new text would be distributed  Tuesday morning.

Regarding work on non-LULUCF matters, drafting group Chair  Luboyera noted some progress, but said work had not been completed  in the time available. He said a number of issues related to the  Expert Review Teams had been resolved, although disagreements  remained over their composition. Regarding thresholds, he stated  that the issue was being considered as a package, and was not yet  resolved. He said more consultations on Article 3.14 (adverse  effects) were needed among some regional groups, and some  outstanding issues remained on mandatory aspects. On  confidentiality, he said a decision paragraph had been suggested  requesting SBSTA-17 to consider views from Parties on the matter.

CHINA indicated that it had prepared a proposal on supplementarity  under Article 7.2 (national communications). SAUDI ARABIA  highlighted a proposal on the commitment period reserve, BRAZIL  proposed language on the final review report of the ERTs, and  JAPAN said it had a new proposal on a new procedure for the final  compilation report. These proposals were not discussed further due  to time constraints.

### COMPLIANCE

Delegates met throughout the day in a series of  informal consultations between regional groups in an attempt to  resolve outstanding issues on applicable consequences and the  draft COP decision, with little progress reported by Monday  evening. The negotiating group convened for a late night session  in order to take stock of advances made in informal consultations  and in an effort to resolve outstanding issues.

### CGE

The CGE contact group met in a brief morning and a longer  evening session to discuss and agree on two revised draft  decisions. The evening session was co-chaired by SBI Chair Ashe  and Chair Ojoo-Massawa. Parties first discussed the draft decision  on improving the guidelines for the preparation of non-Annex I  national communications. They addressed at length the timing for  three issues: the improvement and adoption of the guidelines; the  preparation of draft improved guidelines and a workshop to be held  on this; and the submission by Parties of proposals on the draft  guidelines to the Secretariat. UGANDA, for the LDCs, supported  adopting the improved guidelines at COP-10, while the G-77/CHINA  preferred COP-9. The US, with AUSTRALIA, supported doing this at  COP-8, underscoring the relevant COP-5 decision  that had  scheduled this for COP-7, and stressed that it was not acceptable  to postpone this for longer than one year. SBI Chair Ashe proposed  COP-8 for the adoption of the improved guidelines, that the  workshop be held prior to the 16th session of the subsidiary  bodies, and that proposals on these guidelines by Parties be  submitted by 5 August 2002 for consideration at SBI-17. Delegates  agreed.

Chair Ojoo-Massawa then presented the draft decision on the CGE,  noting that all reference to LDCs and NAPAs remains bracketed  pending the decision taken in the LDC consultations on whether  mention of LDCs and NAPAs would be included in the CGE decision.  The G-77/CHINA stressed the importance of a paragraph on  evaluating the real cost of preparing national communications. The  EU, with AUSTRALIA, highlighted that this skill-set was not  present in the CGE, and supported deleting the paragraph. Parties  agreed. Outstanding issues then related to dates for workshops to  be held, and the review of the terms of reference for the CGE. The  G-77/CHINA proposed two workshops be held in 2002, and that the  terms of reference be reviewed at COP-8, to which delegates  agreed.

### LDCS

The LDC drafting group continued its work, addressing the  draft negotiating text on the establishment of an LDC expert  group. No movement was reported on the operation of the LDC Fund.  Discussions continued throughout the day and into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Several delegates were expressing concern Monday evening as a  'stock-taking' Plenary was canceled due to the pressing need to  continue talks in negotiating and drafting groups. Although the  Bureau seemed confident that substantial progress could be made  overnight, some observers were skeptical that major breakthroughs  would occur on the remaining big issues, suggesting that delegates  would hold on to 'negotiating capital' until closer to the high- level segment due to start Wednesday. As the COP-7 countdown  continued, several participants appeared anxious at the number of  issues still to be resolved. Key areas of contention include  eligibility criteria on the mechanisms, the commitment period  reserve under Article 17, applicable consequences in relation to  compliance, and reporting on LULUCF and supplementarity. In  addition, Article 7.4 is a cross-cutting issue that many feel has  not yet entered a substantive negotiating stage. In spite of this  heavy agenda, however, optimists point out that all these  outstanding issues could be resolved by the end of the conference.
