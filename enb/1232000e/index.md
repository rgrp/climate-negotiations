# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

SBI returned to Agenda Item 4, financial and technical  cooperation (FCCC/CP/1996/8 & 9 and FCCC/SBI/1996/10). The  G-77/CHINA called for harmonization of GEF strategies with  those of FCCC, specifically: more flexible processes;  clarifying incremental cost; removing conditionalities from  GEF replenishment negotiations; and eliminating criteria of  cost-effectiveness and avoiding duplication in funding for  national communications. He later submitted a revised draft  on the item.

Several developed country delegations endorsed the Chair's  text on the financial mechanism. SWITZERLAND and CANADA  called for expedited funding for national communications.  FRANCE  suggested that Parties submit complaints about GEF  performance for review at future COP sessions. KENYA said  many African countries are experiencing excessive delays and  linkage of projects to operational conditions not required  by FCCC.

MICRONESIA said small island States need the GEF to  prioritize enabling activities and to be more responsive.  JAPAN opposed the draft MOU approved by the GEF Council.  KUWAIT said the COP is the supreme body as affirmed in  Article 11.1 of the FCCC and not the GEF Council. CHINA said  the GEF should accelerate project approval. The US conceded  delays in developing guidelines on enabling activities but  opposed the suggestion that cost effectiveness should not be  a criteria. He discouraged micromanagement of the GEF.  AUSTRALIA supported streamlining efforts. MEXICO supported  the MOU and Annex. TUNISIA reported delays in GEF funding  approval. The Chair noted a GEF Council undertaking to  accelerate decision making. He invited Parties to refer  draft decisions to an informal group chaired by John Ashe  (Antigua and Barbuda).

The Chair then introduced Agenda item 3 (national  communications), including the second compilation of first  national communications from Annex I Parties (FCCC/CP/  1996/12 and Add.1) and emission inventories and projections  for 2000 (Add.2) and the reporting schedule  (FCCC/CP/1996/13). The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that few  developed countries would reduce emissions to 1990 levels by  2000. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for expanded analysis of  GHG emissions. The EU, supported by AUSTRALIA, said the  documents are the principal source to assess progress. The  US called for GHG emissions significantly below 1990 levels  and policies beyond no-regrets actions.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

SBSTA resumed discussion of AIJ following a meeting of the  G-77/CHINA. The EU suggested reporting requirements be  standardized, simplified, and more reflective of project  cost effectiveness, and encouraged workshops. The G-77/CHINA, supported by COLOMBIA, INDIA and URAGUAY, noted  the need to better distinguish between AIJ projects and  those jointly implemented by Annex I countries. Financing  and technology transfer for AIJ projects must be  supplemental to what is stipulated in the FCCC. The CZECH  REPUBLIC urged adherence to the framework for pilot projects  adopted at COP-1 and supported the establishment of a  uniform reporting format.

AUSTRALIA and PANAMA supported AIJ workshops and a uniform  reporting format that is not onerous for developing  countries. The PHILIPPINES, supported by EL SALVADOR,  underscored technology transfer, capacity building, and  analysis of social impacts in AIJ projects and called for  transparency in reporting. NORWAY said it would be premature  to draw conclusions from the pilot phase and proposed the  establishment of an AIJ forum at SBSTA's December 1996  meeting. NICARAGUA supported NORWAY's proposal and uniform  reporting requirements.

MALAYSIA supported by CHINA recommended deferring AIJ  workshops until after COP-3 to avoid basing decisions on  inaccurate information and requested information on  budgetary implications of holding an AIJ forum. IRAN noted  that the principle of cost-effectiveness was not applied in  AIJ process and that some AIJ projects have been financed  with GEF funds. The Chair convened a group to produce  conclusions on the item.

On Agenda Item 8 (a) (roster of experts), the G-77/CHINA had  not yet considered the item and reserved its position. The  EU supported establishing an interim roster of experts to  allow for a learning phase on providing specialized  technical advice. He also accepted the addition of  adaptation technologies to the list of potential subjects.  CANADA, JAPAN AUSTRALIA and AOSIS also supported the roster  of experts. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said SBSTA should not  focus on specific features and that the use of scientific  data is a basic question for the experts. KIRIBATI asked  that fisheries be specifically mentioned as a topic for  consideration. The US said the issue should be deferred  until SBSTA clarifies the tasks for experts that do not  duplicate the work of other fora.

SBSTA resumed in the afternoon to consider Agenda Item 8(d)  (long-term work of SBSTA). The Chair introduced text which  was accepted. On Agenda Item 8(c) (cooperation with IPCC),  several delegations including the EU, AUSTRALIA, US, CANADA,  MYANMAR and MAURITIUS endorsed the IPCC. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION encouraged clarification of SBSTA's relationship  to the IPCC concerning the use of data. BURKINA FASO called  on the IPCC to expand research on regional GHG emission  limitations. The ICAO sought additional research on the  atmospheric effects of aviation. The Chair offered text on  the item, which was accepted.

Regarding Agenda Item 8(b) (research and systematic  observations), ARGENTINA, on behalf of the VALDIVIA GROUP,  called for more research on natural climate variability in  the region and on oceanic effects. IRAN sought enhanced data  collection at regional and sub-regional levels. UNESCO/IOC  expressed intent to expand research on the oceans' effects  on climate change. CANADA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, the US  and AUSTRALIA supported the expansion of research on climate  change conducted by IGOs and national governments,  particularly in the area of capacity building. The WMO  expressed willingness to entertain specific research  requests and cooperate with SBSTA in capacity building.  COLOMBIA urged increasing financial support for research and  capacity building at the national level.

On the business consultative mechanism, NEW ZEALAND reported  the draft results of a contact group. The text proposes that  the Secretariat explore further current mechanisms and  procedures to improve efficiency.

On Agenda Item 7 (technology transfer), delegates considered  the initial report on an inventory and assessment of  technologies (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/4/Add.2 ) and a follow-up  report on technological issues (FCCC/CP/1996/11). The EU  said first priority should be given to identification of  technology needs and the Secretariat should focus on  existing systems information centers. IRAN called for  establishment of an information pool on technology transfer.   MALAYSIA expressed disappointment and said the report  clearly describes developed country indifference.

The NETHERLANDS and the INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY  described the Climate Technology Initiative, a cooperative  effort to support the FCCC. CHINA suggested the Secretariat  prepare a proposal on the format for their communication  from Annex II on technology transfer. CANADA said  governments must provide an enabling environment for the  private sector to facilitate technology transfer.

The PHILIPPINES urged a hastening of work on technology  assessment and transfer.  The US noted the need for better  reporting on technology transfer. He suggested  'virtual'  technology information centers and a clearing house function  for the FCCC with private sector input.

The Chair presented a draft text on the SAR produced by the  'friends of the Chair.' The group also produced a draft of  the Chair's summary. The US reported that the contact group  on communications from non-Annex I Parties would reconvene  Friday morning.

# AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE

Convening AGBM 4 in the afternoon Chair Raul A. Estrada- Oyuela (Argentina) said the absence of legally binding  criteria on a return to 1990 emission levels makes new  commitments difficult and did not reflect views during FCCC  negotiations. There are various combinations of  measures  available to AGBM. It will not be possible to apply all  voluntarily. The prior condition for new developing  countries' commitments is compliance by developed countries.  He noted absence of agreement on voting and that insistence  on consensus might result in a veto. The option of an  amendment to the FCCC is being kept open for a three- quarters majority.

Parties adopted the agenda (FCCC/1996/CP/1996/1 and Add. 2).  The Chair noted that the Office of Legal Affairs had decided  Article 17.2 of the FCCC does not rule out modification of a  draft Protocol after circulation six months in advance of a  session. An electric power sector NGO recommended measures  for electric utilities and consumers. The WWF said there is  an urgent need to accelerate negotiations.  The Global  Action Climate Network said the SAR implies that Parties  must intensify efforts.

Under Agenda Item 3 (possible features of a protocol or  another legal instrument) (FCCC/AGBM/1996/MISC.1/Add.1 and  Add.3; MISC. 2 and Add 1; and 6), the EU said he had  submitted a Protocol proposal and indicated support for  'institutional economy' and a provision to allow Parties to  adopt future obligations.

The US, supported by CANADA, called for a decision on the  rules of procedure. CANADA and TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO on behalf  of AOSIS stated that Article 17.2 (six month rule) should  not hinder the new legal instrument. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  emphasized the principle of common but differentiated  responsibility and a regional approach to GHG reduction.  CANADA and JAPAN called for a flexible legal instrument.  AUSTRALIA, generally supported by CANADA, JAPAN, CHINA, and  NEW ZEALAND, called for a simple legally-binding instrument  administered by the FCCC Secretariat. AUSTRALIA and JAPAN  stated that its form should follow its content, while the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION, CHINA, BANGLADESH, MARSHALL ISLANDS and  MEXICO preferred a separate protocol.

AOSIS recalled its draft protocol calling for a 20%  reduction in 1990 GHG emissions, and stated that the  protocol should be open to all Parties. KUWAIT stated that  scientific information in the SAR was insufficient to inform  the AGBM process.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Observers were heard speculating on the outcome of Thursday  night's contact group on the rules of procedure. Some said  it could result in an agreement that institutionalizes the  status quo, wherein oil-producing states would not receive  their own seat on the Bureau but would be assured a regional  group seat. Others predicted that some governments were  still strongly opposed to this outcome and the group would  likely result in a stalemate.
