# INFORMAL MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Participants discussed Protocol Article  3.14 and outlined possible actions to minimize the adverse  effects of climate change and/or impacts of response  measures.

Actions to minimize the impacts of response measures: SAUDI  ARABIA said Annex I Parties should: eliminate tax  distortions and remove subsidies; discourage nuclear  energy; support wider use of CO2 sequestration  technologies; help with economic diversification; and  provide compensation where adverse effects are  demonstrated. The US recalled a recent OPEC study  indicating that joint action by OPEC members alone could be  sufficient to counteract any possible impact of response  measures on revenue flows. With AUSTRALIA, he noted efforts  by some oil-producing countries to set aside oil revenues  to help mitigate the impacts of response measures.  VENEZUELA cautioned against attempts to shift commitments  under Article 3.14 away from Annex I Parties. ZIMBABWE said  income from Annex I Parties' carbon taxes could be used to  support technology transfer, while SOUTH AFRICA added that  the revenue could fund relevant research.

Actions to minimize the impacts of climate change: The US  and UK said implementing the Protocol is the most important  step. AUSTRALIA supported a Protocol with a full,  competitive and transparent emissions trading regime and a  CDM regime that includes sinks. NIGERIA and VENEZUELA said  the mechanisms would be insufficient to ameliorate the  impacts of climate change. SENEGAL called for immediate  financial and technical support to implement adaptation  measures. BANGLADESH, BURKINA FASO and the SUDAN stressed  the need for early warning systems and disaster  preparedness. JAMAICA and BURKINA FASO highlighted the  special needs of least developed countries.

Future decisions and processes: On future decisions on FCCC  Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14, SWITZERLAND  said it preferred one decision on both, while SAUDI ARABIA,  CHINA and other developing countries supported separate  consideration and decisions, as Article 3.14 relates only  to responsibilities of Annex I Parties.

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY

Chair Dovland noted  that three regional workshops had been held to advance  understanding of technology needs, generate ideas on  enhancing technology transfer, and consider elements of a  framework for technology development and transfer.

Reporting on the African workshop, Peter Zhou (Botswana)  outlined technology transfer barriers including the lack of  climate change policies, weak legal and regulatory  frameworks, inadequate finance and problems with structural  adjustment programmes. He noted the need to, inter alia:  create strategic partnerships between governments, the  private sector, and donors; provide easier access to  financing environmentally-sound technologies (ESTs) and  local technologies; and enhance skills to support decision  making.

Mahendra Kumar (Samoa), reporting on the Asia-Pacific  workshop, said technology needs assessments should be  country-driven and transparent, involving multi-stakeholder  participation. He noted the limited attention paid to  adaptation technologies. Sheik Mohamed Khan (Guyana) said  the Latin America and Caribbean workshop stressed the need  to, inter alia: build indigenous capacities to assimilate  and absorb climate-friendly technologies; improve access to  technology information; involve smaller countries in  capacity building initiatives; and overcome political  barriers that result in low prioritization of technology  issues.

In the ensuing discussion, issues raised included the need  for a focus on technology transfer for adaptation and a  global advisory institution to assist countries handling  unsuitable technology. Ogunlade Davidson, IPCC, outlined  the IPCC Special Report on Methodological and Technological  Issues in Technology Transfer. He stressed that technology  transfer for climate change should always be viewed in the  FCCC's context, and underscored the need for rapid  technology innovation and broad transfer of EST for  mitigation and adaptation. The FCCC Secretariat introduced  the climate technology website  (http://www.icfconsulting.com/unfccc/climate.nsf) and the  project inventory database pilot initiative.

### COMPLIANCE

Delegates considered the Co-Chairs' Elements of  a Compliance System for the Kyoto Protocol. On Objective,  AUSTRALIA, with CANADA, sought to limit the compliance  system to Annex I Parties' commitments. The EU suggested  adding the objective of enforcing compliance.

On Nature and Principles, delegates expressed mixed views  on whether or not to include them explicitly. SAUDI ARABIA  and CHINA, opposed by AUSTRALIA and CANADA, proposed  specifying that the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities applied between Annex I and non-Annex I  Parties. SOUTH AFRICA, opposed by the US, proposed adding  the 'precautionary approach.' On Scope of Application, AUSTRALIA suggested specifying the  provisions on Annex I Parties' obligations to which the  system would apply. CANADA, the US, the EU and SWITZERLAND  supported the concept whereby the system applies to all  commitments. On Functions of a Compliance Institution,  SAUDI ARABIA proposed adding that all compliance and non- compliance issues pertaining to project activities under  Article 12 (CDM) shall be addressed by the CDM's Executive  Board. Supported by NEW ZEALAND, the US said the text  should specify that the compliance system is supplementary  to all compliance aspects under the Protocol. AUSTRALIA and  the EU suggested an additional function of determining  whether or not a Party is in compliance with Article 3.1.

On Referral, the US, SOUTH AFRICA and SWITZERLAND, opposed  by SAUDI ARABIA, favored a role for reports by expert  review teams (ERTs). The US, SWITZERLAND, NEW ZEALAND,  CHILE and BRAZIL opposed a role for the COP/MOP. The UK,  opposed by several delegates, supported a role for the  Secretariat.

On Screening, SWITZERLAND stressed the need to identify  criteria and, in order to help delegates get a clear view  of the flow of information under the review and compliance  processes, to prepare a flow chart. SOUTH AFRICA, with the  UK, identified two screening processes: the channeling of a  case to the proper forum and assessing if a case is  unfounded or de minimis. With the US and the UK, but  opposed by CHILE and SAUDI ARABIA, she said the former task  could be performed by the Secretariat. She added that the  latter task required a substantive assessment of a case  that, if undertaken by a separate entity, could duplicate  the work of the compliance institution.

### IPCC SPECIAL REPORT

IPCC Chair Robert Watson presented the  major findings of the IPCC Special Report on Land Use,  Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), which were then  elaborated by the lead authors. On the global carbon cycle,  Bert Bolin said ecosystem models indicate that additional  terrestrial uptake of atmospheric CO2 arising from indirect  anthropogenic effects is likely to be maintained for  several decades in the forest ecosystems, but may gradually  diminish. Robert Watson underscored that defining  afforestation, reforestation and deforestation will be  critical, as this will determine the amount of land falling  under Article 3.3 and treatment of the harvesting- regeneration cycle. On carbon accounting, he presented  land-based and activity-based approaches, noting that in  the former case it is difficult to factor out human-induced  activities, while the latter poses a risk of double  counting. Bernard Schlamadinger outlined three different  accounting approaches applied to the FAO definitional  scenario as well as the IPCC scenario to illustrate the  effect of different approaches under Article 3.3.

On Article 3.4, Robert Scholes noted that the magnitude of  additional activities could be substantial compared to  Article 3.1 obligations, and distinguished between changes  in management and in land cover. He highlighted  verifiability and associated non-climate impacts and  benefits as key issues for the COP.

Jayant Sathaye noted that LULUCF project experience is  being gained through AIJ activities. He discussed concerns  with LULUCF projects, notably permanence, baselines,  additionality, carbon leakage, monitoring and verification  and implementation of sustainability conditions. N.H  Ravindranath highlighted provisions for LULUCF in current  IPCC guidelines, and how they might be revised to  accommodate requirements of the Protocol, including  additional activities under Article 3.4 and project-based  activities. Peter Frumhoff said a system of criteria and  indicators could be useful to compare sustainable  development impacts across LULUCF alternatives. He said  potential for synergies with other multilateral  environmental agreements exist, and that several factors,  inter alia, institutional and technical capacity, community  participation and technology transfer, are critical to  strengthening the sustainable development impacts of LULUCF  activities.

In the ensuing discussion, a number of delegates noted  uncertainties in the research, while several sought  clarification on technical issues. Participants also raised  issues related to: sustainable development and a relevant  framework; avoiding deforestation in tropical regions;  consistent ground and atmospheric definitions; the effect  of climate on photosynthetic potential in tropical regions;  the potential for sinks activities to account for a  significant proportion of Annex I Parties' Protocol  obligations; and questions relating to a full carbon  accounting system.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Chair Ashe said the meeting aimed at  developing a draft framework for capacity building, with  the first session focussing on economies in transition  (EITs). The RUSSIAN FEDERATION asked about timeframes for  capacity building. CANADA urged EITs to integrate capacity  building into national planning processes, and to share  their experiences. Various US agencies outlined their  capacity building activities for EITs. The EU highlighted  the need for institutional capacity on inventories and on  Protocol Articles 5 and 7. ROMANIA emphasized the  importance of capacity building for inventories, JI, and  institutional and regulatory frameworks, and suggested  reference to 'capacity development.' HUNGARY urged greater  efforts to harmonize capacity building actions for EITs.  ENVIRONMENTAL DEFENSE and CANADA emphasized that capacity  building should be sustainable.  EGYPT suggested expanding  capacity building to other stakeholders and maximizing the  use of regional institutions. The US underlined the fact  that EITs have commitments to reduce emissions and  suggested using the Protocol mechanisms to support capacity  building. Noting the existing technical and scientific  capacity in EITs, SWITZERLAND underlined the need for  political support. NIGERIA noted the need to build capacity  in negotiating skills and outlined recent initiatives.

### GUIDELINES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Subgroup on  Articles 5.2 (adjustments) and 8 (review of information):  Co-Chair James Penman (UK) asked the Secretariat to prepare  new Draft Guidelines under Protocol Article 8, based on the  structure of an EU proposal containing: General Approach,  National Inventory Submissions, Information on Assigned  Amounts, National Systems, National Registries, and  National Communications and Other Commitments.  The group  then continued its consideration of Part II of the  guidelines. On Classification of Inventory Problems, the EU  presented its non-paper providing for, inter alia,  categories of problems triggering an expedited procedure.  The EU explained that under this procedure: the ERTs would  notify both the Party under review and the compliance  committee about a problem; the problems triggering an  expedited procedure would be assessable during the initial  check of inventories; and temporary measures would apply  until the problem was solved.

Subgroup on Article 5.1 (national systems): This subgroup  received a partial redraft of the second Draft Guidelines  for National Systems under Protocol Article 5.1. Several  delegates expressed their views on reporting with regard to  national systems, and on links to Article 7. Delegates also  approved minor technical changes to sub-paragraphs on  Inventory Preparation.
