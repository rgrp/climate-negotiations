abstract: "The Lima Climate Change Conference convened from 1-14 December 2014, in Lima, Peru. It included the 20th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP 20) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 10th session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 10). Three subsidiary bodies (SBs) also met: the 41st sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA 41) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI 41), and the seventh part of the second session of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP 2-7). The Lima Climate Change Conference brought together over 11,000 participants, including approximately 6,300 government officials, 4,000 representatives from UN bodies and agencies, intergovernmental organizations and civil society organizations, and 900 members of the media. Negotiations in Lima focused on outcomes under the ADP necessary to advance towards an agreement in Paris at COP 21 in 2015, including elaboration of the information, and process, required for submission of intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) as early as possible in 2015 and progress on elements of a draft negotiating text. Following lengthy negotiations on a draft decision for advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, COP 20 adopted the Lima Call for Climate Action, which sets in motion the negotiations in the coming year towards a 2015 agreement, the process for submitting and reviewing INDCs, and enhancing pre-2020 ambition. Parties also adopted 19 decisions, 17 under the COP and two under the CMP that, inter alia : help operationalize the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage; establish the Lima work programme on gender; and adopt the Lima Declaration on Education and Awareness Raising. The Lima Climate Change Conference was able to lay the groundwork for Paris next year, by capturing progress made in elaborating the elements of a draft negotiating text for the 2015 agreement and adopting a decision on INDCs, including their scope, upfront information, and steps to be taken by the Secretariat after their submission."

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

The international political response to climate change began with the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992, which sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. The Convention, which entered into force on 21 March 1994, now has 196 parties. In December 1997, delegates to the third session of the COP in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to a protocol to the UNFCCC that committed industrialized countries and countries in transition to a market economy to achieve emission reduction targets. These countries, known as Annex I parties under the UNFCCC, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six GHGs by an average of 5% below 1990 levels in 2008-2012 (first commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to country. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005, and now has 192 parties.

## LONG-TERM NEGOTIATIONS, 2005-2009:

Convening in Montreal, Canada, in 2005, the first session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP 1) decided to establish the Ad Hoc Working Group on Annex I Parties Further Commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (AWG-KP) in accordance with Protocol Article 3.9, which mandated consideration of Annex I parties further commitments at least seven years before the end of the first commitment period. In December 2007, COP 13 and CMP 3 in Bali, Indonesia, resulted in agreement on the Bali Roadmap on long-term issues. COP 13 adopted the Bali Action Plan (BAP) and established the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention (AWG-LCA) with a mandate to focus on mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology and a shared vision for long-term cooperative action. Negotiations on Annex I parties further commitments continued under the AWG-KP. The deadline for concluding the two-track negotiations was in 2009 in Copenhagen.

## COPENHAGEN:

The UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, took place in December 2009. The high-profile event was marked by disputes over transparency and process. Late in the evening of 18 December, these talks resulted in a political agreement, the Copenhagen Accord, which was then presented to the COP plenary for adoption. After 13 hours of debate, delegates ultimately agreed to take note of the Copenhagen Accord and to extend the mandates of the negotiating groups until COP 16 and CMP 6 in 2010. In 2010, over 140 countries indicated support for the Accord. More than 80 countries also provided information on their national mitigation targets or actions.

## CANCUN:

The UN Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico, took place in December 2010, where parties finalized the Cancun Agreements and extended the mandates of the two AWGs for another year. Under the Convention track, Decision 1/CP.16 recognized the need for deep cuts in global emissions in order to limit the global average temperature rise to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. Parties agreed to consider strengthening the global long-term goal during a review by 2015, including in relation to a proposed 1.5 °C target. Decision 1/CP.16 also addressed other aspects of mitigation, such as: measuring, reporting and verification (MRV); and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+). The Cancun Agreements also established several new institutions and processes, including the Cancun Adaptation Framework, the Adaptation Committee and the Technology Mechanism, which includes the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network. The Green Climate Fund (GCF) was created and designated as an operating entity of the Convention s financial mechanism. Under the Protocol track, the CMP urged Annex I parties to raise the level of ambition towards achieving aggregate emission reductions, and adopted Decision 2/CMP.6 on land use, land-use change and forestry.

## DURBAN:

The UN Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, took place from 28 November to 11 December 2011. The Durban outcomes covered a wide range of topics, notably the agreement to establish a second commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, a decision on long-term cooperative action under the Convention and agreement on the operationalization of the GCF. Parties also agreed to launch the ADP with a mandate to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties. The ADP is scheduled to complete these negotiations by 2015, with the new instrument entering into force in 2020. In addition, the ADP was mandated to explore actions to close the pre-2020 ambition gap in relation to the 2 °C target.

## DOHA:

The UN Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar, took place in November and December 2012. The conference resulted in a package of decisions, referred to as the Doha Climate Gateway. These include amendments to the Kyoto Protocol to establish its second commitment period and agreement to terminate the AWG-KP s work in Doha. The parties also agreed to terminate the AWG-LCA and negotiations under the BAP. A number of issues requiring further consideration were transferred to the SBI and the SBSTA, such as: the 2013-2015 Review of the global goal; developed and developing country mitigation; the Kyoto Protocol s flexibility mechanisms; national adaptation plans; MRV; market and non-market mechanisms; and REDD+.

## WARSAW:

The Warsaw Climate Change Conference took place from 11-23 November 2013, in Warsaw, Poland. Negotiations focused on the implementation of agreements reached at previous meetings, including pursuing the work of the ADP. The meeting adopted an ADP decision that invites parties to initiate or intensify domestic preparations for their INDCs, and resolves to accelerate the full implementation of the BAP and pre-2020 ambition. Parties also adopted a decision establishing the Warsaw International Mechanism on Loss and Damage, and the Warsaw REDD+ Framework - a series of seven decisions on REDD+ finance, institutional arrangements and methodological issues.

## ADP 2-4:

The fourth meeting of ADP 2 (ADP 2-4) took place from 10-14 March 2014 in Bonn, Germany. Under workstream 1 (2015 agreement), the meeting convened in open-ended consultations on agenda item 3, which addressed: adaptation; INDCs; finance, technology and capacity building (means of implementation); ambition and equity; mitigation; transparency of action and support; and other issues related to elements. An in-session workshop addressed domestic preparations for INDCs. Under workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition), technical expert meetings (TEMs) on renewable energy and energy efficiency convened.

## BONN INTERSESSIONAL MEETINGS:

The Bonn Climate Change Conference took place in Bonn, Germany, from 4-15 June 2014, and included the 40th sessions of the SBI and SBSTA, and the fifth meeting of the second session of the ADP (ADP 2-5). During the meeting, parties advanced negotiations on the ADP and prepared draft decisions to be submitted to the COP and CMP in Lima. Ministers participated in two high-level events, a High-Level Ministerial Roundtable under the Kyoto Protocol, which aimed to assess implementation of the Protocol and provide ministers with an opportunity to increase their countries quantified emission limitation and reduction commitments, and a High-Level Ministerial Dialogue on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action aimed to raise pre-2020 ambition and provide momentum for negotiations on the 2015 agreement.

## ADP 2-6:

The sixth meeting of ADP 2 took place in Bonn from 20-25 October 2014. Under workstream 1, countries continued to elaborate the elements of a draft negotiating text, which will serve as the foundation for the final construction of the 2015 agreement, and considered a non-paper on parties views and proposals on the elements for a draft negotiating text. The ADP also worked on a draft decision that captures the type of information countries will provide when they communicate their INDCs and how these contributions will potentially be considered. Under workstream 2, TEMs focused on: opportunities for action on non-CO2 GHGs; carbon capture, use and storage; and follow-up to TEMs on unlocking mitigation opportunities through energy efficiency, renewable energy, urban environment and land use improvements in the pre-2020 period. Countries also addressed a draft decision on pre-2020 ambition.

# LIMA CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE REPORT

On Monday, 1 December, COP 19/CMP 9 President Marcin Korolec welcomed delegates to the joint COP/MOP opening ceremony highlighting several significant outcomes of COP 19 and lauding early engagement by Peru and France, which is allowing the trio to make the road to Paris a smooth highway. Peru s Minister of Environment Manuel Pulgar-Vidal said COP 20 should increase trust, create space for dialogue between state and non-state actors, and lay groundwork for a new climate agreement through a draft text balancing climate action and sustainable development. Stressing the key role of large cities in combating climate change, Susana Villarán de la Puente, Mayor of Lima, Peru, highlighted the commitment of mayors worldwide to push for a new mobility paradigm, change the energy matrix and invest in green infrastructure. Pointing to the lines and geoglyphs of Nazca, Peru, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres encouraged parties to, inter alia : draft a new universal agreement; achieve progress on adaptation; and strengthen the financial capacity of the most vulnerable. Via recorded video message, President of Peru Ollanta Humala lamented that humanity has left behind the practice of sustainability and said now is the time to return to the right path by taking action on climate change. Presenting the key findings of the Synthesis Report (SYR) of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, IPCC Chair, stressed that remaining below the 2 °C target will require that GHG emissions decline by 40-70% by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and reach zero or negative levels by 2100. This report summarizes the discussions by the COP, CMP, SBI, SBSTA and ADP based on their respective agendas. Negotiations and outcomes under the COP and CMP on issues forwarded to the SBI, SBSTA and ADP are summarized in the context of negotiations under the relevant subsidiary body.

## WORK PROGRAMME ON CLARIFICATION OF QUANTIFIED ECONOMY-WIDE EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS OF DEVELOPED COUNTRY PARTIES:

This item (FCCC/SBSTA/2014/INF.16 and FCCC/TP/2014/8) was first considered on Monday, 1 December. SBSTA Chair Dlamini proposed, and parties agreed to, informal consultations facilitated by Cristina Carreiras (Portugal) and Brian Mantlana (South Africa). During the SBSTA closing plenary on Saturday, 6 December, the SBSTA adopted conclusions. Final Outcome: In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2014/ L.22), the SBSTA concludes the work programme on clarification of quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets of developed country parties. The SBSTA recognizes the importance of shared information and transparency in the clarification of the quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets and noted that activities undertaken under the work programme since SBSTA 38 have provided a platform for parties to share information and have helped improve the transparency of developed country party targets. The SBSTA also, inter alia :- acknowledges that there is a limited number of approaches among developed country parties for measuring the progress made towards the achievement of targets and the importance of convergence in the coverage of sectors and gases as well as the use of global warming potential values among developed country parties; - acknowledges that the additional information provided by developed country parties increased the transparency of targets and helped to facilitate the consideration of the comparability of efforts among developed country parties; - acknowledges the discussions on the transparency of, and reporting on, the use of carbon credits from market-based mechanisms; and - notes that there is more than one approach to account for the role of LULUCF in achieving developed country party targets and acknowledged, regarding the comparability of efforts, that comprehensive, complete and consistent coverage of the reported information is more significant than the choice of approach.

## ADP ITEM 3 - DRAFT DECISION ON ADVANCING THE DURBAN PLATFORM FOR ENHANCED ACTION:

### Procedural Summary

On Tuesday, 2 December, ADP Co-Chair Artur Runge-Metzger (EU) presented the Draft Decision on Advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP.2014.12.DraftText) issued by the Co-Chairs in advance of ADP 2-7, reminding parties that positioning is not negotiating and urging them to make precise and concise proposals that can bridge differences. Many developing countries called for direct negotiations with parties proposals on the screen and cautioned against the Co-Chairs coming forward with their interpretation of the common ground in the form of a revised Co-Chairs text. Others preferred to work on the basis of the Co-Chairs text.

ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger proposed going swiftly through the Co-Chairs text while allowing all parties time to give their views in order to identify sticking points. On Wednesday, 3 December, many developing countries continued to call for showing their proposals on the screen, while the US preferred to continue with a more general reading of the text to identify the major issues in the negotiations. Tuvalu suggested, and parties agreed to, establishing a Friends of the Chair group to reach agreement on the way forward. The Friends of the Chair group convened in the evening to agree on how to move forward. They agreed: to conduct a first reading of the Co-Chairs draft text (ADP.2014.12.DraftText), allowing parties to introduce their proposals by displaying them on the screen; to hold dedicated meetings of the contact group on specific sections and paragraphs; and for the Co-Chairs to prepare a synthesis integrating parties proposals into a revised draft decision text. On Saturday, 4 December, an informal ADP stocktaking meeting took place. COP 20/CMP 10 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal described the first week as one of proposals, explanations and clarifications, and called for the second week to be one of dialogue, flexibility and construction in order to deliver, by Thursday evening, 11 December, the outcome the world is expecting from us. ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh proposed, and parties agreed, that the Co-Chairs make available, by Monday morning, improved versions of the non-paper on elements and of the draft decision on advancing the ADP, based on input received from parties during the first week. On Monday, 8 December, ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger introduced a revised version of the draft decision on advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, now called the Draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs. He noted it: is based on inputs provided by parties, explaining that all parties views were captured in a compilation published on the ADP website; presents a synthesis of the core areas introduced by parties; and addresses all aspects of our mandate. Many developing countries raised concerns over the legal status of the revised draft decision, with some stressing the document remains a non-paper. They also underscored that their concerns had not been captured in the text. Others expressed willingness to work on the basis of the revised draft decision. Co-Chair Runge-Metzger assured parties that the documents had no legal status, noting that parties would have to give it legal status. He suggested dedicating time to the decision, which parties had agreed should be taken in Lima. Runge-Metzger urged parties to proceed as we agreed last week and consider the draft decision paragraph by paragraph to find compromise and consensus. During the remaining negotiating time on Monday, 8 December, and throughout Tuesday and Wednesday, 9-10 December, the contact group on item 3 continued paragraph-by-paragraph negotiations on the draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs, with parties proposing extensive alternative options within the text. On Wednesday evening the draft text stood at 58 pages. China proposed, and other parties agreed, to initiate the reading of the draft decision from the preamble. On Thursday, 11 December, the contact group convened briefly and suspended so that negotiating groups could consult among themselves on how to proceed. The contact group convened briefly in the late afternoon, with parties disagreeing on whether to continue in a contact group or a Friends of the Chair format. In the evening, during a joint COP/CMP stocktaking plenary, COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal exhorted parties to reach agreement and asked the ADP Co-Chairs to produce a revised draft decision text by 9:00 pm. Late in the evening the contact group resumed, with ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger presenting the revised seven-page, Draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs. He described the new version of the draft text as: not a take it or leave it text; not a suggested compromise text; but instead, a text that tries to capture where parties positioned themselves and identifies negotiation space for parties. The contact group was then suspended. On Friday, 12 December, the contact group reconvened in the morning to consider the revised draft decision. Inviting parties to consult with him in his open-door office, COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal stressed his responsibility to maintain confidence, inclusiveness and transparency in the process, noting this as necessary for a successful outcome in Lima and Paris. He explained that the new text by the Co-Chairs resulted from a previous unworkable text and calls for providing direction. He asked Minister Tine Sundtoft (Norway) and Minister Vivian Balakrishnan (Singapore) to facilitate consultations as well. Substantive discussions on the text continued until 2:00 pm, when the contact group was suspended for an informal stocktaking plenary, where COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal instructed the ADP to hear the remaining speakers and informed that he, and the ministers, would continue consultations. The contact group resumed shortly thereafter and continued until all speakers had been heard, and adjourned pending further guidance by the COP 20/CMP 10 President. Throughout the evening, bilateral ministerial consultations and consultations with negotiating groups took place. The contact group resumed at 2:18 am, Saturday, 13 December. COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal and ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger introduced a draft decision (FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5) proposed by the Co-Chairs, based on views presented during the contact group and in the informal consultations. Runge-Metzger proposed to adjourn the contact group and convene the ADP closing plenary. Numerous interventions followed from the floor, during which parties and groups of parties requested further time to consider the text and expressed concerns that they had not been consulted either by the ministers or the COP President. Others, noting the time, called for agreement on moving forward as proposed. At 3:30 am the ADP contact group adjourned so that parties could further consider the text. The closing plenary of the ADP began at 10:41 am on Saturday. Parties variously supported and opposed the revised draft decision. The ADP Co-Chairs submitted, under their authority, the draft decision to the COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal for further consultations. After the suspension of ADP 2-7 at 1:31 pm, Pulgar-Vidal announced he would undertake consultations with groups of parties to find consensus on the text. During the COP 20 closing plenary, which convened at 11:37 pm, on Saturday, 13 December, ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh informed that the ADP concluded its intensive work by considering a draft decision (FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5). He said that, having listened to parties, the Co-Chairs forwarded, on their own authority, the draft decision to the COP president for further consultations.

COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal then introduced the Proposal by the President containing a draft decision on further advancing the Durban Platform (FCCC/CP/2014/L.14), saying it is a product of all parties work and with it we all win. At 11:53 pm he suspended the session for an hour to give parties time to consider the text. When the COP 20 closing plenary resumed at 1:23 am, on Sunday, 14 December, COP 20 President Pulgar-Vidal noted the draft decision moves us forward, and requested parties rise to the challenge of approving it. The COP adopted the draft decision and agreed to call it the Lima Call for Climate Action. Tuvalu, for the LDCs, stated their understanding of the decision, including that reference to the Warsaw Mechanism for Loss and Damage in the preambular paragraph, and the reference to inter alia in paragraph 2 of the decision, represented a clear intention that the 2015 agreement will properly, effectively and progressively address loss and damage. Substantive Discussions - First Reading: On Tuesday and Wednesday, 2-3 December, substantive discussions on the draft decision on advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action began, focusing on general reactions. On recommending text of a protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention, the Russian Federation, with the EU and Tuvalu, proposed including reference to Convention Article 17 (protocols) and applied rules of procedure, so that the six-month rule for introducing text can be adhered to. The US noted this only applies to a protocol, while the Durban Platform allows for several possibilities regarding the instrument under preparation. Venezuela suggested addressing the elephant in the room, namely that one set of parties seeks a mitigation-based outcome and another feels it should be based on all the elements of the BAP. On the completion of work of the ADP, India suggested removing as early as possible. Brazil proposed adding a reference to accompanying draft decisions after COP 21. Kenya opposed any text on accompanying decisions at this stage. On parity between adaptation and mitigation, Australia and Norway proposed deletion of text relating to achieving political parity between mitigation and adaptation. India suggested referring to full legal parity instead. Brazil suggested parity between the operational provisions regarding mitigation, adaptation and means of implementation (MOI). China suggested text on, inter alia , deciding to achieve the balanced and comprehensive treatment among the elements of mitigation, adaptation, MOI, and transparency of action and support in the negotiating text of the 2015 agreement. While stressing that adaptation and mitigation should receive equal treatment and resources, India called for a shared understanding on political parity. Saying parity is vague, the US proposed underscoring the importance of adaptation. On demonstrating implementation of existing actions and commitments, Australia suggested this text should be addressed in the preamble. Norway said reference to implementation of existing actions and commitments are not necessary. Brazil proposed adding references to the Doha Amendment and the annual US$100 billion finance goal by 2020. China called for underlining that the full and effective implementation of existing commitments and actions under the Convention, its Kyoto Protocol and the agreed outcome pursuant to the BAP, in particular for developed country parties, is essential for adoption of the 2015 agreement. On links to the elements of the 2015 agreement, the US indicated openness to listing thematic areas identified in Decision 1/CP.17 (establishing the ADP), referring to these as aspects of work, if this helps provide assurances that these will be addressed in the 2015 agreement. Focused discussions on specific sections of the text began on Thursday, 4 December. On paragraphs 1-6 (elements) , Canada suggested that the ADP address various topics instead of all elements, and that achieving political parity between mitigation and adaptation be replaced with elevating their critical importance. New Zealand advocated text signaling that the work of the ADP will result in a package of different components. Japan stressed the need to clarify that mitigation is the ultimate goal of the Convention. Pakistan and South Africa called for treating all elements of Decision 1/CP.17 in a balanced manner. Mexico and Saudi Arabia stressed the equal importance of adaptation and mitigation. Pakistan and Egypt preferred legal parity between mitigation and adaptation. Ecuador called for deleting qualifiers when referring to parity between mitigation and adaptation. South Africa called for strengthening paragraphs dealing with assurances in relation to the link between INDCs and the elements of the agreement, and the balance of support for mitigation and adaptation. On the importance of transparency, Ecuador called for adopting an MRV mechanism as part of the 2015 agreement. On paragraphs 7-12 (INDCs) , Japan said the text still did not provide clarity on the upfront information to be presented in INDCs. South Africa said that, while INDCs are nationally determined, their scope should be determined internationally, and, with Brazil and others, that they should include mitigation, adaptation and MOI. Canada and the US stressed that INDCs relate to mitigation. Brazil and Tuvalu, for the LDCs, noted that the scope should not be limited to Convention Article 2 (objective). Australia underscored that INDCs should reflect efforts parties are making unilaterally. The LDCs recommended inserting a caveat for LDCs and SIDS on the inclusion of mitigation in INDCs. New Zealand said that, when reporting on INDCs, parties should quantify expected emission outcomes, levels of effort and accounting methodologies in the land sector. The EU urged transparency, quantifiability and comparability of INDC reporting. Bolivia stressed the importance of enhancing the provision of MOI to developing countries. Cautioning against bias towards mitigation actions, Tuvalu, for the LDCs, suggested adding text on MRV of Annex I parties support to developing countries for the achievement of the latter s INDCs. Thailand underscored equal treatment of mitigation and adaptation. The US said reporting requirements should apply equally to developed and developing countries. On paragraphs 13-16 (INDC communication) , Argentina, Chile, for the Independent Alliance of Latin America and the Caribbean (AILAC), China, India, Algeria, for the Arab Group, South Africa, Tanzania and many others emphasized the relevance of the principles and provisions of the Convention. Switzerland opposed division between Annex I and non-Annex I countries. China said information on INDCs should enhance clarity of developed countries ambition and reflect the diversity of, barriers to and needs for, developing countries INDCs. Brazil said INDCs: should not be interpreted as an expectation of legal terms ; opposed self-differentiation; and, with Sudan, for the African Group, requested making reference to equity. Switzerland called for references to underlying assumptions and efforts, and fairness considerations. The Marshall Islands proposed that the ADP develop rules relating to accounting assumptions and approaches, land use, and use of international markets and credits, with a view to their adoption by COP 21. Bolivia opposed reference to market tools and instruments. Tanzania opposed prescriptive INDCs and any additional reporting requirements for developing countries. Singapore emphasized clarity of information provided. Saudi Arabia suggested the INDCs adaptation component should enhance efforts to achieve best-value outcomes through early and integrated planning, and action at all levels. South Africa urged communication in a tabular format of: the type of contribution for 2021-2025 and 2026-2030; information on adaptation plans, actions, costs and investments; and MOI support. Chile, for AILAC, proposed that parties provide information on mitigation for 2020-2025 and an indicative contribution for 2030, including information on ambition, equity and fairness. On paragraphs 17-22 (post-communication and support for INDCs) , many parties, including China, India, Venezuela, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia, opposed consideration of INDCs post-communication. The EU proposed establishing an international process for the consideration of INDCs from the first quarter of 2015, which would be related to mitigation INDCs only. The US emphasized upfront information and a consultative period as important for promoting ambition and clarity. South Africa called for ex ante assessment of INDCs by the Secretariat through, inter alia , a technical paper on the aggregate effect of parties contributions. The Marshall Islands called for a technical paper summarizing and synthesizing INDCs, and including an aggregation of the level of mitigation effort. Japan and China called for a simple process through the publication of the INDCs on the UNFCCC website, with China objecting to compilation of INDCs by the Secretariat. The Russian Federation cautioned against the use of electronic means. Jordan, with China and India, opposed any ex ante review processes. Tuvalu, for the LDCs, proposed that Annex I parties report on their provision of MOI. Brazil stressed that consideration of INDCs is not a legally-binding process but a means to enhance the understanding of each other s intentions. On paragraphs 23-38 (guiding enhanced action on, and future work of, workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition) and basis for dynamic high-level engagement), the EU, supported by the US and Switzerland, stressed that the focus of workstream 2 should remain on mitigation. Many developing countries emphasized the need to also address adaptation and MOI. China, with Jordan, suggested focusing on how to increase international support to enhance action. Australia called for recognizing support to developing countries from various sources. Many parties described the Technical Expert Meetings (TEMs) as useful and supported their continuation. Nauru, for AOSIS, emphasized improving and extending TEMs until the mitigation ambition gap is closed, and indicated their outputs should include: updated technical papers; a dynamic online menu of policy options; focus on co-benefits of actions, barriers to implementation and strategies to overcome them; and a synthesis for policy makers. With Jordan, El Salvador and China, he said TEMs should focus on mitigation and adaption opportunities. Norway, with Switzerland, supported TEMs focus on mitigation, including fossil fuel subsidy reform, and, with Colombia, called for recognizing the work of the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate. Japan, supported by New Zealand, suggested strengthening linkages with existing institutions, including the technology transfer information clearinghouse TT:CLEAR and the CTCN. Norway emphasized the role of the TEC and CTCN in organizing TEMs. El Salvador suggested closer links with the Adaptation Committee and Adaption Fund.

AOSIS called for the TEMs review no sooner than 2017, with a view to their improvement. Canada supported review at some point. Switzerland favored a review in 2016 or 2017. Bolivia, India and others proposed increasing the scope of TEM topics, with Bolivia suggesting a focus on technology knowledge systems and practices of indigenous peoples and local communities. Colombia, for AILAC, called for engagement of indigenous peoples and academic institutions. India, Saudi Arabia and Argentina called for technical papers. Mali, for the African Group, suggested work leading to a technical synthesis and a summary for policy makers to inform ministerials. Many parties welcomed high-level engagement on the ADP. AOSIS, with China, Bangladesh, for the LDCs, and AILAC, called for annual high-level engagement. Brazil said ministerials should be held sparingly, when concrete policies can be proposed to them, and, with AOSIS and the EU, agreed to work on improving TEMs output. The US called for annual ministerials on pre-2020 ambition in conjunction with the COP. Brazil, Bolivia, Pakistan and India opposed contributions from sub-national authorities to high-level events. On engagement of a broad range of actors for effective implementation of enhanced action, Switzerland said engagement with non-state actors should take place at the national level. Tanzania, supported by Mexico, suggested that subnational entities and local authorities act through their national governments. Opposed by the EU and the US, Mexico, with Bangladesh, supported conducting, and offered to host, regional and sub-regional TEMs, with Brazil willing to explore this idea. Citing financial implications, Switzerland said such TEMs should be held back-to-back with other meetings. The LDCs called for support to enable technical experts from developing countries to participate in TEMs. Brazil, supported by Australia, the US and Switzerland, suggested noting health co-benefits of mitigation policies. The US proposed also adding economic co-benefits. Egypt proposed co-benefits in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication. On the annex (complementary information on INDCs) , Sudan, for the African Group, suggested consideration of mitigation, adaptation and MOI options with and without differentiation. Colombia, for AILAC, called for inclusion of information on why parties perceive their contributions as equitable. Panama, for the CfRN, requested that the role of forests be recognized and called for reference to considerations on bioenergy. Argentina, with Egypt, expressed concern over the inclusion of land sector emissions, noting that agriculture is not the main contributor to climate change. Tuvalu, for the LDCs, proposed differentiated reporting for countries with economy-wide emission reduction targets and developing countries, emphasizing means of support. On preambular paragraphs , the LDCs, opposed by the EU, requested deletion of reference to the global average temperature increase of 2 °C. Many developing countries, opposed by the US, supported references to the principles and provisions of the Convention. The US said annex-based differentiation is not a path to the new agreement and, with Japan, opposed bifurcated language. China, with Pakistan and Argentina, requested references to the BAP and, with Algeria, for the Arab Group, and others, to previous COP decisions. Chile called for reference to intergenerational equity. Jordan, India, China and Venezuela opposed reference to the catalyzing role of sub-national authorities in enhancing the impact of implementation of policies on reducing emissions and vulnerability, and building resilience. Saudi Arabia proposed acknowledging, in line with the IPCC AR5 SYR, that effective adaptation and mitigation responses will depend on policies and measures across multiple scales. The first reading of the draft decision on advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action concluded on Saturday, 6 December. First version of the Draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs : On Monday, 8 December, parties began considering the newly introduced version of the draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs. Several groups and delegates, including Malaysia, for the G-77/China, Iran, for the LMDCs, and Nauru, for AOSIS, expressed concern over: the lack of balance in the text; lack of adequate time for consideration of the text; and the danger of prejudging the outcome of the Paris agreement. The entire text was bracketed, following a proposal by Tuvalu, for the LDCs. On preambular paragraphs , Brazil, the US and others cautioned against extensive additions of text in the preambular paragraphs, and called for focusing on substance. Parties views diverged on referencing: principles and provisions of the Convention; previous decisions; temperature goals; guidance by science; principles of equity, common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities (CBDRRC) and sustainable development; mitigation, adaptation, MOI, and transparency of action and support; loss and damage; differentiation of the undertakings by different parties under the Convention; and a global emissions budget. Noting parties inability to move beyond some bracketed preambular paragraphs over a three-hour contact group session, ADP Co-Chair Kumarsingh emphasized that the remaining three days of negotiations are counting down. On a preambular paragraph on strengthening and scaling up adaptation action, Sudan, for the African Group, supported by Egypt, suggested adding references to the elements of Decision 1/CP.17 (establishing the ADP) and vulnerability of developing countries. The Philippines called for referencing the ability to recover from extreme weather events, and biodiversity conservation. Pakistan called for a reference to water security. Singapore, opposed by the LDCs, suggested deleting scaling-up of adaptation action, and the EU suggested replacing it with enhancing. Many preferred the original formulation. The US, with the Republic of Korea, Japan and New Zealand, suggested a shortened formulation making reference only to the 2015 agreement. Brazil, supported by Singapore and the US, said a reference to sustainable development should remain in the paragraph. Brazil and India also said that food security and poverty eradication are important elements that should remain, and, with China, called for specifying that poverty eradication relates to developing countries. On a preambular paragraph regarding the ultimate objective of the Convention requiring strengthening the multilateral, rules-based regime and implementation of existing commitments, the African Group, supported by Pakistan and opposed by the EU, preferred multilateral, rules-based regime under the Convention. China, opposed by Australia, proposed a new preambular paragraph noting the agreed outcome pursuant to the BAP and the Doha Amendment. On paragraphs 1-7 (advancing the work of the ADP and elaboration of a negotiating text for the 2015 agreement) , on a paragraph welcoming the progress by the ADP on the implementation of all elements of Decision 1/CP.17, Saudi Arabia, with others, supported the Co-Chairs text. Australia, supported by the US, New Zealand, Japan and others, proposed deletion of the reference to the implementation of all elements of Decision 1/CP.17, preferring progress by the ADP to advance its work. The US, with Australia, the Philippines, Canada, the EU and others, opposed by the LDCs, proposed progress made pursuant to Decision 1/CP.17. On a paragraph on welcoming the further elaboration of elements for a draft negotiating text in response to previous COP decisions, the LDCs, opposed by the US, Australia and the EU, requested referencing Decision 2/CP.19 (Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage) and, opposed by Saudi Arabia and India, further elaboration of elements as included in Annex I to the decision. On a paragraph on preparing a negotiating text on the basis of Annex I of the draft decision text, Cuba, supported by Malaysia, for the LMDCs, proposed acknowledging the work of the ADP and deciding that the ADP continue its work in 2015 to finish the elaboration of the draft negotiating text. Australia, supported by Switzerland, Japan, Norway and New Zealand, and opposed by the LDCs, suggested replacing on the basis of with by furthering the consideration of Annex I, and, supported by the LDCs and opposed by the LMDCs and Brazil, including reference to the ADP preparing any related decisions. Switzerland and Norway proposed adding without prejudice to the structure or content of the final outcome. The African Group suggested drawing on Annex I and submissions received from parties. On a paragraph on preparation of a negotiating text by May 2015, the EU, supported by Switzerland and the Marshall Islands, and opposed by the LMDCs and Canada, supported maintaining a reference to Convention Article 17 (protocols). The LDCs proposed noting, as appropriate, the requirements of Article 17. The LMDCs suggested that focusing on Article 17 could align us with a position we should not take at this stage, and, with the US, proposed noting any relevant timing requirements. Canada, supported by the US, preferred deciding that the ADP should aim to prepare a negotiating text instead of shall. This was opposed by the LDCs, who cautioned against slippage in timing. The Russian Federation, supported by Belarus, called for adding a reference to translating the text into all official UNFCCC languages. Relating to a paragraph on the scope of the 2015 agreement, the LDCs, supported by Nauru, for AOSIS, stressed loss and damage as a fundamental element. The US, supported by Japan, called for excluding reference to loss and damage, saying this was not an aspect referred to in Decision 1/CP.17. The LMDCs called for adding references to addressing in a balanced manner, with full legal parity all elements of paragraph 5 of Decision 1/CP.17. On a paragraph on the ADP producing the text of the 2015 agreement, elaborating any related decisions, for adoption by COP 21, and identifying the need for additional decisions at subsequent COP sessions, the EU welcomed the Co-Chairs text. The LMDCs opposed reference to any COP decisions. South Africa emphasized the need for the ADP to complete its mandate as early as possible and opposed elaborating decisions for adoption by COP 21. On paragraphs 7-23 (INDCs and their Communication) and Annex II of the draft decision (Complementary information on INDCs of Parties) , the US, supported by the Marshall Islands and opposed by the LDCs, proposed a new paragraph inviting parties to communicate their INDCs well in advance of COP 21, and those willing to do so by the first quarter of 2015. Brazil, with South Africa, said the addition of this paragraph was contingent on deletion of a paragraph inviting parties that are not ready to communicate their INDCs by the first quarter of 2015 to do so by 31 May 2015 or as soon as possible thereafter. Parties engaged in a lengthy debate on the time frame for communicating INDCs. Singapore, with Brazil, China, Egypt and many others, opposed by Switzerland, the LDCs, Canada, the US and others, requested deletion of by 31 May 2015. Switzerland preferred well before COP 21, with Turkey agreeing to before COP 21. The African Group, with China, for the LMDCs, and others, opposed by the EU and others, favored by the first quarter of 2015 and endeavor to do so as soon as possible thereafter. On a paragraph acknowledging the support being provided to developing countries for the preparation of INDCs, and the need for such support to be further enhanced, the African Group, opposed by the US, preferred some developing countries. The US proposed continuing need. The LDCs noted that some developing countries have not received any support and requested deleting to be further enhanced. The LMDCs proposed stressing the need for developed countries, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and any other organizations in a position to do so, to provide enhanced support. In a paragraph on communication of the mitigation component of INDCs, Norway suggested: adding reference to unconditionality of efforts by all, while maintaining a reference to enhanced efforts by developing countries made possible with provision of support; and recognizing the special circumstances of LDCs and SIDS, with the latter proposal supported by the LDCs, with some amendments. Saudi Arabia suggested bracketing a quantifiable mitigation component and, with Turkey, opposed reference to evolving national circumstances. The Russian Federation requested clarification of the meaning of actions and commitments. The EU insisted on commitments only. In a paragraph on parties reflecting, in their INDCs, efforts that they are able to make unilaterally, parties discussed the conditionality of INDCs. Norway, opposed by Mexico, suggested its deletion, saying the issue was captured elsewhere. Switzerland, supported by the US, preferred replacing unilateral with unconditional. Switzerland also suggested specifying that parties with less capability may also communicate enhanced efforts contingent on provision of support. The EU, supported by Japan, preferred referring to efforts that parties are able to undertake, instead of make unilaterally. Noting potential use of quantitative or qualitative methodologies, Brazil supported developing countries may also clarify the extent to which enhanced efforts are dependent upon the provision of support. Sudan, for the African Group, supported by China and Chile, and opposed by the US, preferred restating the extent to which developing countries implementation depends on the level of support. Chile suggested adding reference to countries most vulnerable to climate change impacts. Emphasizing the need for a component of unconditionality in parties mitigation contributions, the US recognized that the LDCs have specific constraints, but opposed referencing any other group. The LDCs, supported by the EU, suggested reference to paragraph 11(a) of the draft text (communication of INDCs mitigation component). In a paragraph on consideration by developed countries, starting in 2019, of annual quantitative contributions of MOI to support ambitious mitigation and adaptation action, particularly in those most vulnerable to climate change, delegates engaged in a lengthy discussion. Japan proposed deleting the paragraph, opposed by the African Group and Mexico, who underscored lack of agreement on the scope of INDCs. India, for the LMDCs, with Saudi Arabia, for the Arab Group, suggested: replacing starting in 2019, should consider quantitative considerations of MOI with shall provide, by the first quarter of 2015, information under Annex II, and referencing the provision of MOI to developing countries for a timely preparation of their INDCs. The LDCs preferred shall communicate their INDCs on support. The LMDCs proposed adding a paragraph specifying that developed countries shall also provide information on their annual quantitative provision of public financial resources for the post-2020 period for the implementation of developing countries post-2020 enhanced actions. Japan, with Australia, New Zealand and Canada, opposed including specific quantitative financial commitments, with Australia suggesting enabling environments, and not quantitative targets, motivate private sector engagement. Brazil noted that including private sector involvement in the new agreement does not ensure climate finance. The LDCs, with Brazil, China, the Arab Group, the African Group and the LMDCs, emphasized that submission of INDCs by developing countries is contingent on support. Brazil, supported by Chile, for AILAC, suggested that developed countries shall, in their INDCs, communicate their financial support targets, and policies and measures for technology development and transfer and capacity building, taking into account national circumstances. He also suggested that developing countries be encouraged to communicate South-South cooperation initiatives related to MOI in their INDCs on the basis of solidarity, common sustainable development goals, and national circumstances. The EU identified the elements text, rather than the decision on INDCs, as the right place to address climate finance. Emphasizing the need to address a variety of actions by all parties in the 2015 agreement, the EU, Switzerland and the US opposed language applying only to developed countries. Noting that the GCF capitalization resulted from the Cancun Agreements, the LDCs, with Malaysia, emphasized the need for a process on financial contributions beyond 2020. On a paragraph regarding communication of INDCs, Bolivia called for a framework to define fairness and equity in parties efforts that are in line with the global emissions budget. In the absence of these amendments, Bolivia, opposed by the EU and the Philippines, urged deletion of paragraphs 15-23 (upfront information and review of INDCs). The EU noted that INDCs are nationally determined and called for a rules-based approach that is multilaterally determined. Noting the focus on mitigation, Turkey, supported by Brazil, asked for all components, including adaptation and MOI to be included under INDCs. On paragraphs 24-36 (issues relating to workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition)) , Brazil proposed a new paragraph recognizing the social and economic value of voluntary emission reduction activities and the need to consider them as units of convertible financial value, in the context of paragraph 4 of Decision 1/CP.19 (enhancing pre-2020 ambition). He explained this was intended: to create positive incentives for voluntary and collaborative action; to promote a new standard of discussion ; to provide the political recognition necessary to develop related financial instruments; and not to relate to work under workstream 1 (the 2015 agreement). The EU and Colombia, for AILAC, said the suggestion was useful but should be analyzed later. New Zealand queried what this recognition would entail. China, for the LMDCs, and the EU noted that the paragraph s placement could suggest that the focus of workstream 2 is only on voluntary activities. On a paragraph urging all parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify and implement the Doha Amendment, Belarus suggested calling upon parties to consider the possibility of ratifying the amendment and to clarify all existing ambiguities that might hamper its implementation. The EU said issues around Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8 (methodological issues under the Protocol) should first be resolved. New Zealand, the US, Australia and the EU proposed deleting paragraphs on a Forum on Accelerated Implementation of Enhanced pre-2020 Climate Action. On a paragraph on convening such a forum, to review progress made in the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of Decision 1/CP.19 (implementation of BAP and enhancing pre-2020 ambition), in conjunction with SB 42, SB 44 and SB 46, South Africa preferred SB 43, SB 45 and SB 47. Bangladesh, for the LDCs, opposed holding it in conjunction with the COP. The LMDCs favored in conjunction with each session of the ADP in 2015. Brazil said there may not be enough time to deliver increased results on pre-2020 ambition. The LMDCs proposed launching an accelerated implementation mechanism and that it provide recommendations to COP 21 on how to further enhance pre-2020 ambition through the ADP. On enhancing the understanding of the status of implementation of mitigation commitments to accelerate pre-2020 mitigation ambition, the LMDCs suggested text on facilitating: the increase in developed countries quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol to 40% below 1990 by 2020; and the removal of conditionalities associated with such targets. On a paragraph on accelerating activities under the ADP workplan on enhancing mitigation ambition by undertaking an in-depth technical examination process from 2015-2020, Canada preferred technical examination from 2015-2017. The LMDCs requested referencing the workplan on adaptation with the leadership of developed countries. The EU proposed adding a reference to limiting the global temperature increase to below 2 ° or 1.5 °C, consistent with IPCC AR5. Nauru, for AOSIS, opposed 2 °C. The African Group, supported by the LMDCs, proposed that the technical examination process be facilitated by co-facilitators representing Annex I and non-Annex I parties, appointed by the ADP Co-Chairs for 2015-2017. AOSIS opposed a review of the ADP workplan that would allow for its curtailment in 2017. The LMDCs and the African Group, opposed by AOSIS, called for identifying opportunities for actions with high adaptation potential, in addition to mitigation, and, opposed by Australia, for text differentiating between mitigation opportunities in developed and developing countries. Bolivia, opposed by Australia, proposed adding reference to information sharing on the global emissions budget. South Africa, opposed by Australia, suggested developing reporting guidelines for initiatives and actors outside the Convention. On a paragraph requesting the Secretariat to organize a series of in-session TEMs in 2015-2017, AOSIS, supported by many parties, called for the process to be organized at least twice a year during the period 2015-2020 in areas with high mitigation potential. Brazil suggested adding options and instruments to areas. The LMDCs, opposed by the EU, suggested that a paragraph on identifying policy options differentiate between implementation in developed countries and support to overcome barriers to implementation in developing countries. On engagement of experts, the African Group called for reference to observer organizations. The US, supported by Norway and Canada and opposed by Panama, for the CfRN, requested removing a reference to the Warsaw Framework for REDD+, saying it is not a body under the Convention. Saudi Arabia, opposed by the EU, proposed that the TEMs also identify the negative impacts of response measures. The LMDCs called for emphasizing that TEMs should stay under the ADP. The EU said it did not imagine the ADP continuing beyond Paris.

AOSIS proposed an additional paragraph on assessing the implementation of the TEMs and making recommendations on increasing their effectiveness at COP 23. The US called for the TEMs review in 2016. The LMDCs preferred 2015. On a paragraph requesting the Secretariat to update a technical paper on mitigation benefits of actions, and develop a synthesis on thematic areas relating to mitigation opportunities and options for cooperation and accelerated action, Brazil suggested referring to mitigation potential, opportunities, options and instruments. Colombia, for AILAC, requested that a synthesis be compiled into a summary and presented at the annual high-level forum. AOSIS proposed disseminating the summary through a web-based menu on policy options. The first reading of the first version of the Draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs finished on Wednesday, 10 December. Second version of the Draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs : Delegates began consideration of the second version of the Draft COP decision proposed by the Co-Chairs on Friday, 12 December. In general comments, Bolivia, for the G-77/China, supported by Guatemala for AILAC, Tuvalu, for LDCs, Malaysia for the LMDCs, and Egypt, called for clear reference in the preambular paragraphs to the principles and provisions of the Convention, in particular CBDRRC. He also expressed deep concern over the lack of differentiation between developing countries and developed countries, referring to Annex I and non-Annex I parties. He also lamented that the issue of MOI, in particular finance, is too general and implies uniformity, calling, with China, for specific reference of responsibilities for support from developed countries to developing countries. He also called for clear differentiation between adaptation and loss and damage, and for strengthening the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage. Algeria, for the Arab Group, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo called for references to principles and provisions of the Convention. India lamented that the issue of strengthening the multilateral rules-based system and working with existing commitments is missing in the text. On upfront information for INDCs, Trinidad and Tobago suggested removing references to equitable from the text. Brazil, inter alia : described the text as the lowest common denominator; lamented it lacks ambition, finance, differentiation and a clear notion of no backsliding; and opposed the concept of self-differentiation implied in the text. Malaysia, for the LMDCs, lamented the loss of text after the revision, suggesting developed country parties, starting in 2019, should consider annual quantitative contributions on MOI to support ambitious mitigation and adaptation action, in particular for parties particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Nauru, for AOSIS, called for reference to the global temperature goal. Panama, for CfRN, called for references to the Warsaw Framework for REDD+. Bolivia opposed references to market-based mechanisms and the Warsaw Framework. Mali, for the African Group, requested new paragraphs: to address the lack of parties ownership of the TEMs preparation; requesting developed countries to present a roadmap to mobilize US$100 billion per year by 2020; urging developed countries to include, in their financial INDCs the time frame and periods of disbursement of post-2020 finance; and publishing developed countries communications to ensure transparency. Bangladesh said elements for a draft negotiating text should be reflected in an annex to the decision. The United Arab Emirates called for focusing discussions on paragraphs on which there is no agreement. On preambular paragraphs , on being guided by the Convention, recalling the objective of the Convention and also recalling all relevant COP decisions, India said the first sentence shutters parties confidence. India with China, Brazil, Fiji, the LMDCs, the Dominican Republic, Thailand and Venezuela, called for a clear reference that the work is not just guided by but is in accordance with the principle of CBDR and provisions under the Convention. He proposed an additional paragraph on consideration of economic and social issues, including just transition. Trinidad and Tobago called for a reference to the long-term global goal to limit temperature to below 2 ° or 1.5 ° C above pre-industrial levels. Emphasizing as a red line, Sudan, for the African Group, called for both upfront information and the post-2020 arrangement to be under the Convention. He suggested the preambular paragraph should recall the principles and provisions of Convention to provide assurance. Ecuador stressed the importance of long-term finance in the context of the decision. Nicaragua and Viet Nam called for a preambular reference to the decision being under the Convention. Fiji and Thailand requested references to the principles of the Convention. On the operative paragraphs , on a paragraph on the scope of the 2015 agreement, Nauru, for AOSIS, supported by Mexico, Bangladesh and the Dominican Republic, emphasized loss and damage as a separate element of the new agreement. The US and Canada opposed this, with the US saying they were prepared to accept the rest of the paragraph in light of assurances sought by a number of countries. Australia cautioned parties against reopening, in the context of the new agreement, a hard fought compromise on loss and damage that was reached in Warsaw. He suggested deleting reference to loss and damage, and adding, after references to the elements, reference to any associated institutional arrangement. The Russian Federation and Switzerland also opposed reference to loss and damage. Nicaragua, Solomon Islands, Ghana and Fiji called for having loss and damage as an element separate from adaptation. The Philippines, with Nigeria, emphasized loss and damage as critical, and said it must stand alone in the text and not be considered as part of adaptation. South Africa called for references to the 2 °C and 1.5 °C goals, and recognizing that the level of adaptation required depends on the level of mitigation. On a paragraph on intensified consideration by the ADP of the elements for a draft negotiating text reflected in Annex I, with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties before May 2015, Venezuela, with Nicaragua, opposed including the elements text in an annex. She cautioned, with Algeria, for the Arab Group, against precluding the legal form of the new agreement. The US welcomed an annex. Malaysia, for the LMDCs, expressed concern that the annex will form the basis for the 2015 negotiations. To preserve the progress accomplished in Lima, he suggested the Co-Chairs reflect this in their report of the session. On a paragraph noting that arrangements in the decision relating to INDCs are without prejudice to the legal nature of the INDCs or the content of the 2015 agreement, Sudan, for the African Group, stressed that both the legal form and the content of the Paris agreement should not be prejudged. On a paragraph on provision of support by developed countries and other countries in a position to do so, Guatemala, for AILAC, lamented lack of assurance on means of implementation post-2020. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates stressed the need for building trust and for greater clarity on scaling up finance by 2020. Marshall Islands said many developing countries see the scaling up of finance by developed countries as key to the Lima package. Saudi Arabia opposed the paragraph and suggested a spin-off group work on the issue. China, Brazil, Pakistan, Malaysia, for the LMDCs, Sudan, for the African Group, South Africa, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Iran, Nigeria and Cuba called for deletion of reference to other parties in a position to do so. New Zealand and Japan supported the paragraph, opposing its amendment. Mexico interpreted in a position to do so not as an issue of differentiation, but as opening the doors for countries like ours to contribute, and urged parties to find a way to keep those doors open. Given the concerns raised, the EU suggested deleting the paragraph. The US proposed taking the issue up next year. The Democratic Republic of the Congo said it prejudged the outcome of negotiations on finance. Egypt, supported by Brazil, proposed an additional paragraph to capture the importance of an agreement on scaled-up, new and additional, predictable, adequate and improved access to finance for developing countries to enable and support enhanced action on mitigation, adaptation and MOI. On a paragraph with three options relating to communication of INDCs, including their scope, Algeria, for the Arab Group, proposed its deletion. India, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Belarus, Cuba, Viet Nam, Iran and the Russian Federation favored the first option, in which the COP would reiterate its invitation to each party to communicate to the Secretariat its INDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention. Australia, Canada and Switzerland supported the second option, in which the COP: would reiterate its invitation to each party to communicate to the Secretariat its INDCs towards achieving the objective of the Convention and agrees that each party s INDC will represent a progression beyond the current undertaking of that party. Saudi Arabia indicated support if mitigation and adaptation were at the same legal level. New Zealand said it could support the second option as a starting point, and could look into a proposal to add references to adaptation, noting such references should not define contributions nor be mandatory. Japan said it was open to addressing adaptation, but not MOI. China indicated support for both the first and second options. The Democratic Republic of the Congo preferred the first option, but was ready to work with the second option by referencing contributions on adaptation and finance. Mexico, the Philippines, Sudan, for the African Group, Nigeria, South Africa, Malawi, Solomon Islands, Bangladesh, the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Korea and Fiji supported the third option, in which the COP would agree that parties INDCs will include a mitigation contribution, and may also include contributions on adaptation and MOI, and that the INDCs of each party will represent a progression beyond the current undertaking of that party. Nigeria suggested adding: INDCs submitted by Annex I should be ambitious enough in accordance with IPCC AR5 to result in emission reductions of GHGs equivalent to their total share of global emissions and be made a condition for entry into force of the agreement to be adopted in Paris. Brazil favored the proposal by the African Group. The US preferred the third option, but was willing to consider the second option, strongly supporting each party s INDCs representing a progression beyond their current undertaking. Panama, for CfRN, with the LMDCs, favored the second or third options, provided CBDR is recognized. The EU expressed preparedness for some trade-offs, including the possibility of including adaptation in the INDCs on a voluntary basis. Switzerland said it could consider adaption in INDCs if other key elements were brought in, including unconditional INDCs with quantifiable mitigation information and information on accounting. On a paragraph with three options relating to information to be provided in INDCs, Tuvalu, for the LDCs, called for referencing sections of the text on support. With India and Bolivia, he stressed the need to clearly indicate in the annex that MOI support is to be provided by developed countries to developing countries. India, China, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Viet Nam, Belarus, Iran and Algeria, for the Arab Group, preferred the first option, in which the COP would decide that all parties, when communicating to the Secretariat their INDCs, will provide the information necessary to facilitate the clarity, transparency and understanding of their INDCs. China suggested adding that the information parties communicate should be in accordance with Convention Article 12 (communication of information related to implementation) and relevant reporting decisions under the Convention. Australia stressed the importance of the paragraph and supported, with the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Switzerland, the second option, in which the COP would decide that all parties shall provide information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year), time frames and/or periods for implementation, scope and coverage, expected level of effort, and how the party considers that its INDC is fair and equitable, ambitious and consistent with the objective of the Convention. Australia suggested including reference to any assumptions and methodologies. New Zealand, supported by Japan, called for additional references to assumptions, methodologies, land use accounting approaches, and the use of market mechanisms. The US expressed willingness to work with the second option with the addition of references to assumptions and methodologies, fair instead of equitable, and parties INDCs representing their best effort in light of national circumstances. Sudan, for the African Group, said the second option could be considered, but required that all elements be covered and strengthened with a reference to the type and amount of MOI in order to establish parity with the required mitigation information. The Philippines, supported by Mexico and Ghana, called for reflecting human rights, in particular the rights of indigenous peoples and women. Mexico, South Africa, the Dominican Republic, Fiji, and Trinidad and Tobago supported the third option, in which the COP would decide that all parties shall provide information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year or other reference values), time frames and periods for implementation, scope and coverage, expected quantified outcomes, any assumptions, methodologies, land-use accounting approaches and expected use of market mechanisms, undertakings in national adaptation planning processes, and if applicable, the provision of MOI support for ambitious mitigation and adaptation action in developing countries, with special consideration for parties particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and how the party considers that its INDC is fair and equitable, ambitious and consistent with the objective of the Convention, and decide that parties shall provide the information identified in Annex II, as appropriate, when communicating their INDC. Brazil suggested replacing methodologies, land-use accounting approaches with methodological approaches for establishing and accounting for anthropogenic GHG emissions by sources, and as appropriate. On a paragraph calling for developed countries, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and any organization in a position to do so to provide support for the preparation and communication of INDCs, Tanzania called for separating what is asked from parties from what is asked from operating entities. On a paragraph with three options relating to actions by the Secretariat after the INDCs communication, including possible dialogues and an assessment of their aggregate effect, India, China, Brazil, Nicaragua, Cuba, Belarus, Saudi Arabia, Viet Nam and Bolivia favored the first option, requesting the Secretariat to publish the INDCs online, as communicated. The LMDCs expressed willingness to work on the language of other options. New Zealand, Japan, Canada, the United Arab Emirates and the Republic of Korea supported the second option, which requests the Secretariat, to inter alia : organize a dialogue between June 2015 ADP session and COP 21 with the objective of facilitating the clarity, transparency and understanding of the communicated INDCs and prepare a technical paper in advance of the dialogue on the aggregate effect of the INDCs communicated by parties prior to 30 June 2015. Willing to work with the second option, the US requested the dialogue to occur at every ADP session. The EU, supported by Tuvalu, for the LDCs, emphasized the need for a follow-up process to the communication of INDCs, and indicated, with Trinidad and Tobago, preference for the third option, which requests the Secretariat to: publish INDCs online as communicated; organize two in-session dialogues; and prepare a technical paper in advance of the dialogues, on the aggregate effect of INDCs communicated by parties prior to 30 May 2015. Mexico, Fiji, the Dominican Republic and Switzerland supported the third option, with South Africa calling for additional references to a compilation of, and workshops on, existing methodological provisions on LULUCF and REDD+. On a paragraph encouraging parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify and implement its Doha Amendment, Cuba and Viet Nam, opposed by Belarus and Ukraine, called for urging instead of encouraging parties. On a paragraph with three options relating to enhancing pre-2020 mitigation ambition, including a possible forum or mechanism to assess implementation, the EU, with the US, Canada, India, Australia, New Zealand, Iran, Algeria, for the Arab Group, Belarus, Japan and Switzerland, preferred the first option, suggesting the COP reiterates its resolve, as set out in Decision 1/CP.19, paragraphs 3 and 4, to accelerate the full implementation of the decisions constituting the agreed outcome pursuant to decision 1/CP.13 (Bali Action Plan) and enhance ambition in the pre-2020 period in order to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention by all parties. The EU, Canada and the US disagreed, opposed by Tuvalu, for the LDCs, with including finance in the INDCs, noting this issue will not be resolved in Lima. The LDCs stressed the need for an indication of finance not just for the preparation of INDCs, but also for their implementation; and also called for a reference to special circumstances of LDCs in the preparation of the mitigation INDCs. Mexico stressed the need for financial and technical support. India called for reflecting that elements for the draft negotiating text would be under the Convention. Mexico, China, Marshall Islands, Cuba, Fiji, Viet Nam, Panama, for CfRN, Bolivia, Saudi Arabia and the Dominican Republic supported the third option, in which the COP would launch an accelerated implementation mechanism to assess progress made in the implementation of Decision 1/CP.19, paragraphs 3 and 4, by convening meetings in conjunction with SB 42, 44 and 46. The United Arab Emirates preferred the second option, in which the COP would convene a forum to assess progress made in the implementation of Decision 1/CP.19, paragraphs 3 and 4, in conjunction with SB 42. The Democratic Republic of the Congo called for a hybrid option, preferring a forum that will take place not only in 2015, but also in 2016 and 2017. Brazil emphasized following a results-oriented approach. On a paragraph on actions by the Secretariat to continue the technical examination of opportunities with high mitigation potential in the period 2015-2020, Iran said it should cover all elements, not only mitigation. Saudi Arabia said TEMs need to end by 2016 or include adaptation. The Dominican Republic and Bolivia called for inclusion of women and youth as experts. Bolivia emphasized meaningful participation of indigenous peoples in TEMs, and called for a new thematic area on sustainable management of ecosystems, and consideration of additional areas for discussion under adaptation. On Annex II (complementary information on INDCs), Tuvalu, for the LDCs noted, with India, Bolivia and China, the need to clearly indicate in the annex that MOI support is to be provided by developed countries to developing countries. China and Bolivia opposed reference to fairness and ambition under the subheading other in Annex II, which addresses to indicators relating to fairness and ambition and their application. Egypt, Cuba, Fiji, Viet Nam and Sudan, for the African Group, opposed the annex. The Russian Federation cautioned against the level of detail in the annex. Brazil opposed the concept of self-differentiation and, with Marshall Islands, called for a clear notion of no backsliding. Venezuela stressed the need to reflect differentiation. Iran proposed deletion of the annex as it does not reference CBDR or a timeline on finance and MOI. Algeria, for the Arab Group, emphasized the need to refer to adaptation finance and expressed reservations on fairness indicators. The LMDCs preferred capturing it in the operative paragraphs.

## ADP ITEM 3 - ELEMENTS:

This item was first considered on Tuesday, 2 December and continued through Saturday, 6 December. On 2 December, ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger presented the non-paper on Elements for a draft negotiating text (ADP.2014.11.NonPaper) issued by the Co-Chairs in advance of ADP 2-7. On Saturday, 6 December, the first reading of all sections of the elements text was concluded. On Monday, 8 December, ADP Co-Chair Artur Runge-Metzger introduced a revised version, including a footnote to the title stating: These elements for a draft negotiating text reflect work in progress. They neither indicate convergence on the proposals presented nor do they preclude new proposals from emerging in the course of the negotiations in 2015. Many developing countries questioned the legal status of the new text, underscoring it remains a non-paper and that their concerns were not reflected in the text. ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger said it is up to parties to decide the legal status of the text. The elements text was not considered further during ADP 2-7 but is contained in the annex to the Lima Call for Climate Action, for consideration at ADP 2-8. Substantive negotiations took place on eight elements summarized below: finance; adaptation; mitigation; capacity building; technology; cooperation and support; transparency of action and support; and time frames and process related to commitments/contributions. Finance: Nicaragua, with many developing countries, opposed the text as a far cry from the Convention and previous decisions. On differentiation, Sudan, for the African Group, with Ecuador, for the LMDCs, and Bolivia, for the G-77/China, opposed text suggesting all parties mobilize climate finance through a diversity of actions. The African Group recalled differentiation between developed and developing countries under the Convention, and the responsibility of developed countries to provide finance. The LMDCs, opposed by Japan, called for deleting references to provision of finance by parties in a position to do so. India and China called instead for a reference only to developed countries and those listed in Annex II of the Convention. The LMDCs opposed reference to results-based adaptation finance. Mexico clarified results-based is not a precondition for access to finance, and stressed prioritizing both mitigation and adaptation finance. Indonesia highlighted the need to ensure adherence to the Convention principles in the entire agreement. Switzerland suggested including in the 2015 agreement: reference to each party rather than all parties mobilizing climate finance; some text on the purpose of financial resources; and applicable principles, such as being results-based, recognizing developing countries investment, and reflecting evolving capabilities and responsibilities. Bolivia, for the G-77/China, highlighted gaps in the implementation of obligations under the Convention and called for enhancement of support. Colombia stressed referencing leadership of developed countries in the implementation of the Convention. China and India called for deleting text suggesting that parties mobilize and provide financial resources in a manner which is capable of adapting dynamically to changing realities and future developments and needs. The EU clarified that evolving responsibilities and capabilities captures the growth in the levels of prosperity and GHG emissions of developing countries, noting that some are currently more prosperous than some EU member states. On policy signals and enabling environments, the US called for including text: encouraging parties to build effective enabling environments; calling for elimination of public incentives for high-carbon investment; and recognizing that climate finance flows in all directions. He suggested deleting reference to mobilization of climate finance as a means to stay below the long-term temperature limit, and, opposed by the African Group, to adequate and predictable funding for adaptation. Malawi, for the LDCs, lamented that text on encouraging policy signals by governments does not address provision of climate finance. New Zealand described right policies and enabling environments as a prerequisite for more effective flows of climate finance. On sources of finance, Norway, Switzerland, Canada and the US suggested highlighting a variety of sources. The Republic of Korea stressed the importance of operational guidelines, including: a balanced approach to finance, with equal footing for adaptation and mitigation; a practical approach for mobilizing finance from the public and private sectors; and creating synergies among different financial institutions. On the scale of finance, Egypt, with Paraguay, emphasized that adequate and predictable finance should come mainly from public sources. Algeria suggested that adequate and predictable funding for adaptation also be additional. The EU and Japan, opposed by Ecuador, considered specifying finance as adequate and predictable problematic. Egypt sought clarity on the scale of finance and supported quantified targets for finance to ensure predictability. Norway, the EU, Switzerland and Japan opposed an ex ante process to commit to quantified support commensurate with the ambition reflected in the adaptation and mitigation goals, with the EU signaling this as a red line. Colombia emphasized the need to capture predictability in the new agreement. Japan proposed deleting text suggesting that mobilization of finance be regularly scaled up. The EU preferred regular updating rather than upscaling. South Africa proposed to identify: how to anchor the existing finance mechanism and MRV system into the new agreement; the scale of resources required to keep temperature rise below our goal ; who contributes and how; and sources of finance. China called for acknowledging that South-South cooperation is not a commitment of parties and, with India and Algeria, suggested mobilization and provision of finance be enhanced not in coordination with, but rather as additional to, official development assistance. On Thursday, 4 December, Sudan, for the African Group, supported by Bolivia, for the G-77/China, Saudi Arabia, Maldives, India, South Africa, Ecuador, Zambia, Pakistan, Argentina and others, introduced a conference room paper (CRP) containing draft elements on climate finance under the ADP, requesting that it replace the Co-Chairs non-paper as the basis for discussion. New Zealand, with Switzerland, called for concluding the consideration of the Co-Chairs non-paper, noting it covers most of the elements of the CRP. The US emphasized work undertaken over the past two days on the Co-Chairs non-paper and progress already achieved. The G-77/China stressed the legal standing of the CRP as opposed to the Co-Chairs non-paper. ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger invited parties to consult informally on the way forward. This issue was not further addressed during the session. Adaptation: The US, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Norway, Canada, Switzerland, the EU, Zambia, Japan and others provided comments on, inter alia : long-term and global aspects of adaptation; commitments and contributions; monitoring and evaluation; sharing information, knowledge and lessons learned; and institutional arrangements. Saudi Arabia, for the LMDCs, Zambia, South Africa and others stressed the need to address differentiation. Switzerland said there is no need for differentiation on adaptation, noting that commitments are intended to facilitate preparation for adaptation actions without being burdensome. Australia and New Zealand opposed a bifurcated approach. Tuvalu, for the LDCs, cautioned against referring to contributions or commitments. The US proposed referring to actions. Brazil said work that has been done under the Cancun Adaptation Framework and Nairobi Work Programme should be recognized. The LMDCs favored the terms commitments and actions. India emphasized that determination of contributions should be country-driven. The Republic of Korea supported a global adaptation goal that is general enough to be applicable to all and specific enough to inspire action on the ground. Norway requested that an option for no global adaptation goal be reflected. Japan expressed doubt over a quantitative goal on adaptation. The US, Norway, Canada and the EU supported broadening the scope of national adaptation planning processes. New Zealand opposed a global goal on adaptation. The LDCs supported a long-term goal, noting that action on adaptation is dependent on mitigation and the global temperature limit. Ghana, for the African Group, said dimensions of the adaptation goal should be both quantitative and qualitative. The US clarified that universal individual commitments imply that each party will undertake enhanced adaptation actions to be included in national planning processes. Mexico said inter-linkages between adaptation and mitigation, renewed and reinforced collective commitments, national commitments, and adaptation finance should be reflected in the new protocol. She said monitoring and evaluation, and, with Norway, institutional arrangements should be addressed in COP decisions. Emphasizing that adaptation cannot be measured and quantified, Canada, New Zealand and Australia did not support linkages between the long-term temperature limit, the need for support and adaptation. Australia and New Zealand also did not support linkages between mitigation ambition, adaptation needs, the global temperature goal, and finance. Saudi Arabia, for the LMDCs, and Argentina stressed the need to link adaptation to MOI. On institutional arrangements, the US, Canada, Japan and others saw no need for new institutional arrangements for adaptation. Switzerland opposed singling out loss and damage in the new agreement. The LDCs proposed establishing: a clearinghouse to help those lacking capacity and access to the best adaptation technologies; a roster of international adaptation experts; and, with Timor Leste, regional adaptation centers. On MRV, Nauru, for AOSIS, supported reference to national communications and biennial update reports for communicating commitments, stressing the need to build on existing reporting modalities. Chile, for AILAC, preferred existing reporting vehicles that would not burden any country and facilitate North-South and South-South cooperation. The LDCs favored an MRV mechanism to ensure a level of support commensurate with adaptation needs. The LMDCs and South Africa cautioned against placing additional burdens on developing countries. China and Iran emphasized the knowledge gap on the implementation of adaptation. On loss and damage, AOSIS, the LDCs, AILAC, the African Group and others, opposed by Australia, emphasized that it should become a stand-alone element in the new agreement. New Zealand opposed any reinterpretation of Decision 2/CP.19 (Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage). The LDCs proposed a climate change displacement coordination unit, and a mechanism to deal with slow-onset events, including a compensation regime. The LMDCs said discussions on loss and damage are premature pending outcomes on the Executive Committee. Mitigation: On differentiation, Kenya, for the African Group, lamented the overall lack of reference to equity, CBDR, mitigation obligations of developed countries, and specific national and regional development priorities. India, Argentina, Venezuela, Jordan, Cuba and Bolivia called for reference to CBDR, principles and provisions of the Convention, or its Article 4 (commitments). Japan, New Zealand, the US, Australia, Switzerland and Canada opposed creating binary divisions on commitments, based on annexes or the distinction between developed and developing countries. The EU said the text should reflect that all parties will eventually take quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. The US called for an option in the text to update the Convention s annexes to reflect parties changing economic and emissions trends. The United Arab Emirates proposed recognizing actions by early movers. Saudi Arabia, for the LMDCs, described other parties comments on the evolution of CBDR, updated annexes or elimination of differentiation as illegal, emphasizing that the future agreement cannot be built on that basis. Supporting Brazil, China opposed the introduction of new concepts, saying diverting from the principles and provisions of the Convention makes progress difficult. On long-term and global aspects, Nauru, for AOSIS, suggested a regular review of the elements under the section on the basis of science. Saudi Arabia suggested using agreed language, for example from Cancun, and including references to, inter alia , sustainable development and developing countries vulnerabilities. China called for reflecting the linkages between the collective aspects of mitigation, adaptation and MOI. South Africa stressed a long-term goal should be consistent with what is required by science, and Tuvalu, for the LDCs, said the goal should be to keep the temperature increase below 1.5 °C. New Zealand suggested net zero CO2 emissions by 2100 in line with the latest science. The EU called for explicit reference to the 2 °C goal. Algeria, for the Arab Group, reminded parties that Decision 1/CP.16 (Cancun Agreements) recognizes the need for a longer time frame for the peaking of GHG emissions in developing countries. On mitigation contributions or commitments, Saudi Arabia said the subsection title should include actions. China suggested structuring the subsection so as to differentiate enhanced mitigation action by developed and developing countries. Chile, for AILAC, among others, supported the principle of no backsliding. Norway said elements on accounting and periodicity should be part of the mitigation section. The EU said all parties should submit unconditional commitments, with the possibility for the most vulnerable to also submit actions conditional on support. The US, with Australia, said each country should maintain a schedule of actions they intend to take to meet their commitments, with periodic reporting on implementation and revisions to enhance commitments. Bolivia, opposed by Australia and New Zealand, called for commitments based on an indexed global carbon budget divided among all parties according to historical responsibility, ecological footprint, state of development and capabilities. Brazil said agreement on criteria for carbon budgeting was difficult to foresee. Panama, for the CfRN, said that the global carbon budget should be informed by national estimates. Ukraine opposed considering a global carbon budget, preferring a bottom-up approach to long-term emission reductions. The LDCs called for two annexes, one for parties taking quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets and the other for parties that take other forms of commitments. The Republic of Korea supported reference to market mechanisms. Mexico preferred commitments according to CBDRRC and supported schedules as an anchoring mechanism for contributions. Ethiopia emphasized MOI for developing countries. The EU called for a commitment cycle of 10 years and, supported by the US, for a five-year cycle of review and revision. The EU said this should be elaborated further in the text. The Russian Federation cautioned that a review process in the middle of the commitment period could make ratification challenging, as legislators require a clear understanding of what they are agreeing to. On response measures, the LDCs, Venezuela, Argentina, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, opposed by New Zealand, Japan and Canada, variously supported a mechanism, institution or permanent forum. Ukraine preferred the option of no new arrangements, or a permanent forum as an alternative. Saudi Arabia said his country will not support the new agreement if it does not adequately address the issue. Cooperation and Support: China and Saudi Arabia said discussion on cooperation and support for implementation was not mandated by Decision 1/CP.17 (establishing the ADP). ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger explained that headings were only included for the parties convenience. Many parties supported consolidating the section on cooperation and support with sections on other elements. Algeria, for the Arab Group, and China said sections on market and non-market approaches, and new market-based mechanisms could prejudge discussions under the SBs. Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada and others said all parties in a position to do so should provide support for the implementation of the new agreement. The EU and Switzerland supported describing the purpose of MOI. Japan said parties who provide and receive support should work together to mobilize private finance. On differentiation, Singapore expressed concern over evolving responsibilities and parties in a position to do so, and cautioned against rewriting the Convention. The Arab Group opposed reference to evolving CBDRRC. China said only developed countries have the responsibility to provide support to developing countries, and cautioned against introducing new principles. On institutional arrangements, the Arab Group, with China, called for deletion of reference to sub-national, national and regional emissions trading schemes. Australia, the EU, New Zealand, Switzerland, the US, Canada, Japan and others expressed reservations about this sub-section. Panama stressed the importance of referring to the accounting and conformity functions of cooperative arrangements. Transparency of Action and Support: South Africa, supported by Mexico, proposed launching a process for discussing transparency rules during 2015, with South Africa saying this should be reflected in the ADP conclusions from Lima. On the scope of MRV, Argentina, with Tuvalu, for the LDCs, cautioned against bias towards mitigation. The LDCs called for greater parity between mitigation and support. New Zealand and Japan urged referring to transparency of support provided and received. Switzerland highlighted the need for adaptation reporting. Brazil said transparency cannot substitute accountability, and is linked not only to mitigation, but also adaptation and MOI. Turkey said the scope of contributions should remain at parties discretion. On the MRV framework, the African Group, warned against backsliding from the current framework. The African Group, South Africa, Chile, for AILAC, Panama, for CfRN, Nauru, for AOSIS, Brazil and Mexico called for building on the existing MRV framework, with some suggesting it could evolve over time. Nauru, for AOSIS, said the framework should measure progress toward a global goal of 1.5 ° or 2 °C and promote participation of all countries. The African Group cautioned against placing additional burdens on developing countries. Argentina, the LDCs, the African Group, Saudi Arabia and China, for the LMDCs, emphasized differentiation, with many calling for maintaining the existing two-track approach to MRV. Brazil called for a transparency framework that reflects differentiation. Ecuador requested a reference to CBDR. Norway emphasized universality and, with Switzerland, flexibility to accommodate parties different capabilities. Australia, Japan and the US called for a single transparency system applicable to all. The US said the system should enable verification of efforts, which could include tiers and opt-out provisions based on parties circumstances. Turkey opposed, calling for a common framework with common MRV provisions applicable to all parties, with flexibility for developing countries on the level and depth of the application of the common MRV provisions. On rules and modalities, the EU, with New Zealand, suggested that the new agreement contain high-level MRV and accounting principles, with guidelines and modalities elaborated in COP decisions. Argentina cautioned against prejudging SBSTA discussions on LULUCF and requested that various approaches be referenced in addition to markets. Jordan objected to references to market mechanisms. The African Group emphasized gaps in developed countries MRV frameworks on markets and LULUCF. South Africa highlighted the importance of LULUCF accounting, calling for consolidating detailed rules under the Convention. AILAC called for stronger language on developing rules for markets, land-use and forestry sectors. CfRN called for references to REDD+ and coastal ecosystems.

AOSIS and AILAC called for a clear definition of climate finance, with AILAC stressing this will help avoid double-counting. The LMDCs called for text on, inter alia : a common methodology for MRV of support by developed countries; a strengthened review of MOI support; and a financial channel under the GCF for MRV-related capacity building in developing countries. Technology: On commitments, Swaziland, for the African Group, Argentina and China called for differentiated obligations for developed and developing countries. Swaziland, for the African Group, said that commitments should not shift responsibility from developed to developing countries, nor encourage private over public support. China emphasized the need for developed countries to provide support to implement technology needs assessments in developing countries. On institutional arrangements, Swaziland, for the African Group, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Algeria and Argentina preferred anchoring institutional arrangements in the TEC and CTCN. China urged further guidance to strengthen the Technology Mechanism (TM), noting such guidance is complementary to anchoring the mechanism in the TEC and CTCN. Iran, Argentina and Algeria said that technology transfer should proceed under the principles and provisions of the Convention. The US said cooperative action to promote and enhance technology development and transfer should include existing technology and financial mechanisms. Ukraine requested inclusion of economies in transition in the development and transfer of technologies. Capacity Building: Canada and Japan said capacity building must be country-driven, and not demand-driven. Tanzania, with Tuvalu, for the LDCs, urged enhancing capacities of national governments to absorb financial and technological resources, and opposed reference to clear and predictable targets and outcomes. On commitments, South Africa and India emphasized developed countries obligation to provide capacity-building support to developing countries. Ethiopia emphasized glaring differences in needs for capacity building in developing countries and, opposed by the US, called for commitments on capacity building. Algeria, for the Arab Group, stressed that developing countries able to provide capacity can do so voluntarily. Argentina said parties should identify their own capacity gaps. The US said all parties in a position to do so should be invited to support others with lower capabilities. On institutional arrangements, South Africa, China, India, Iran, Tanzania, Tuvalu, for the LDCs, and others, opposed by Canada, Japan, the EU, the US and others, supported the establishment of an international capacity-building mechanism. India noted that mobilization of private capital cannot be one of its essential elements. Argentina said private funding should be complementary to public funding. China cautioned against board-shifting behaviors in reference to the potential role of the private sector in supporting capacity building. Stating that capacity development should apply to all parties, not only developing countries, the EU called for improving and strengthening existing mechanisms and arrangements under the Convention and the Kyoto Protocol that address capacity building. Time Frames and Process Related to Commitments/Contributions: China stressed the importance of the timing of the agreement, including precise dates for the starting and ending of its implementation, and a time frame related to commitments. On commitments/contributions, Turkey preferred contributions. South Africa favored commitments with a legal character. Chile, for AILAC, said that contributions should be communicated every five years, with an indication of contributions for the subsequent five-year period, as well as the five-year period following that. Indicating flexibility on period length, Switzerland, with Norway, emphasized that all parties should communicate their commitments at the same time. Turkey preferred a 10-year period with a mid-term review. On ex ante consideration, AILAC called for a robust process. Switzerland urged ex ante consideration of aggregate commitments. Turkey said the process should not be prescriptive. Norway said commitments should become legally-binding obligations once they are put forward through an annex or schedule. On formalization/finalization, AILAC said contributions should be inscribed in a document and cautioned against backsliding. Turkey and Tuvalu, for the LDCs, said contributions could be revised on a voluntary basis. The LDCs called for two annexes for: quantified emission reduction commitments; and emission limitation commitments and strategies. Australia said parties should be allowed to adjust their commitment/contribution on an exceptional basis. On strategic review of implementation, AILAC supported a five-year cycle and, with Switzerland, Turkey and the Republic of Korea, and opposed by China, said it should be applicable to all parties. Norway said review should harness unrealized opportunities.

## CLOSING PLENARY:

On Saturday, 13 December, COP 20 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal indicated that we are very close to building the basis of a successful outcome in Paris, expressing hope and trust that parties will work together to find the balance needed for moving the process forward.

ADP Co-Chair Artur Runge-Metzger noted that the objective of the meeting was to adopt results of the hard work, engagement and progress over the past two weeks reflected in the revised draft decision (FCCC/ADP/2014/L.5). Singapore reported on Friday s ministerial consultations, emphasizing a shared sense of urgency for progress and the need for trust in five areas:- the need for the Lima outcome to be under the Convention; - the need for balance in the scope of INDCs, which can include but cannot be confined to mitigation; - financial support needs to be available without backsliding on developed countries prior commitments; - the scale of ambition needs to be able to keep the global temperature rise under 2 ° or 1.5 °C; and - Lima s outcome should not prejudge the legal form of the Paris agreement or affect the Convention s firewall between developed and developing countries. Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, the EU, Belize, Chile, for AILAC, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Turkey endorsed the Co-Chairs text. Highlighting their willingness to move forward despite the lack of language on how INDCs would be on track towards the long-term goal, the Marshall Islands proposed forwarding the text to the COP for adoption. Urging parties to make progress now, the US said failure in Lima will put Paris as well as the future of UNFCCC at risk. He looked forward to an agreement that: is more ambitious than ever before; is built to last; applies to all parties in a genuine manner; is fully differentiated in terms of CBDRRC expressed in light of national circumstances; is built on the basis of rules-based accountability; and encompasses commitments to financial assistance. Sudan, for the African Group, Malaysia, for the LMDCs, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, India, Uganda, Paraguay, Pakistan and others opposed the text. The African Group stressed the importance of: the principles of the Convention; the concept of differentiation, cautioning against undermining it implicitly or explicitly; adaptation and MOI as Africa s priorities; and equal and balanced treatment of these elements alongside mitigation and transparency. Noting that the gap is closing little by little, Nigeria asked parties to address issues raised by the African Group. Calling the text unacceptable as it stands, the Democratic Republic of the Congo identified areas not addressed, including: parity among elements; differentiation; scope of INDCs beyond mitigation; and workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition). The LMDCs expressed disappointment that the text: does not recognize CBDR, and differentiation in INDCs and information to be submitted; introduces parties in a position to do so ; does not adequately address finance; is mitigation-centered; and prejudges the Paris agreement. Noting that the ADP text had divided the house, Egypt supported the LMDCs on addressing issues such as differentiation. El Salvador asked for one final effort to address CBDR in the text. Oman requested an amendment to the draft decision to reflect concerns of vulnerable states. South Africa, for Brazil, South Africa, India and China (BASIC), urged more time to address the balance between different elements, differentiation, and the assessment process for INDCs. Venezuela said the text has not achieved the necessary objective set for Lima and cautioned against renegotiating the principles of the Convention. Tuvalu, for the LDCs, said the text needed a surgery so that some vital organs, such as loss and damage, could be inserted. Uganda, Paraguay and the Solomon Islands emphasized that loss and damage must be an essential part of the decision and the future agreement. The Cook Islands expressed support for the draft decision. Asking for his proposals on loss and damage and human rights to be attached in the annex, the Philippines supported adoption of the draft decision. Singapore, China, Cuba and Nicaragua urged the Presidency to help find consensus in Lima. Algeria, for the Arab Group, called for a new text to be proposed by the COP President. Bangladesh asked the Co-Chairs to reflect specific concerns expressed by parties before adopting the text. Senegal asked for a more balanced text. Noting the lack of consensus on the draft decision, the ADP Co-Chairs forwarded the draft decision to the COP President under their own authority. ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger remarked that while some speak of a divide, in the Co-Chairs view, parties are united in the battle against climate change, but with different perceptions on how to move forward.

ADP Rapporteur Anna Serzysko presented, and parties adopted, the report of the session (FCCC/ADP/2014/L.4). Parties gave ADP Co-Chairs Runge-Metzger and Kumarsingh a standing ovation in recognition of their hard work. Pulgar-Vidal thanked the ADP Co-Chairs and announced that he would consult with parties to discuss possible solutions, and provide text to the COP closing plenary. ADP Co-Chair Runge-Metzger suspended the second session of the ADP at 1:31 pm.

COP 20 / CMP 10 CLOSING PLENARIES

## COP 20 CLOSING PLENARY:

On Friday, 12 December, the COP 20 closing plenary convened in the morning to adopt agreed items. The closing plenary was suspended at 1:18 pm. On Saturday, 13 December, the closing plenary resumed at 5:20 pm to consider the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage and matters related to finance. The closing plenary was suspended at 5:50 pm. At 11:37 pm the closing plenary briefly resumed for the introduction of the draft decision on advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (FCCC/CP/2014/L.14). The session was suspended at 11:53 pm for parties to review the text. On Sunday, 14 December, the closing plenary resumed and adopted the decision on advancing the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action, renamed the Lima Call for Climate Action at 1:23 am. Parties and civil society then delivered joint COP/CMP closing statements. On the Lima Call for Climate Action, India underscored the importance of clear references to under the Convention and CBDR, noting there will always be differences, and suggesting not leaving contentious issues to the end. Noting that the text manages to strike a delicate balance between very difficult issues, South Africa, for BASIC, said the outcome provides a solid foundation for work in 2015. Underlining work achieved in Lima as essential for the adoption of the 2015 agreement in Paris, Bolivia, for the G-77/China, stated the agreement must treat the elements of mitigation, adaptation, MOI, and transparency of action and support, in a balanced manner and on an equal footing. He outlined as five key issues for the 2015 agreement: the principles and provisions of the Convention, in particular equity and CBDRRC, and that the agreement be under the Convention; consistency with the Convention, including differentiation between developed and developing countries; adaptation and loss and damage; provision of MOI by developed countries; and consistency with achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication. Noting it had sought considerable flexibility and recognizing flexibility by other parties, the EU suggested that the initial capitalization of the GCF and the Lima Call for Climate Action provide a good direction towards an ambitious agreement in Paris. Saying that the decisions taken in Lima had set the stage for negotiations in 2015, Mexico, for the Environmental Integrity Group: highlighted decisions on guidance to the GCF and on long-term climate finance; noted that more work remained on market mechanisms and the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol; and expressed appreciation to the organization of the first session of the multilateral assessment, noting that the Independent Assessment Report and international consultation and analysis are important processes for promoting transparency and enhancing understanding of respective national processes. Many, including Australia, Nauru, for AOSIS, and Nepal, for the LDCs, expressed gratitude to the COP president, the people of Peru, and the ADP Co-Chairs for a successful conference. Incoming COP 21 President, Minister Laurent Fabius, France, congratulated Minister Pulgar-Vidal for setting an example of a great COP president with ambition, a listening ear and a spirit of compromise and for putting to rest the haunting ghost of Copenhagen. Brazil emphasized that a robust and ambitious agreement in 2015 requires continuous work, including on the nature and scope of INDCs and how they are to be incorporated in the Paris agreement, and prevention of backtracking. Observing a Latin American style of respectful multilateral diplomacy, Venezuela, for the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), lauded COP 20 and noted, besides Peru as its host, Bolivia s presidency of the G-77/China, and Venezuela s hosting the Social Pre-COP. China expressed gratitude for COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal s leadership and expressed confidence in parties to show ambition, confidence and flexibility in 2015 to ensure success in Paris. Panama, for CfRN, expressed appreciation for the inclusion of REDD+ in the outcome. The US thanked COP 20/CMP 10 President Pulgar-Vidal for his leadership, commitment and generous spirit, and emphasized the need for parties: to put forward their INDCs well before Paris and in a clear, transparent and understandable manner; and, to make progress on developing the elements of the 2015 agreement based on the working document coming out of Lima. Emphasizing the solidarity among developing countries, Malaysia, for the LMDCs, said we worked hard to recapture a lost balance in the text. He lauded as the spirit of Lima a restored transparent and inclusive multilateral process of negotiations. Chile, for AILAC, called for a collective commitment towards low-carbon growth. Lamenting the outcome as just another one of a series of decisions failing people and the planet, Climate Justice Now!, for ENGOs, called for climate targets within the global carbon budget and on the basis of CBDR. She declared: we are seeds and we are growing into a forest of resistance. Indigenous Peoples stressed the Paris 2015 agreement must contain operative language fulfilling the mandate from Cancun to fully respect human rights, including the rights of indigenous peoples, in all decisions relating to climate change, and called for direct access to indigenous peoples to financing through dedicated funds, including the GCF, and an active observer status in the GCF. Suggesting that the door to Paris is now open, Local Governments and Municipal Authorities said local governments need to be involved in the preparation of INDCs. Women and Gender called for a binding, ambitious and transformative 2015 agreement that upholds human rights, gender equality and the rights of future generations. Youth made a plea, on behalf of Pacific youth, for parties to help Pacific islands survive, stressing strong and effective loss and damage measures as non-negotiable. The Secretariat reported on the budgetary implications of the decisions taken at COP 20. The COP adopted the report of the meeting (FCCC/CP/2014/L.3) and a decision expressing gratitude to Peru and the people of the city of Lima for hosting the conference (FCCC/CP/2014/L.6-FCCC/KP/CMP/2014/L.4). COP 20 Vice-President Voto-Bernales gaveled the meeting to a close at 3:04 am, on Sunday, 14 December 2014.

## CMP 10 CLOSING PLENARY:

On Friday, 12 December, the closing day of the Lima Climate Change Conference, the closing plenary of CMP 10 convened in the morning to adopt agreed items, following the first part of the COP 20 closing plenary. The closing plenary was then suspended at 1:18 pm. On Saturday, 13 December, the closing plenary resumed at 5:50 pm to consider the election of officers and was suspended at 5:53 pm. On Sunday, 14 December, the closing plenary resumed at 3:04 am to close the session. The Secretariat reported on the budgetary implications of the decisions taken at CMP 10.

CMP 10 Vice-President Voto-Bernales gaveled the meeting to a close at 3:07 am, on Sunday, 14 December 2014.

# LIMA CALL FOR CLIMATE ACTION

In its decision, the Lima Call for Climate Action (FCCC/CP/2014/L.14), the COP:- reiterates that the work of the ADP shall be under the Convention and guided by its principles; - recalls the objective of the Convention; - recalls all the relevant decisions of the COP, particularly Decisions 1/CP.17, 2/CP.18 and 1/CP.19; - affirms its determination to strengthen adaptation action through the protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention to be adopted at COP 21; - recalls Decisions 2/CP.19 and X/CP.20 and welcomes the progress made in Lima, Peru, towards the implementation of the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage; and - notes with grave concern the significant gap between the aggregate effect of parties mitigation pledges in terms of global annual emissions of GHGs by 2020 and aggregate emission pathways consistent with having a likely chance of holding the increase in global average temperature below 2 °C or 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. In paragraphs on advancing the work of the ADP and elaborating a negotiating text for the 2015 agreement , the COP:- confirms that the ADP shall complete the work referred to in Decision 1/CP.17, paragraph 2, as early as possible in order for COP 21 to adopt a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties; - decides that the protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties shall address in a balanced manner, inter alia , mitigation, adaptation, MOI and transparency of action and support; - underscores its commitment to reaching an ambitious agreement in 2015 that reflects the principle of CBDRRC, in light of different national circumstances; - urges developed country parties to provide and mobilize enhanced financial support to developing country parties for ambitious mitigation and adaptation actions, especially to parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, and recognizes complementary support by other parties; - acknowledges the progress made in Lima in elaborating the elements for a draft negotiating text as contained in the annex to the decision, including a footnote that states: These elements for a draft negotiating text reflect work in progress. They neither indicate convergence on the proposals presented nor do they preclude new proposals from emerging in the course of the negotiations in 2015; - decides that the ADP will intensify its work, with a view to making available a negotiating text for a protocol, other legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties before May 2015; and - requests the Secretariat to communicate the negotiating text, referred to above, to parties in accordance with provisions of the Convention and the applied rules of procedure, while noting that such communication will not prejudice whether the outcome will be a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties. In paragraphs on INDCs and their communication , the COP:- notes that the arrangements specified in this decision in relation to INDCs are without prejudice to the legal nature and content of the INDCs of parties or to the content of the protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all parties; - reiterates its invitation to each party to communicate to the Secretariat its INDC towards achieving the objective of the Convention; - agrees that each party s INDC towards achieving the objective of the Convention will represent a progression beyond the current undertaking of that party; - also agrees that the LDCs and SIDS may communicate information on strategies, plans and actions for low GHG emission development reflecting their special circumstances in the context of INDCs; - invites all parties to consider communicating their undertakings in adaptation planning or consider including an adaptation component in their INDCs; - reiterates its invitation to all parties to communicate their INDCs well in advance of COP 21 (by the first quarter of 2015 by those parties ready to do so) in a manner that facilitates the clarity, transparency and understanding of the INDCs; - agrees that the information to be provided by parties communicating their INDCs, may include, as appropriate, inter alia , quantifiable information on the reference point (including, as appropriate, a base year), time frames and/or periods for implementation, scope and coverage, planning processes, assumptions and methodological approaches including those for estimating and accounting for anthropogenic GHG emissions and, as appropriate, removals, and how the party considers that its INDC is fair and ambitious, in light of its national circumstances, and how it contributes towards achieving the objective of the Convention; - reiterates its call to developed country parties, the operating entities of the financial mechanism and any other organizations in a position to do so to provide support for the preparation and communication of the INDCs of parties that may need such support; and - requests the Secretariat to publish the INDCs as communicated on the UNFCCC website and prepare by 1 November 2015 a synthesis report on the aggregate effect of the INDCs communicated by parties by 1 October 2015. In paragraphs guiding enhanced action on, and future work of, workstream 2 (pre-2020 ambition) and basis for dynamic high-level engagement , the COP encourages all parties to the Kyoto Protocol to ratify and implement the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol and reiterates its resolve as set out in decision 1/CP.19 (BAP), paragraphs 3 and 4, to accelerate the full implementation of the decisions constituting the agreed outcome pursuant to decision 1/CP.13 and enhance ambition in the pre-2020 period in order to ensure the highest possible mitigation efforts under the Convention by all parties. The COP also decides to continue the technical examination of opportunities with high mitigation potential, including those with adaptation, health and sustainable development co-benefits, in the period 2015-2020, by requesting the Secretariat to organize a series of in-session TEMs that:- facilitate parties in the identification of policy options, practices and technologies and in planning for their implementation in accordance with nationally-defined development priorities; - build on and utilize the related activities of, and further enhance collaboration and synergies among, the TEC, the CTCN, the Durban Forum on capacity-building, the CDM EB and the operating entities of the financial mechanism; - build on previous TEMs in order to hone and focus on actionable policy options; - provide meaningful and regular opportunities for the effective engagement of experts from parties, relevant international organizations, civil society, indigenous peoples, women, youth, academic institutions, the private sector, and subnational authorities nominated by their respective countries; - support the accelerated implementation of policy options and enhanced mitigation action, including through international cooperation; and - facilitate the enhanced engagement of all parties through the announcement of topics to be addressed, agendas and related materials at least two months in advance of TEMs. The COP also requests the Secretariat to update, following the TEMs, the technical paper on the mitigation benefits of actions, and on initiatives and options to enhance mitigation ambition, compiling information provided in submissions from parties and observer organizations and the discussions held at the TEMs and drawing on other relevant information on the implementation of policy options at all levels, including through multilateral cooperation, and to disseminate the information, including by publishing a summary for policy makers. The COP additionally:- requests the ADP to make recommendations in relation to further advancing the technical examination process, including the periodic assessment of the TEMs, to COP 21; - welcomes the Lima Climate Action High-Level Meeting convened by the COP President on 11 December 2014 and encourages the Executive Secretary and the COP President to convene an annual high-level event on enhancing implementation of climate action; and - notes the estimated budgetary implications of the activities to be undertaken by the Secretariat.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE LIMA CLIMATE CONFERENCE

Brick by brick my citizens, brick by brick.

 - Attributed to Roman Emperor Hadrian Arriving in Peru, delegates were welcomed by a decidedly positive spirit. As COP 20/CMP 10 President Manuel Pulgar-Vidal observed in his opening speech, prior to the Lima Conference, the world had received a number of good signals from the UN Secretary-General s Climate Summit, the initial resource mobilization of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), historic announcements by several major greenhouse gas emitting countries, including the EU, the US and China, as well as momentum generated from the IPCC s Fifth Assessment Report. This spirit of unprecedented optimism and achievement, as described by UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres, was expected to help advance work on a number of key deliverables intended to provide what ADP Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh referred to as a solid foundation upon which to build a new agreement to be adopted in Paris. In October, in an address to the ADP, Pulgar-Vidal indicated the outcomes he expected in Lima, including: a clear, structured and substantive text on the elements of the new agreement; defining the information to be submitted in 2015 as part of parties intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs); and a concrete plan for the pre-2020 period, including actions to ensure compliance with existing obligations, and the implementation of policy options with the greatest mitigation potential. He also emphasized the importance of confidence and trust in the process, as well as among parties. As many have learned from previous climate change meetings, no foundation for the future can be built without confidence and trust. This brief analysis will assess to what extent these outcomes expected from Lima have been delivered, the implications of the Lima Call for Climate Action for the negotiations towards the new climate agreement, and whether the Lima Conference succeeded in laying a solid foundation for constructing an ambitious global climate agreement in Paris, under which each country is able to find a room.

# LAYING BRICKS

A fervent facilitator and an invisible enabler, the Peruvian Presidency spared no effort in ensuring that time during the Lima Conference was managed effectively. With most formal negotiating sessions scarcely going over the 6:00 pm mark and the Subsidiary Bodies concluding their work unprecedentedly early, delegates were able to roll up their sleeves and get down to work on the building blocks for the new agreement, the draft decision text on INDCs, and enhanced pre-2020 climate action. Over six days, parties exchanged views on the Co-Chairs non-paper containing the elements for a draft negotiating text and made various proposals, which were all reflected in a revised document published on the UNFCCC website early in the morning on Monday, 8 December, by which time the text had swollen from 23 to 33 pages. Some worried that a proliferation of options, while indicating that the negotiating process is clearly party-driven, did not add to the draft negotiating text s clarity and structure, and could complicate future work. In the end, delegates agreed to annex this text to the COP decision on further advancing the Durban Platform with a disclaimer contained in a footnote stating that the elements for a draft negotiating text reflect work in progress and neither indicate convergence on the proposals presented, nor do they preclude new proposals from emerging in the course of negotiations in 2015. This disclaimer addressed concerns raised by many developing countries that annexing the elements text to the COP decision might preempt the legal form, structure or content of the Paris agreement and were therefore against formalizing any language that could potentially exclude some options from consideration in 2015, while locking in others. Limited substantive progress on the elements will no doubt put pressure on ADP negotiators meeting in Geneva in February 2015, which is expected to deliver a draft negotiating text for parties consideration later in the year.

# MOVING WALLS IN A DIVIDED HOUSE

Discussions on elements for a draft negotiating text and on the draft decision advancing the Durban Platform were both underpinned by a number of broad political issues. These included differentiation, the role of the Convention and its principles and provisions in the future agreement, and the issue of legal parity between mitigation and adaptation, on the one hand, and mitigation and financial and other means of support, on the other. Many delegates pointed out that on those issues the ADP had a distinctly divided house  - to the point that some felt trust among parties dissipating. The question of how differentiation will be reflected in the Paris agreement permeated the ADP negotiations. For example, most developing countries, in particular the LMDCs, maintained that there should be differentiation, both in the 2015 agreement and the INDCs, in accordance with parties obligations under the Convention, and reflecting the principles of CBDR and equity. On the other side, the US advocated differentiation in accordance with CBDR and respective capabilities in line with varying national circumstances. The LMDCs also strongly opposed the formulation parties in a position to do so in relation to providing support to developing countries for the preparation and implementation of their INDCs, and to providing additional resources to the GCF, the GEF, the Technology Mechanism and the Adaptation Fund, arguing that such language disrupted Convention-based bifurcation, effectively dismantling the wall between Annex I and non-Annex I parties. A related issue, namely that of legal parity between different components of the 2015 agreement, was also the subject of heated debate. Developing countries repeatedly cautioned against a mitigation-centric approach to INDCs, and urged for a balanced reflection of adaptation and means of implementation, with provision of finance taking the center stage. Of particular importance to AOSIS and the LDCs was that loss and damage be reflected as a separate element of the future agreement not only in the elements text, but also in the decision on the ADP. Parties inability to reach consensus led to the adoption of a three-pronged approach, including continued negotiations under the ADP, ministerial consultations, and consultations by the COP President. After the Presidency s consultations with negotiating groups that continued late into Saturday night - many hours after the Conference was supposed to conclude at 6:00 pm on Friday, the Lima Call for Climate Action was concluded. This outcome document, arguably, shifts the wall of differentiation. Although the work of the ADP shall be under the Convention and guided by its principles and the new agreement shall address in a balanced manner not only mitigation, but also adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, capacity building, and transparency of action and support, the ADP s commitment to reaching an ambitious agreement in 2015 is nevertheless described as reflecting CBDR and respective capabilities in light of different national circumstances. This formulation appears to open the door to a subjective interpretation of differentiation. Some also wondered if it modifies the interpretation of CBDR as reflecting historical responsibility, even if it avoids using the controversial terms dynamic or evolving. On the issue of parity, however, the final text provides some assurances to developing countries by giving adaptation a more prominent role in the future agreement and parties INDCs, as well as, and in relation to, provision of support. The Lima Call for Climate Action also refers to the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage in the preamble. Following the adoption of the decision by the COP, Tuvalu, for the LDCs, made a statement requesting that it be recorded in the report of the meeting. He stressed that the preambular text on the Warsaw International Mechanism, in conjunction with inter alia in the operative paragraph listing INDCs components, is, in the LDCs understanding, a clear intention that the new agreement will properly, effectively and progressively address loss and damage. While legally redundant, such declarations reaffirm parties positions and interpretations of agreed text, maintaining their relevance and visibility. During the negotiations, an additional concern expressed by developing countries, similar to the one raised in relation to the elements text, was that a COP 20 decision on advancing the Durban Platform could be prejudicial to the outcome in Paris. In this regard, the Lima Call for Climate Action explicitly states that the INDCs-related arrangements specified in it are without prejudice to the legal nature and content of parties INDCs, or to the content of the future agreement.

TEARING DOWN THE WALL? COP 20 was generally expected to help strengthen INDCs as a core component of the new agreement by clarifying their scope and specifying information required to facilitate their clarity, transparency and understanding. However, parties were also divided on their expectations for the text on INDCs, relating to information-related requirements, scope and communication. While the Lima Conference fulfilled these expectations to some extent, many parties and observers felt the decision has important shortcomings. The Lima Call for Climate Action succeeds in delivering on a mandate from Warsaw to identify the information that parties will provide when putting forward their contributions, by referring to quantifiable information, time frames, coverage, methodological assumptions, and a subjective evaluation of fairness and ambitiousness. However, by stating that INDCs may include, as appropriate, inter alia , these various aspects, the text fails to set a minimum level of common types of information to be communicated by all parties, thus significantly weakening the prospects of comparability across, and a meaningful aggregation of, contributions. A major area of divergence of views related to the scope of INDCs. This debate centered on the interpretation of the Warsaw decision, which states that INDCs should be aimed at achieving the objective of the Convention as set out in its Article 2. Developed countries interpreted this as referring to mitigation being the only component of INDCs, while developing countries insisted on the need to include adaptation and means of implementation as well, with developing countries providing information on their means of implementation needs and developed countries providing information on their financial contributions, as a precondition of enhanced action by developing countries. As a compromise between these two views, the Lima Call for Climate Action invites parties to consider including an adaptation component in their INDCs, which reflects broad agreement that adaptation action requires strengthening alongside mitigation. Parties were also able to agree on recognizing the special circumstances of LDCs and SIDS by allowing them to present strategies, plans and actions for low-emission development. Meanwhile, all other countries are implicitly expected to do something more. This latter aspect is yet another example of built-in flexibility, which translates into a lack of a clear requirement for parties to prepare a strong, quantitative mitigation component in their INDCs. Furthermore, in relation to the scope of INDCs, parties were unable to agree on any language on finance or other means of implementation, which left developing countries disappointed. Issues related to finance, therefore, remain a fundamental area for further trust building in 2015. Another issue on which parties disagreed was how INDCs would be communicated and what their possible ex ante consideration or review might look like. Many developing countries insisted that Lima should only focus on the process of communication. Some delegations, including the US, preferred a consultative process or period. Others, such as the EU and AOSIS, demanded a strong review that would assess the aggregate effect of INDCs against the latest climate science and what is deemed necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. Considered by some the weakest link of the Lima outcome, the decision text simply requests that the Secretariat publish the communicated INDCs on the UNFCCC website and prepare, by 1 November 2015, a synthesis report on their aggregate effect. This translates into an absence of any kind of ex ante review of individual contributions in 2015. Further, it also leaves parties with less than a month for possible upward adjustment prior to COP 21 in Paris in December 2015. Resulting from strong opposition by some, such as the LMDCs, to a review of their INDCs, this outcome left many disappointed. Some disenchanted observers, however, felt that, irrespective of its content, the decision would not have strong implications for global climate action, suggesting that the major factors driving the level of ambition of national contributions are in any event external to the UNFCCC process.

# RAISING THE CEILING

With regard to enhancing pre-2020 ambition (ADP workstream 2), the technical expert meetings (TEMs) emerged as an area where countries could find a common cause. Relating to the key question of how to carry work forward under workstream 2 beyond Paris, there was broad agreement that the TEMs, which have created a technical and less political space for discussions around scaling up implementation and which allow for bringing down the brick wall of the UNFCCC by engaging non-state actors, would be the proper vehicle. The Lima outcome sets out a clear process for building on the TEMs experience by providing guidance on their purpose, organization and follow-up, and seeking to further engage key institutions and mechanisms under the Convention. Views still diverged, however, on how to ensure the implementation of the Bali Action Plan, in particular with regard to the provision of means of implementation to developing countries, and enhancing mitigation efforts by all parties under the Convention. As a result, the final text does not include a proposed Accelerated Implementation Mechanism to assess progress made in these areas - an idea originating in the conviction of developing countries that developed countries leadership pre-2020, which currently remains insufficient, will be essential for both addressing climate change and ensuring a successful 2015 agreement. Discussions under the COP on long-term finance, which developing countries wanted to result in further assurances - such as quantitative milestones - on scaling up of climate finance by developed countries to US$100 billion annually by 2020, and beyond, were also disappointing to developing countries. Yet, an undeniable success was the initial resource mobilization of the GCF, which reached its target of US$10 billion, collecting a total of US$10.2 billion in pledges by the end of the Lima Conference from both Annex I and non-Annex I countries. While developed countries considered it a show of commitment and something they should be recognized for, developing countries felt GCF capitalization, together with the first biennial ministerial dialogue on climate finance organized during the second week as well as biennial submissions by developed countries on scaling up climate finance, were still insufficient. Some suggested that before celebrating the GCF pledges, they would first need to see how and whether they would translate into resources for the Fund. The first session of the multilateral assessment of developed countries mitigation targets, organized as part of SBI 41, reflected a similar divergence in views. Annex I countries celebrated the event for going beyond simple reporting, and increasing transparency and building trust, while some developing countries felt the process required further strengthening in the form of a clear follow-up, such as substantive conclusions for the SBI s consideration. Notwithstanding these differences and given the positive Lima Spirit characterized by an open exchange of views and transparency that persisted throughout the conference, these developments may have succeeded in raising the ceiling of pre-2020 ambition, and thus rebuilding some of the confidence and trust for the tough year ahead.

# ENABLING CONSTRUCTION

Many expected that momentum created by the political events of the previous months would contribute to an atmosphere of trust in Lima. These events included the GCF initial capitalization, the EU s announcement of its 2030 mitigation target and, in particular, the bilateral announcements by the US and China, on their respective mitigation targets for 2025 and 2030, as well as by the US and India, on expanded cooperation on climate change, including on phasing down HFCs. However, it soon became evident that too little time had passed for these external political events and high-level signals of change to translate into cardinal shifts in negotiating positions. Yet, some found discernible indications of a more immediate impact. For example, how CBDR and respective capabilities are defined in the Lima Call for Climate Action decision in light of different national circumstances, is a near-verbatim citation from the November joint announcement by the US and China. It remains to be seen if the ADP session in February will see further shifts in negotiating positions when parties have had the time to reflect on these events. In spite of parties arriving in Peru with different expectations and widely diverging views, at the end most felt that, in the words of the South African Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa, the Lima Conference managed to strike a delicate balance between very difficult issues and laid a solid foundation for work towards Paris. But did it really? The two key outcomes from Lima, the decision on Advancing the Durban Platform and its annex containing elements for a draft negotiating text, may have served to move the process forward and create a shared feeling of achievement and confidence in the process. However, given that key political issues, including differentiation and finance, remain unresolved, many parties are unwilling to declare the Lima outcome an absolute success. The year of 2015 will be one that defines the true significance of the Lima Climate Conference. Many wonder if the positive Lima Spirit can continue in the run-up to Paris. But perhaps more importantly, the question may be if the Lima outcome can enable the construction in Paris of a house where all parties can coexist, while keeping in mind that in this process there is one party that does not negotiate - nature.
