# QELROs

The negotiating group on QELROs, chaired by Raúl Estrada  Oyuela (Argentina), met for the first time in the morning.  Discussion focused mainly on budgets and differentiation.  On budgets, one delegation explained once again its  preference for the concept of the budget approach. A group  of countries opposed the concept, saying that there was  confusion between the terms 'budget periods' and 'emission  budgets.' As a way to alleviate confusion, one delegation  proposed using the term 'compliance period' within a  paragraph on timing for QELROs. A contact group was formed  to consider language to describe the 'budget/compliance'  period. There seemed to be increasing agreement that the  range for the initial 'budget period' should be five years.  However, further negotiation will be needed to determine  when it should begin.

The group also discussed possible parameters for  differentiation on the basis of a recent offer by one  delegation to be flexible on acceptance of the concept. A  country indicated that differentiation might be appropriate  if limited, and suggested a range of 0-5% as an example. A  regional group indicated that differentiation should not be  allowed to become a loophole. Concern was expressed that  differentiation might result in an excuse for inaction.

Canada submitted a proposal on QELROs consisting of a 3%  reduction of GHGs below 1990 levels by the year 2010. It  also provides for an additional reduction of 5% by 2015,  and indicates that the years 2010 and 2015 refer to the  mid-point years of budget periods. Canada's objective is a  protocol that provides for comprehensive coverage,  including sinks and six greenhouse gases, and maximum  flexibility in its implementation. Flexibility would entail  measures such as emissions trading and the banking and  borrowing of emissions budgets. Canada said joint  implementation with credits offers the best combination of  technology and financial transfer to developing countries  and expressed the hope that developing countries would see  its potential value. He also called for recognition of the  potential contribution of other measures, including the  export of energy with low carbon content.

Canada said that delegates must come away from Kyoto  confident that key developing countries, especially those  whose emissions are large and growing, will ultimately be  part of a processs leading to a solution. Developing  countries should take care not to feed ammunition to those  people who would cite their arguments as an excuse for  doing nothing. Canada stated that equivalency of effort is  an important objective if their target must be 'sold'  domestically. An acceptable way to appropriately recognize  national circumstances must be found, and differentiated  targets could be included. He said that while the EU's wish  to act jointly is understandable, he remains unpersuaded  that this approach would be equitable. A major problem  inherent in the EU 'bubble' approach is its allowance for  wide differentiation of targets within the EU, while  denying differentiation to others. The effect of future  additions of EU member states also presents a problem.

Contact groups were formed to discuss differentiation and  the number of gases to be covered by the legal instrument  (coverage). The QELROs group continued its deliberations on  gas coverage and sinks in an evening session.

# INSTITUTIONS AND MECHANISMS

The working group on institutions and mechanisms convened  in the morning and early evening. The Chair, Takao Shibata  (Japan), identified a number of items in need of further  consideration: the Meeting of the Parties, entry into  force, and compliance. Having identified the key  outstanding issues, Chair Shibata set up an informal  contact group that will be chaired by Patrick Szell (UK).  After its first meeting in the afternoon, the contact group  reported some progress on the article dealing with the  Meeting of the Parties and was expected to reconvene for  further deliberation. Discussion was based on G-77/China  proposals tabled at AGBM-8 in Bonn. The contact group  discussed the inter-relationship between the Meeting of the  Parties (MOP) and the Conference of the Parties, the way in  which the article on the MOP should refer to the review of  the adequacy of commitments under the FCCC, and other  outstanding issues.

# ARTICLE 4.1

Participants reported little movement in the negotiating  group on advancing the implementation of FCCC Article 4.1  (Article 12 in the negotiating text), which is being co- chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Bo Skjellén  (Sweden). Industrialized nations favored alternative text  under which all Parties would, inter alia, implement  national and regional programmes containing measures to  mitigate climate change and facilitate adequate adaptation.  Developing countries preferred an alternative stating that  developed countries shall incorporate QELROs and P&Ms into  their national programmes. Developed countries would also  specify measure taken to finance technology transfer,  provide financial resources and assist in meeting the costs  of adaptation.

Some delegates expressed concern over who would bear the  costs of proposals to, inter alia, formulate programmes to  improve protection measures for infrastructure and deploy  adaptation technologies. On Article 13 (financial  resources), some developing countries objected to bracketed  language that would have financial resources to meet their  full agreed costs provided [through the mechanism defined  by the Convention].

# CONSULTATIONS ON SINKS

The contact group on sinks chaired by Antonio la Viña  (Philippines) met in the morning to discuss a Chair's draft  on sinks. The draft would set QELROs on gross emissions and  measure compliance with net emissions. It refers to  'verifiable changes . . . resulting from direct human  induced land-use change and forestry activities since 1990'  to achieve compliance. The sinks would be limited to a  verifiable change in stocks covered in the land-use change  and forestry sector of the IPCC guidelines.

Delegates reiterated divergent, previously stated positions  about whether or how to include sinks in QELROs. They  debated the meaning of a number of terms included in the  Chair's draft, with some noting that 'new' and 'direct'  appeared vague. Concern was also raised with the reference  to 1990 as a base year. No agreement was reached, and the  contact group resumed an evening session to develop  recommendations to the QELROs negotiating group.

# PRESS BRIEFINGS

### CHAIR OF THE COW

COW Chair Raúl Estrada Oyuela reported  there had been some progress in the discussions and noted  Canada's official presentation of its targets. He also  noted discussions on target years versus budget periods,  whereby targets are established either as a percentage of  reduction for specific years or for a number of years. He  said problems with transparency and flexibility will need  further consideration.

On differentiation, he recalled that there has been a  longstanding discussion of flat rate versus differentiated  reductions among countries and noted that the difficulty  arises in deciding what criteria to use for  differentiation. He said Parties have been choosing targets  that best suit their needs and much work is needed to make  them compatible. He expressed concern that when  differentiation is discussed, proposed reduction goals  'will go to the floor, not the ceiling.' He noted that no  Party has yet said it would reduce more than the others.

When asked if delegates had discussed the 'evolution' of  the Convention, Estrada said the item has not been assigned  to the COW. He cautioned that FCCC Article 4.1 contains  commitments for all Parties, and the question refers to  quantified commitments with regard to emissions. He said  quantitative commitments will come in due time for  developing countries. When asked if differentiation could  be settled in the short time remaining, Estrada noted that  many Parties already have a clear position on what they  intend to do. He also noted that there was a tendency  toward multiple year targets.

### OTHER PRESS BRIEFINGS

The G-77/China, the European  Community (EC), Japan, the US and Canada were among those  giving press briefings. The G-77/China reiterated the need  to preserve the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities as defined in the FCCC and indicated that  the US proposal on 'voluntary but binding' commitments for  developing countries counter to this principle.

The EC said that there was growing consensus regarding a 5- year time frame for 'budget periods,' but indicated that  further consultations were needed to determine when the  first budget period would begin. He spoke of  differentiation based on a 0 - 5% range of reductions of  emissions. However, he indicated that the EU was not in a  position to accept this range because a ministerial  decision would be needed to change the QELROs target it had  set for itself.

The Japanese briefing emphasized that differentiation  should acknowledge equivalence of efforts by different  countries, and that additional criteria could be discussed  within that framework. He pointed out that the 'floor to  ceiling' differentiation of 0 - 5% that had been discussed  reflected the Japanese proposal. The US indicated that  joint implementation with credits is a least-cost win-win  solution.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Observers noted increasing efforts by the United States and  others to attack the European Union's positions,  particularly on QELROs and the 'bubble.' The aggressive  tone was joined in the corridors by comments that the EU  could not sustain a 15 percent target were it not for large  emissions reductions unmotivated by climate change concerns  and its refusal so far to address all gases. EU  representatives called the critique of the bubble 'a  tactic,' but some NGOs said the vehemence of the criticisms  compelled them to come to the EU's defense because, they  said, the EU wasn't defending itself. Some observers  suggested that a greater threat to the EU's coordination of  a group position may be ongoing informal courtship of some  EU members by proponents of competing QELROs proposals.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

A day after the US' expression of interest in  differentiation, this hurdle to an agreement may be  receding in discussions within the QELROs group. Some  participants say that a narrow band of differentiation  could make deeper cuts palatable for some countries,  resulting in a greater aggregate reduction in global  emissions than otherwise possible. Others would be  satisfied if it at least makes it possible to reach an  agreement that all countries can live with. Some  participants worried, however, about the impact of an  agreement based on differentiated targets. Pleas were heard  that differentiation not become a loophole, as was the fear  that providing a 'floor to ceiling' range would encourage  countries to head for the floor.

# IN THE CORRIDORS III

News that Al Gore is to fly into Kyoto Sunday was greeted  with speculation about the significance of the Vice  President's attendance for the US negotiating position.  Optimists were quick to suggest that Gore would be unlikely  to attend the COP only to defend the current US target for  stabilisation by 1990. Instead, they argued, the visit  suggested he might preside over an improved offer on GFG  reduction targets. Noting that Gore would spend only eight  hours in Kyoto, an NGO observer said she did not believe  the Vice President would negotiate.
