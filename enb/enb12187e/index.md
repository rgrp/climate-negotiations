# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

### STATEMENTS BY UN BODIES AND SPECIALIZED AGENCIES

The High-Level  Segment opened with statements by UN bodies and specialized  agencies. The WMO highlighted the IPCC's Third Assessment Report  (TAR), noting new and stronger evidence of the contribution of  human activities to climate change. UNEP urged ratification of the  Protocol prior to the World Summit on Sustainable Development  (WSSD) and underlined the need to address the two global crises of  ecological degradation and extreme poverty. The GEF: underlined  its commitment to supporting capacity building, technology  transfer and adaptation; acknowledged the need for a more  consultative process in the GEF Council; and undertook to address  the concerns raised in the recent evaluation of its performance.  Emphasizing the links between development and climate change, the  UNDP noted, inter alia, that its country-office presence is being  reinforced. UNITAR outlined its various training and networking  activities relating to climate change. The CCD highlighted the  importance of improving synergies between the Rio Conventions. The  IPCC summarized key findings of the TAR, noting that developing  countries will suffer disproportionate impacts, and highlighted  the existence of barriers to more widespread implementation of  technological adaptation and mitigation options.

### WELCOMING CEREMONY

Following these statements, an official  welcoming ceremony was held. UNEP Executive Director Klaus TÃ¶pfer  delivered a speech on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,  in which he: highlighted the environment and development elements  of climate change; noted the need for significant long-term  changes in social and economic behaviors; expressed appreciation  for the work of COP-6 President Pronk, noting that Pronk would  serve as his special envoy to the WSSD; and underlined the  importance of multilateralism.

Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco, speaking on behalf of King  Mohammed VI, underlined the need for internationally-shared  ethical values, and urged that 'hatred and rejection of the  'other' must not be reduced and oversimplified by a vision that is  blurred by emotion on the spur of the moment to the extent that it  divides the world by concentrating the 'good guys' on just one  side of it.'  Urging international solidarity in addressing  environmental concerns, he called for technology transfer, new and  additional financial resources, and reducing external debt  burdens.

### STATEMENTS BY YOUTH REPRESENTATIVES

On Wednesday afternoon,  MOROCCO'S CHILDREN'S PARLIAMENT, FRANCOPHONE YOUNG PEOPLE'S  PARLIAMENT, and the WORLD YOUTH ORGANIZATION ON CLIMATE CHANGE  gave presentations, with the final speaker urging a move toward a  low carbon-emitting future, entry into force of the Protocol as  the start of a 'long path' in combating climate change, and  completion at COP-7 of decision texts without weakening the Bonn  Agreements.

### STATEMENT BY UNFCCC EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

In his final speech in a  high-level segment, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit  Cutajar congratulated the Secretariat staff on their dynamism and  commitment, and thanked Parties for their trust and for not  engaging in micro-management. Noting that this treaty relates to  sustainable development of the global economy as well as climate  change, he wished delegates well in moving the UNFCCC forward.  Delegates thanked him for his contribution with a standing  ovation.

### STATEMENTS BY PARTIES

Forty-four ministers and heads of  delegation made statements. Many speakers highlighted the  importance of maintaining the environmental integrity of the  Protocol. Parties also drew attention to success on Tuesday in  negotiations on compliance, and called for completion at COP-7 of  work under the Buenos Aires Plan of Action, with many stating that  this would support ratification and entry into force in time for  the WSSD in September 2002. In addition, several speakers noted  that the events of 11 September demonstrate the need for  multilateral solutions to global problems that cannot be tackled  by just one country. A number of delegates drew attention to the  IPCC TAR, which demonstrates the need for urgent action to address  climate change, and paid tribute to both COP-6 President Pronk and  UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar.

On the current negotiations at COP-7, SWITZERLAND said it could  not accept changes that weaken the Bonn Agreements, and stated  that no country can shirk its responsibilities, especially if it  is a major country in the ratification process. IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, underscored its approach of 'principled flexibility,'  and stated that neither COP-7 nor the WSSD was the appropriate  forum for raising the issue of new commitments for developing  countries. BELGIUM, for the EU, highlighted outstanding issues on  the mechanisms requiring resolution, including the election of the  Executive Board of the CDM. BULGARIA, for CG-11, CYPRUS and MALTA,  noted the special circumstances of these individual countries in  fulfilling their commitments. CANADA highlighted the need to be  responsive to those whose participation is critical to entry into  force of the Protocol. SWEDEN said success in Marrakesh would  constitute a powerful pledge for the US to reconsider its decision  to be part of a global coalition to combat climate change.

On mechanisms, JAPAN cautioned against too many constraints on  their use. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said the full potential of the  mechanisms should be realized, including unilateral CDM. UKRAINE  said JI should be given priority and that the main goal should be  the reduction, rather than the redistribution, of emissions. On  LULUCF, CHINA cautioned against any loopholes.

Regarding the circumstances and needs of developing countries and  LDCs, many speakers underscored the need for capacity building,  adaptation and technology transfer. IRELAND and NORWAY highlighted  linkages between climate change and poverty. CHINA underlined the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and  SENEGAL stressed the value of NAPAs and called for greater  commitment to the LDC Fund.

On next steps in the climate change process, SAMOA, for AOSIS,  said that once work on the BAPA is completed, Parties should  review commitments under this regime, and suggested that they be  stronger and more extensive. The US said it would continue to play  a leading role in addressing climate change and is moving ahead  with science-based measures. BRAZIL said it looked forward to  negotiations on the second commitment period, taking into account  the 'Brazilian proposal' based on the share of responsibility for  causing climate change. INDIA said it was considering the  possibility of hosting COP-8.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The negotiating group on Articles 5,  7 and 8 met in afternoon and evening sessions. Chair Dovland  informed participants of an agreement with the mechanisms group  that a separate decision would be issued on Article 7.4 (assigned  amounts), with some aspects of the current work on Articles 5, 7  and 8 being covered under this decision.

Noting completion of negotiations on compliance, Chair Dovland  made a proposal regarding all issues related to Article 3.14  (adverse effects) whereby reporting problems would not trigger  loss of mechanisms' eligibility. JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and CANADA  expressed concern with suggested mandatory language on reporting  of Article 3.14 implementation. Participants were unable to agree  on the proposal and the issue was deferred to ministers.

On reporting on P&Ms in accordance with Article 2.3 (adverse  effects of P&Ms) in the draft Article 7 guidelines, Chair Dovland  recalled an earlier proposal to delete reference to future COP and  COP/MOP decisions, and Parties agreed to this.

Delegates then discussed at length three options on the  composition of the expert review teams (ERTs). Chair Dovland  proposed adopting an option requesting the Secretariat to select  ERT members with a view to achieving balance between experts from  Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, without compromising skills  requirements. This was supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EU,  JAPAN, and AUSTRALIA. The G-77/CHINA said he needed to consult  further within the group, and no agreement was reached.

JAPAN said the issue of reporting on supplementarity relating to  mechanisms should be forwarded to ministers for consideration.  CHINA highlighted its proposed paragraph specifying the aim of  reducing per capita emissions differences between developed and  developing countries. The EU noted problems with such reporting,  including lack of relevant developing country data. JAPAN,  AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the US opposed the paragraph due to the lack  of legal context.

Regarding reporting on Article 4 (joint fulfillment), delegates  reported that consultations were ongoing, and the issue was left  unresolved.

JAPAN introduced draft COP-7 decision text on its proposal on  review for reinstatement of eligibility, requesting SBSTA to take  further action. Delegates expressed concern with annexed guideline  elements and a proposed ten-week timeline for expedited review.  Returning later to the issue, JAPAN stressed the key importance he  attaches to the issue. The EU, opposed by the G-77/CHINA,  indicated that he could agree to the proposal with minor  amendments. The proposal was bracketed in its entirety.

On confidentiality, a drafting group was convened to resolve the  issue Thursday. Chair Dovland concluded by expressing 'extreme  disappointment' at the lack of progress in the group.

### MECHANISMS

Secretary of State Philippe Roch (Switzerland) and  Minister Valli Moosa (South Africa) facilitated consultations with  various regional groups on the mechanisms negotiating group Co- Chairs' new non-paper. Discussions reportedly focused on, inter  alia, eligibility and reporting on sinks, and carry over of units.

### LDCS

In the contact group's final meeting, Chair Gamede noted the  three draft proposals under consideration for adoption relating  to: the guidelines for the preparation of NAPAs and their annex;  establishment of an LDC Expert Group; and guidance on the  operation of the LDC Fund. The US stressed a package deal on all  three texts, and said they should remain bracketed in their  entirety. All other Parties supported removing the brackets. The  US said this matter should be decided by ministers, and the  entirely bracketed texts were forwarded to the SBI.

The draft proposal on the status of the implementation of UNFCCC  Article 4.9 (LDCs) was agreed with brackets remaining around the  reference to the three other decisions on LDCs, at the request of  the US. The draft proposal will be forwarded to the SBI.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates came down to earth Wednesday as the euphoria with the  success on compliance turned to frustration over Article 7.4 and  other mechanisms issues. One issue apparently of concern to some  delegates was the fact that the actual text on Article 7.4 had not  been made available during high-level consultations. However,  others suggested this might be an effective strategy at this point  in time. Meanwhile, reinstatement of eligibility requirements  emerged as a key area of controversy, as the issue, which already  was a fundamental element of the compliance package deal, was  taken up in talks on Articles 5, 7 and 8. There was also talk of a  new document on input to the WSSD that would be circulated  Thursday.
