# OPENING PLENARY

COP-6 President Jan Pronk opened COP-7 on Monday morning.  Suggesting that the events of 11 September had cast international  agreements in a new light, he said the Bonn Agreements demonstrate  the effectiveness of multilateralism and international cooperation  in solving global problems within the framework of the UN. He  expressed confidence that COP-7 will complete the process of  translating the Bonn Agreements into legal language, and bring  work on the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) to a successful  conclusion.

The COP then elected Mohamed Elyazghi, Morocco's Minister of  Territory Planning, Urban Management, Housing and Environment, as  COP-7 President. President Elyazghi welcomed delegates to Morocco,  adding that this was the first UNFCCC COP to be held in Africa. He  thanked COP-6 President Pronk for his perseverance and for leaving  an 'indelible mark' on the process.

Abdelaziz Sa√¢di, President of the Regional Council of Marrakesh,  presented the best wishes of Mohamed VI, King of Morocco, for a  successful conference, and noted that COP-7 offered an opportunity  to make significant progress in facilitating effective action in  combating climate change. Omar Jazouli, President of the Urban  Community of Marrakesh, outlined efforts to preserve and protect  the green heritage of Marrakesh, as well as projects to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions in the waste treatment and transportation  sectors.

Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, said  the Bonn Agreements represented a significant move forward in  negotiations and a breakthrough for multilateralism. He suggested  that successes at COP-7 could include the start of the CDM on a  solid basis and giving special consideration to the needs of  African countries.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

President Elyazghi noted that 42 Parties  had so far ratified the Protocol and called on the remaining  Parties to do so in time for the World Summit on Sustainable  Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg in 2002. On the rules of  procedure, the COP decided to continue applying the draft rules,  with the exception of rule 42 (voting). Participants then adopted  the agenda, with the exception of the item 'second review of the  adequacy of UNFCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b)' (review of  commitments), which is to be addressed in informal consultations.  The election of officers other than the President was postponed  pending consultations. On the organization of work, the COP  decided that delegates would resume in three negotiating groups  dealing with the mechanisms, compliance, and Protocol Articles 5  (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8  (review of information), and that informal consultations would be  held on LULUCF and, if necessary, on P&Ms. UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Cutajar drew attention to a proposal by the group of  Central Asia, Caucasus and Moldova to replace the term 'developing  countries' with 'developing countries and other Parties not  included in Annex I' throughout the draft decisions.

### PARTIES' OPENING STATEMENTS

Many Parties thanked UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Cutajar, COP-6 President Pronk, and the Secretariat for  their invaluable contributions to the progress made in  negotiations. Several speakers, including the G-77/CHINA, the EU  and CG-11, supported entry into force of the Protocol in time for  the WSSD.

IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, supported completion of work forwarded  from COP-6 Part II, adding that this is not the right forum to  raise the question of new or additional commitments by developing  countries. BURKINA FASO, for the AFRICA GROUP, underscored the  high expectations of the international community that COP-7 will  be a success. SWITZERLAND, on behalf of the ENVIRONMENTAL  INTEGRITY GROUP, said the current stage of negotiations should be  concluded at COP-7, and stressed the need for entry into force of  the Protocol. GHANA highlighted Africa's needs, noting that the  continent was both the lowest emitter of greenhouse gases and the  most vulnerable to climate change.

MALI, speaking for the LDCs, hoped that developing countries, and  especially LDCs, would benefit from meaningful assistance.  AUSTRALIA and JAPAN welcomed President Elyazghi's intention to  consult and report back to the COP before the ministerial segment  on the agenda item 'second review of the adequacy of Article 4.2  (a) and (b),' and said they looked forward to a full discussion of  this issue at COP-8. The EU said the review of commitments should  not be debated at COP-7 or the WSSD, but only after the Protocol  has entered into force, possibly at COP-8.

# SBSTA

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

SBSTA Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) opened  the first meeting of SBSTA's fifteenth session. Regarding the  agenda, the EU requested consideration of decision 17/CP.5  containing operational parts on the consideration by Parties and  SBSTA on limiting emissions of hydrofluorocarbons and  perfluorocarbons.  He further underscored an EU proposal on terms  of reference to develop definitions and modalities for including  afforestation and deforestation projects under the CDM in the  first commitment period for consideration at SBSTA-15.  MALAYSIA,  supported by SAUDI ARABIA, noted that this was premature since the  rules and modalities of the CDM were being discussed separately  and had not been completed. Chair Dovland said the EU proposal  would be distributed.

### MATTERS REFERRED TO SBSTA BY THE COP

IPCC Third Assessment  Report: IPCC Chair Bob Watson introduced the Synthesis Report of  the Third Assessment Report (TAR), noting nine policy-relevant  questions and responses regarding: contribution of scientific,  technical and socioeconomic analyses to the definition of  'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system';  changes in the Earth's climate since the pre-industrial era;  regional and global climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic  consequences associated with greenhouse gas emissions arising from  TAR scenarios; climate fluctuations, extreme events and the risk  of abrupt/non-linear changes; inertia and time-scales associated  with changes in climate, ecological systems, and socioeconomic  sectors; implications of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations  at different levels; the potential for, costs and benefits of, and  timeframe for, mitigation; and interactions between climate change  and other environment and development issues.

Chair Dovland then invited participants to consider the  implications of the TAR for the future work of the SBSTA and any  requests to the IPCC. The EU, supported by JAPAN, CANADA,  MALAYSIA, AOSIS, NORWAY, SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA, but opposed by  SAUDI ARABIA, suggested holding a workshop on the implications of  the TAR for the work of the SBSTA. With MAURITIUS, UGANDA and  HUNGARY, he suggested consideration of outreach and wider  communication of the TAR. SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA stressed  the inclusion of developing country scientists, and literature in  languages other than English.

MALAYSIA emphasized the vulnerability of developing countries and  those in poverty and, with the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, supported  consideration of adaptation measures. Noting that recent events  underscore the role of multilateralism, AOSIS stressed the need  for a global solution to climate change with Protocol ratification  as a first step.

Chair Dovland noted emerging elements of agreement on how to  proceed, including on organizing a workshop prior to SBSTA-16. He  invited Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland) to conduct informal  consultations on a draft decision on the TAR. SAUDI ARABIA  stressed that there was no consensus on arranging a workshop that  would lead to a decision at COP-8.

# SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

SBI Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda)  opened the session, and the SBI then adopted its agenda. On  election of officers other than the Chair, Chair Ashe said  consultations were ongoing.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Chair Ashe said he would  prepare draft conclusions on interim financial performance for  2000-2001 and hold informal consultations on possible options to  respond to late payment of contributions. On implementation of the  Headquarters Agreement, GERMANY reported progress on the building  of a UN campus, the development of a congress center and matters  relating to Secretariat staff and their families. Chair Ashe said  he would prepare draft conclusions.

### MATTERS REFERRED TO SBI BY THE COP

On input to the WSSD, Chair  Ashe said this would be taken up by the COP on Friday, 2 November  following informal consultations, rather than in the SBI. On the  report of the GEF to the COP, further consideration of this matter  was deferred to the next SBI meeting.

Regarding proposals to amend the lists in UNFCCC Annexes I and II,  a brief discussion took place on a Turkish proposal submitted at  COP-6 Part I. Chair Ashe announced that informal consultations  would be held on this matter, and on Kazakhstan's proposal to add  its name to Annex I.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

On the date and venue  of COP-8, Secretary of the COP Richard Kinley informed delegates  that COP-5 had set 28 October to 8 November 2002 as the date for  COP-8. If no offer is received during COP-7, then COP-8 will be  held in Bonn. ARGENTINA noted the closeness of COP-8 to the WSSD  and suggested postponing COP-8 to early 2003. SAUDI ARABIA and  KUWAIT noted that the scheduled end of COP-8 would coincide with  the beginning of Ramadan, and suggested bringing it forward by one  week.

Regarding the calendar of meetings of Convention bodies for 2005- 2007, Richard Kinley noted increasing pressures on the  international calendar and highlighted the importance of advanced  planning to minimize costly cancellations. ARGENTINA said the  calendar should be considered within the wider context of  environmental governance. Chair Ashe said informal consultations  would be held both on this matter and on COP-8's date and venue.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

On national communications from non- Annex I Parties, the SBI considered the third compilation and  synthesis of initial communications. The US proposed that  recommendations from the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE) be  considered as a basis for improvements of the UNFCCC reporting  guidelines. On the report of the CGE, CANADA, with AUSTRALIA,  noted that there might be overlap between the report and the COP-6  Part II funding package, suggesting they be harmonized. The EU,  with AUSTRALIA, and opposed by MALAYSIA, CHINA and ARGENTINA, said  the report provided a sound basis to initiate the revised UNFCCC  guidelines. ARGENTINA, PANAMA and BURKINA FASO underlined the need  to integrate the preparation of national communications in the  development process of host countries. Chair Ashe said this issue  would be further considered in an informal group, along with the  provision of financial and technical support.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As the opening day of COP-7 drew to a close, many participants  seemed optimistic about the prospects for a successful outcome.  While some suggested that the 'negotiating fatigue' felt by many  veteran delegates in The Hague and Bonn was in evidence on a  fairly uneventful first day, several delegates observed a 'quiet  determination' to finish three years of negotiations in Marrakesh  in order to make the Kyoto Protocol ratifiable. A number of  observers also speculated that the more 'low key' atmosphere at  this meeting compared to the last COP might provide an appropriate  mood to complete the work.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### SBI

SBI will convene at 10:00 am in Plenary I to consider matters  related to LDCs, Annex I national communications, and other  matters.

### SBSTA

SBSTA will meet at 10:00 am and 3:00 pm in Plenary II to  discuss methodological issues, development and transfer of  technologies, and other matters.
