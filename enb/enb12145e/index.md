# PLENARY

Delegates met in Plenary to hear brief progress reports  from the Chairs of the informal groups. SBI Chair Ashe  thanked delegates and the Chairs of the groups for their  positive work. The G-77/CHINA expressed the hope that  further areas of convergence would continue to emerge  during SB-13, and stressed the need for a balanced package  of decisions at COP-6. The US said he was 'somewhat  concerned' at the slow pace of progress in some groups, and  called for concentrated efforts to keep the process on  track.

# INFORMAL MEETINGS

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Participants considered the section of the  Co-Chairs' text on the impact of implementation of response  measures. On technological development and economic  diversification, the US suggested including specific  reference to support for least developed countries. On the  issue of future workshops, delegates stressed the need for  these to be clearly focused. SAMOA, supported by the EU,  BELIZE, and JAMAICA, questioned the utility of  vulnerability indices, while EGYPT supported them.

On the section on Protocol Article 3.14, the US, with the  EU and several other developed countries, noted that it  dealt primarily with the impact of response measures, and  suggested merging it with the previous section that  directly addressed this issue. The G-77/CHINA, SAUDI  ARABIA, and a number of other developing countries repeated  their proposal for two separate draft decisions, one on  FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9, and one on Protocol Article 3.14.  BELIZE, speaking for AOSIS, said these paragraphs did not  address its concerns. AUSTRALIA, POLAND, the US, EU and  other Annex I Parties expressed reservations on a paragraph  inviting Annex I Parties to provide information on, inter  alia, existing market imperfections and subsidies in the  energy sector. SAUDI ARABIA said the paragraph should be  retained.

### MECHANISMS

Parties commenced discussion on the  consolidated text. The G-77/CHINA supported separate  decisions with individual chapeaus on the three mechanisms,  while CANADA, the EU and other Annex I countries supported  three decisions under one chapeau. The G-77/CHINA, opposed  by CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, the EU and US, advocated extending  the rigors of the CDM to JI. The G-77/CHINA stressed the  need to address the nature and scope of the mechanisms.  CANADA, while accepting the centrality of FCCC Article 3  (Principles), cautioned against going too far into the  nature and scope. The EU cautioned against defining new  principles. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, urged that  the adaptation fund draw from all three mechanisms.

Parties then reviewed the draft decision on guidelines for  implementation of Protocol Article 6 (JI). SAMOA, for  AOSIS, opposed by NORWAY, POLAND and CANADA, proposed  removing reference to these being 'guidelines.' The US,  opposed by AOSIS, proposed that revision to the guidelines  be taken by consensus. Parties were unable to agree on  whether to retain text relating to equity,  comprehensiveness, transparency, climate change  effectiveness, fungibility, and sharing of proceeds.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates continued discussing  guidelines under Article 7.1 (inclusion of supplementary  information in annual inventories). The US, opposed by the  EU and AUSTRALIA, proposed deleting the section on  adjustments in accordance with Article 5.2 (adjustments),  maintaining that reporting should be the responsibility of  the review team, not the Party. SAMOA noted the work on the  concept of a true-up period in the compliance group, and  said the group on Articles 5,7,and 8 should consider  technical constraints on its length.

On consideration of Article 7.2 (inclusion of supplementary  information in national communications), the US, NORWAY,  SAUDI ARABIA and GERMANY questioned the timing for the  submission of national communications and where this should  be treated. On national registries, the US identified the  importance of the discussions on the mechanisms for the  work in this group.

SAUDI ARABIA suggested that the national communications of  Annex I Parties include an evaluation of the extent to  which individual CDM projects have assisted non-Annex I  Parties to achieve sustainable development. NORWAY,  supported by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and the US, said this  was not realistic.

### COMPLIANCE

Delegates continued deliberation on the Co- Chairs' proposals. On submission of questions to the  compliance body, the G-77/CHINA said questions of  compliance could be raised by a Party with respect to  itself or another Party. The US said a Party should be able  to refer questions with respect to another Party's  compliance only to the facilitation branch. AUSTRALIA  suggested that apart from the questions raised in the  expert review teams' (ERT) reports, questions could be  raised by a Party only with regard to itself. The G-77/CHINA emphasized the role of the ERTs and suggested that  the relationship between the COP and ERTs be taken into  account. The EU, opposed by CHINA, supported a role for the  FCCC Secretariat. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by the US,  highlighted the need to reflect Protocol Article 8(3) (ERTs  to report to the COP/MOP) in the provision.

On the preliminary examination of questions, the G-77/CHINA  said the functions it envisaged at this stage were to  ensure that the question is supported by sufficient  information and is not de minimis, and to direct the case  to a particular branch. She said this task should be  undertaken by a plenary of the compliance committee. The UK  said the screening process should simply be an  organizational stage to ensure that the relevant branch  receives the case. He suggested creating a bureau of the  compliance committee consisting of two members,  representing the enforcement and facilitative branches, to  perform this function. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested  that all questions should go automatically to the  facilitation branch. The US said there should be two  functions, one related to allocation and the other to  substance. The allocation function would be performed by a  bureau of the compliance institution, and the substantive  screening, which would be necessary only for cases referred  to the enforcement branch, would be undertaken by the  enforcement branch.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Participants began consideration of the  revised Chair's text on capacity building in developing  countries. In response to the G-77/CHINA's query on timing  for consideration of a draft decision on capacity building,  Chair Ashe drew attention to decision 10/CP.5, which calls  for Parties to synthesize elements of a draft framework for  capacity building at SB-12 for consideration at SB-13. He  noted that a contact group would be set up during SB-13 to  start deliberations on a draft decision. The EU, the US and  CANADA stressed the need to ensure consistency with the  capacity building aspects of other discussions on  technology transfer and adaptation.

On purposes, the EU asked what review process would be  established. The G-77/China inquired what the basis for  such a review would be and if this would constitute an  additional reporting requirement. AUSTRALIA said capacity  building should be designed to facilitate monitoring and  implementation.

On demonstration projects, the G-77/CHINA said these were  not critical in identifying needs and stressed that  sufficient information had already been submitted. The EU  said that while demonstration projects could be useful,  lessons should be drawn from existing activities. He  underscored the importance of a results-based approach.  AUSTRALIA highlighted the need for an appropriate enabling  environment for capacity building.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Participants considered the sections  on technology information and enabling environments in the  draft text on a framework to facilitate development and  transfer of technology. They heard presentations by the  FCCC Secretariat on a possible framework for a technology  transfer system, and by the Climate Technology Initiative  on its website.

The G-77/CHINA underscored Parties' obligation to submit  information on how they are implementing their commitments.  Regarding gathering information on technology needs and  availability, she raised the question of how Parties  facilitate access to technologies and what the conditions  of access are. KENYA suggested that countries that have  submitted national communications be facilitated to conduct  their technology needs assessments noting that the second  national communication may not take place until 2006. With  the G-77/CHINA, she noted with concern that GEF is  allocating funds to technology needs assessments instead of  national communications.

NEW ZEALAND supported the concept, in principle, of a  clearinghouse and emphasized the use of existing  institutions. The US highlighted limitations with one-stop  shops and supported the establishment of an international,  rather than regional and sub-regional, clearinghouse.  CHINA, PERU, and MALAYSIA urged moving ahead by focusing on  practical measures.

### LULUCF

Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho, Brazilian Space Agency,  outlined the implications of different approaches to  including LULUCF on the ability of Parties to mitigate  climate change as required under the Protocol. He noted the  current temporary uptake of carbon in the biosphere due to  natural effects, and said that under a full carbon  accounting approach, Annex I countries would be allowed to  emit more than under a business-as-usual scenario.  Delegates then continued discussing the compilation text of  country-specific data and information as submitted by  Parties. The EU noted the gaps in existing data, stressing  that data was a crucial input to the negotiating process.  AUSTRALIA noted that Annex I countries had the capacity to  make adequate carbon measurements, and that the quality was  continually improving. Co-Chair Thorgeirsson then  summarized the work carried out thus far, and identified  key unresolved issues, including: separating human-induced  effects from natural uptake of carbon; the package of  eligible additional activities under Article 3.4; and  limitations of credits and debits.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Co-Chair Richard Muyungi (Tanzania)  introduced draft conclusions and elements for a draft  decision on 'best practices' in policies and measures  (P&Ms). The G-77/CHINA asked the Co-Chair to postpone  discussion on the draft text pending internal G-77/CHINA  consideration. Parties made general comments related to,  inter alia: continuing work into the future; avoiding  reference to issues under discussion in other groups; and  ensuring that the outcome is focused on helping to  implement the provisions of Protocol Article 2 (P&Ms).

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates have been commenting on the irony of the timing  of the crippling French transport strike. Attendance at  some of the sessions was affected on Thursday, and there  was speculation on the possible impact of the strike on the  arrival of key delegates, and on the already slow pace of  the deliberations. Several observers suggested that the  strike begs the question: is the public really prepared to  pay for climate policies?
