# SBSTA

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke  Waller-Hunter welcomed delegates and conveyed SBSTA Chair  Abdullatif Benrageb's regrets that he was unable to attend. She  thanked Amjad Abdulla (Maldives) for chairing the meeting. She  observed that SBSTA has a heavy agenda that will contribute to  the eleventh Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and first  Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP-11/MOP-1).

Luxembourg, for the EU, urged delegates to build on the positive  experience of the Seminar of Governmental Experts, and supported  setting in motion deliberations on the post-2012 period. On the  SBSTA agenda, he emphasized the item on mitigation, and welcomed  discussions on adaptation, aviation and maritime transport.

Jamaica, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed international action on  climate change and its linkages with the Millennium Development  Goals (MDGs). She also highlighted issues of adaptation,  mitigation and methodological issues. Kenya, for the AFRICA GROUP,  pressed for simplified CDM modalities and urgent action on  technology transfer and adaptation. Tuvalu, on behalf of the  ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), highlighted adaptation  and the needs of small island developing States (SIDS). EGYPT  called for increased efforts on mitigation. MALI highlighted the  impacts of climate change on least developed countries (LDCs).

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Chair Amjad Abdulla introduced the agenda  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/1). SAUDI ARABIA, supported by QATAR, stated that  COP decision 10/CP.9 on adaptation should also be reflected in the  agenda of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), and  suggested deferring adoption of the SBSTA agenda until the matter  was resolved. The EU, G-77/CHINA, AFRICA GROUP, NORWAY, JAPAN,  SOUTH AFRICA, NEW ZEALAND, KENYA, TANZANIA and others supported  adopting the SBSTA agenda. Chair Abdulla took note of Saudi  Arabia's concerns, and the agenda was adopted. Delegates also  accepted Chair Abdulla's updated proposal for the session's  organization of work.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Emissions from Fuel Used for International  Aviation and Maritime Transport: The UNFCCC Secretariat introduced  its updated note on this matter (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.2). The  International Civil Aviation Organization then summarized its work  in this area. Several Parties underscored the importance of this  issue. SAUDI ARABIA questioned whether the UNFCCC report is  consistent with the request of SB-21, because it references  non-Annex I Parties even though they are not required to report on  bunker fuels. José Romero (Switzerland) will chair a contact group  on this agenda item.

Implications of CDM Project Activities for the Achievement of  Objectives of Other Environmental Conventions and Protocols: The  Secretariat recalled COP-10 decision 12/CP.10 requesting SBSTA and  the CDM Executive Board to develop a recommendation for COP/MOP-1  on implications for other environmental instruments, particularly  the Montreal Protocol, arising from the establishment of new  hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22 facilities to earn certified emissions  reductions (CERs) for the destruction of hydrofluorocarbon-23.

The EU, supported by ARGENTINA, AOSIS and the US, suggested that  the Secretariat invite contributions from the Parties and prepare  a paper for SB-23. AOSIS proposed a limit on credits. ARGENTINA  noted that some facilities were being moved from developed to  developing countries. Chair Abdulla invited Georg Børsting  (Norway) to convene a contact group.

Completion of the Technical Guidance on Methodologies for  Adjustments under Protocol Article 5.2 (Methodologies for LULUCF):  The EU, with AOSIS, welcomed the Secretariat's document  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/2) as a sound basis to begin discussions and  looked forward to completing the work at this session. JAPAN  stressed consistency with previous decisions and the need for  simplified guidance, taking into account the specific nature of  land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Noting the  possibility of disagreements between review teams and Parties,  AUSTRALIA welcomed SBSTA's discussion on adjustments following  completion of the trial period. Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton  Paciornik (Brazil) were requested to co-chair a contact group.

###     Registry Systems

Murray Ward (New Zealand) presented results from  informal negotiations held prior to SBSTA-22  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/Inf.3), and announced that the international  transaction log (ITL) will not be operative before the second half  of 2006. He noted that CDM projects cannot participate in the EU  carbon market until the ITL is operational, underscoring the  Secretariat's funding needs to complete ITL. Chair Abdulla said  informal consultations would be held.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

Special  Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on  Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and Global Climate System - Issues  Relating to HFCs and PFCs: Susan Solomon and Bert Metz, IPCC,  presented the main findings of the new report. Solomon reported  that there had been a significant increase in HFC and HCFC  concentrations. Metz noted the potential for reducing emissions  through, inter alia, recovery, recycling, and containment, and  emphasized that although HCFCs and CFC banks are a significant  contributor to emissions, there are no regulatory restrictions  under either the Montreal or the Kyoto Protocols. Rajendra  Pachauri, IPCC Chair, updated delegates on IPCC's work, including  progress on the Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and  Storage, Guidelines for National GHG Inventories, and the IPCC  Fourth Assessment Report. URUGUAY, with KENYA and JAPAN, called  for coordinated work between the Montreal Protocol and the UNFCCC,  taking into account national circumstances. AUSTRALIA said further  consideration by SBSTA was unnecessary and encouraged domestic  action.

GREENPEACE highlighted the existence of larger banks than  previously thought, which would continue to rise beyond 2015, and  urged progressive phase out. Noting that future technology will  advance rapidly, the ALLIANCE FOR RESPONSIBLE ATMOSPHERIC POLICY  stressed the need for cost-effective reductions. A contact group  will be formed.

International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the  Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of SIDS: AOSIS  noted that the UN General Assembly will consider the Mauritius  Strategy during its next session, and proposed that SBSTA consider  the Strategy at SBSTA-23. Chair Abdulla said he would prepare  draft conclusions.

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Chair Abdulla reminded  Parties that SBSTA-22 must provide clear guidance and terms of  reference for the future work of the Expert Group on Technology  Transfer (EGTT). EGTT Chair Kumar Singh (Trinidad and Tobago)  reported on the EGTT's seventh meeting and on future EGTT work.  Malaysia, for the G-77/CHINA, said SBSTA should now consider how  to meet the needs identified in countries' technology needs  assessments. He called for a full review of all COP decisions  relating to technology transfer since COP-1.

The EU noted its pledge of voluntary financial resources to  support the EGTT 2005 programme of work, and proposed that Parties  request that the EGTT suggests a way forward on public and/or  private partnerships, cooperation with relevant conventions, and  medium- and long-term planning for the EGTT. Australia, for the  UMBRELLA GROUP, noted the emphasis at the recent Seminar of  Governmental Experts on mobilizing private sector resources and  support for an enabling environment. GHANA underlined the  importance of prioritizing countries' technology assessments.  CHINA said the development and transfer of technologies for  adaptation and mitigation can yield commercial benefits, but noted  man-made barriers to the effective operation of the market. CANADA  underlined the benefits of early action on technology transfer,  enabling environments and appropriate capacity building. JAPAN  noted that the private sector holds most climate-related  technologies and stressed the importance of public-private  partnerships. A contact group was formed to continue these  discussions.

### RESEARCH NEEDS RELATING TO THE CONVENTION

Introducing its  synthesis of views on issues from the research event at SB-20  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/3), the Secretariat cited its efforts to look  across various agenda items to find relationships among them. The  EU, opposed by KENYA, proposed a brief study to identify key  policy relevant research issues to be communicated to the research  community. SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA underscored that duplication  of IPCC efforts should be avoided. There was agreement on the need  to enhance the capacity of developing countries to contribute to  global climate change efforts. SENEGAL and GHANA noted their  desire to be more actively involved in a range of research areas.  María Paz Cigaran Tolmos (Peru) and Sergio Castellari (Italy)  will chair a contact group on this issue.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Chair Abdulla drew attention to a document  prepared by the Secretariat on options for using web-based  approaches to share experiences and exchange information on good  practices in policies and measures (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/Inf.10).

SAUDI ARABIA said he would provide input during the roundtable  discussion scheduled for Tuesday morning, 24 May 2005. The EU  expressed disappointment that more progress was not made at  SBSTA-21, and favored a 'prompt start to a smart, low-cost  website.' AOSIS noted that exchanges of ideas will help  post-2012 discussions. Tony Surridge (South Africa) and Normand  Tremblay (Canada) will chair a contact group.

### OTHER MATTERS

Issues Relating to the Implementation of Kyoto  Protocol Article 2.3 (Adverse Effects of Policies and Measures):  Chair Abdulla introduced this issue, noting that little progress  had been made in previous discussions. The EU and JAPAN emphasized  that these issues are covered by other agenda items, and the EU  added that the Article should be considered after COP/MOP-1. Chair  Abdulla said he would convene informal consultations.

###     Global Climate Observing System

Chair Abdulla said he would draft  conclusions on the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) for  SBSTA's consideration.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ADJUSTMENTS FOR LULUCF

On Thursday evening, the Contact Group on  technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under the  Protocol convened. The Secretariat presented the proposed  technical guidance for adjustment of LULUCF estimates, noting that  it was built into existing technical guidance. The EU expressed  its preference for annual calculations of adjustments and, with  AUSTRALIA, RUSSIA, and NEW ZEALAND, called for a trial review  period. Discussions will continue in formal and informal meetings  co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton Paciornik  (Brazil).

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and  Holger Liptow (Germany) convened a Contact Group to advance  discussion on terms of reference to guide EGTT recommendations on  enhancing its framework for implementation of a technology  transfer framework pursuant to COP decision 6/CP.10. Participants  exchanged views on the scope of SBSTA's mandate, which MALAYSIA  described as flawed. The US cautioned against producing a  universal wish list. CHINA called for a consensus on what  constitutes meaningful activity. Co-Chair Liptow invited  participants to consider some key words to orient informal  discussions on Friday, 20 May.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As SB-22 got underway Thursday morning, there were few signs of  the enthusiasm or openness evident at the Seminar of Governmental  Experts earlier in the week. Apparently, few delegates expected  such enthusiasm. 'Business-as-usual' is how one delegate described  the day's session, which began with lengthy disagreements over the  adoption of the SBSTA agenda due to initial objections from Saudi  Arabia. 'Standard delaying tactics,' is how another delegate  described the dispute, although some delegates seemed gratified by  the G-77/China's stated position in support of the agenda. For its  part, the Saudi delegation was adamant its concerns were genuine.

Meanwhile, one expert pointed out that delegations are smaller at  SB-22 than at previous SBs, and speculated on whether Parties are  'keeping their powder dry' for COP/MOP-1.
