# SBI PLENARY

Chair Stoycheva reported on a meeting of the SBSTA and SBI Chairs  and the Chairs of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer,  Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national  communications, and LDC Expert Group (LEG) in response to decision  10/CP.8 (development and transfer of technologies) to facilitate  collaboration among the expert groups established under the  UNFCCC. She then invited Parties to consider draft conclusions on  a number of agenda items.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Contact group Chair Markus Nauser reported on  the deliberations in the group. Parties adopted the conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.6) without amendment. In the conclusions, SBI  encourages Parties to cooperate in the key areas identified at the  African regional workshop in January 2004. SBI requests the  Secretariat to prepare an intermediate review report on progress  in implementing Article 6, based on information contained in  national communications and other information received by the  Secretariat, by 15 August 2004. The report of the submissions will  form the basis for a draft COP-10 decision. Regarding the small- scale model of the Article 6 information network clearing house,  SBI requests the Secretariat to report to SBI-21 on progress of  work, including: detailed technical specifications for the  development and implementation of the clearing house; a profile  for an institutional home for the clearing house; a tentative time  frame for implementation; and options, and their estimated  financial implications, for the development and implementation of  the clearing house.

SBI also notes that regional workshops are essential to advance  the implementation of Article 6 activities, and invites Parties  and others in a position to do so, to contribute to financing the  remaining workshops, which address the needs of Asia, Latin  America and the members of AOSIS. The annex to the conclusions  contains consolidated views of Parties and guidance to the  Secretariat on the further development of the Article 6  information network clearing house. It outlines the  characteristics and elements of the first phase of work, including  to: target Parties, but be accessible to the general public; focus  on the education and public awareness components of Article 6;  facilitate contributions from, and dissemination of relevant  information to, the target audience; explore and use nodes to  provide and exchange information from regional, sub-regional and  national entities; and assess the effectiveness of the clearing  house on an on-going basis.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Contact group Chair Dechen Tsering reported on  the outcomes of the negotiations. Parties then adopted the  conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.5) without amendment. In the  conclusions, SBI decides to complete the elaboration of a draft  decision on the range and effectiveness of capacity-building  activities in developing countries at SBI-21. SBI also requests  the Secretariat, subject to the availability of resources, to  convene a meeting of practitioners to contribute to the  comprehensive review at COP-10, and present the outcomes of the  meeting to SBI-21.

SBI invites Parties, particularly EITs, to submit additional  information by 15 August 2004 on the effectiveness of  capacity-building activities in EITs, and requests the Secretariat  to solicit similar information from the GEF and other  intergovernmental organizations. The Secretariat is requested to  prepare an analytical paper on the effectiveness of implementing  the framework on capacity building in EITs, based on these  submissions and other available information, for consideration  at SBI-21.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

LDCs: Chair  Stoycheva said she had conducted informal consultations on matters  relating to LDCs. Parties adopted the conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.4) without amendment, endorsing the proposed work  programme for the second term (2004-2005) of the LEG. In the  conclusions, SBI invites the Chair of the LEG to update SBI-21 on  progress made in implementing the work programme of the LEG.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Contact group Chair  Karsten Sach reported on negotiations, and said the draft  conclusions cover all agenda sub-items, including arrangements for  COP-10, future sessional periods, organization of the  intergovernmental process, effective participation in the UNFCCC  process, and arrangements for COP/MOP-1. The INDIGENOUS PEOPLES'  ORGANIZATIONS (IPOs) expressed gratitude to SBI for having  considered the effective participation of IPOs, and hoped greater  attention would be given to climate change and indigenous peoples.  Parties adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.7) without  amendment. As COP-10 host country, ARGENTINA expressed an aim to  create a participatory atmosphere at COP-10, in order to ensure  progress toward the implementation of the Protocol.

In the conclusions on COP-10, SBI recognizes that 2004 is the  tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the UNFCCC, and that  this will serve as the central theme for COP-10. It endorses the  dates of 15-17 December 2004 for the high-level segment. SBI also  recommends panel discussions as the mode of exchange during the  high-level segment, on four themes: The UNFCCC after 10 years:  accomplishments and future challenges; Impacts of climate change,  adaptation measures and sustainable development; Technology and  climate change; and Mitigation of climate change: policies and  their impacts. On organization of the intergovernmental process,  SBI requests the Secretariat to convene a workshop in conjunction  with SBI-21, and prepare a background paper taking into account  relevant experience in other multilateral processes.

On effective participation in the UNFCCC process, SBI takes note  of a concern expressed with respect to the interpretation of the  Rules of Procedure of the CDM EB on transparency and attendance.  It agrees to continue its consideration of effective participation  at SBI-22, on the basis of submissions received by 31 January  2005. Regarding participation of observer organizations, SBI takes  note of the Secretariat's current approach to the admission of  observer organizations, and agrees to continue consideration on  the matter. SBI agrees that requests for submission of information  and views could be extended to NGOs on the understanding that such  submissions would not be issued as official documents, but would  be made available on the Secretariat Internet site. Regarding  participation of indigenous peoples, SBI considers the  recommendations of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and  requests by IPOs. SBI encourages IPOs to make use of the existing  bodies and opportunities currently afforded to them under the  UNFCCC, and acknowledges the importance of enhanced participation  by IPOs in the UNFCCC process.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Budget performance for the  biennium 2004-5: Parties adopted the conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.2) without amendment. In the conclusions, SBI  takes note of the information of the work programme for 2004-5  relating to UNFCCC Article 4.8 (adverse effects). SBI also takes  note of the status of contributions as of 31 May 2004. SBI  expresses appreciation to the Parties that have made their  contributions to the core budget in time and in full, and  particularly to those Parties that have made contributions to the  Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC Process and the Trust  Fund for Supplementary Activities, and urges Parties that have not  yet made their contributions to the core budget to do so as soon  as possible. SBI stresses the importance of maintaining a high  level of contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation in the  UNFCCC Process to ensure effective participation at UNFCCC  sessions by developing countries, especially LDCs and SIDS.

###     Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement

Parties adopted the  conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.3) without amendment. In the  conclusions, SBI takes note of the statement by the Host  Government regarding the UN Campus and international conference  center in Bonn.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### LULUCF GPG

In the morning, Co-Chair Audun Rosland outlined  progress in informal consultations, and suggested suspending the  contact group to continue work in a drafting group on common  reporting format (CRF) tables, facilitated by Maria Sanz. The  contact group resumed discussions in the afternoon. Maria Sanz  reported completion of work on the CRF, except for the  identification of LULUCF activities in relation to Protocol  Article 6 (joint implementation), and said that Parties had agreed  to forward the matter to SBSTA-21.

Delegates then discussed SBSTA draft conclusions on other LULUCF  issues. BRAZIL, on behalf of the G-77/China, and opposed by  CANADA, the EU, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and AUSTRALIA, proposed  insertion of additional text on factoring out containing specific  reference to the draft COP/MOP decision on LULUCF, decision  11/CP.7 (LULUCF), and other related LULUCF issues. Following  informal discussions, Co-Chair William Agyemang-Bonsu proposed  text referring to the section on GPG in the SBSTA-19 report  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/15) instead. Parties agreed. Delegates continued  discussions on draft conclusions on GPG. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  requested reconsidering a paragraph on factoring out in the draft  conclusion on other LULUCF issues. Co-Chair Agyemang-Bonsu noted  that the paragraph had been agreed, and can only be re-opened  in Plenary.

On CRF, AOSIS proposed including language noting that SBSTA had  finalized the CRF tables, subject to consideration of matters  relating to Protocol Article 6. The EU, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, CANADA  and JAPAN opposed this insertion, noting that work on the CRF had  been finalized. Co-Chair Agyemang-Bonsu suggested CRF tables had  been 'elaborated' instead of 'finalized.' CANADA, supported by the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION, EU and JAPAN, proposed new paragraphs noting  that SBSTA had not concluded the question relating to Protocol  Article 6 and would further consider the issue at SBSTA-21. After  several rounds of informal consultations, Parties approved the  text, and agreed to the draft conclusions.

### ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION

On adaptation, Parties considered  revised draft conclusions, agreeing on text and completing their  deliberations. On text welcoming the exchange of views on the  SBSTA-20 in-sessional workshop on adaptation, the US and SAUDI  ARABIA, opposed by JAPAN, proposed deleting reference to business.  The EU objected to considering the conclusions on adaptation as  adopted until agreement was reached on the conclusions on  mitigation. SAUDI ARABIA and BRAZIL expressed disappointment at  the EU's intervention, stressing that the conclusions are not  linked. Delegates agreed on the draft conclusions.

On mitigation, Parties agreed on the revised draft conclusions,  following minor changes.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

Parties convened briefly in the  afternoon, and agreed to continue deliberations on annexed draft  text at SBI-21. At the request of KENYA, for the G-77/China,  Parties agreed to remove an invitation to non-Annex I Parties to  submit views on gaps and challenges relating to support from the  GEF and other bilateral and multilateral organizations, the  Special Climate Change Fund, LDC Fund and other bilateral and  multilateral organizations, and insurance-related actions of  decision 5/CP.7.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Parties expressed relief at the conclusion of the marathon  discussions on good practice guidance for LULUCF. Some suggested  that the outcomes may help facilitate Russian ratification of the  Kyoto Protocol.

During a pseudo contact group attended by numerous delegates and  observers, UNFCCC Secretariat staff member Claudio Forner proposed  marriage to ENB writer Dagmar Lohan. Many tears of joy were shed  as delegates expressed the view that this was possibly the most  productive session of SB-20.
