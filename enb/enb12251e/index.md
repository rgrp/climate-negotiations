# SBI

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Submission of second and,  where appropriate, third national communications: BRAZIL, for the  G-77/China, said that non-Annex I Parties require additional time  and support for preparing their national communications, and  preferred not having a specific schedule for the submission of  national communications. AUSTRALIA, for the Umbrella Group, called  for agreement at COP-10 on a schedule for submissions. The EU  urged a decision that will safeguard the continuity of the  submission process and encourage submission cycles. A contact  group co-chaired by Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu (Mauritius) and  Anders Turesson (Sweden) will address the matter.

###     Work of the Consultative Group of Experts

Brian Challenger  (Antigua and Barbuda), Chair of the Consultative Group of Experts  on non-Annex I national communications (CGE), reported on progress  in implementing the CGE's 2004-5 work programme. The REPUBLIC OF  KOREA offered to host a global workshop. MOZAMBIQUE requested that  a workshop be held in her country. AOSIS urged assistance to SIDS.  SWITZERLAND stressed the need for greater capacity within, and  support to, the CGE. Chair Stoycheva will prepare draft conclusions.

###     Provision of financial and technical support

Chair Stoycheva will  prepare draft conclusions on the issue.

###     Compilation and synthesis of initial national communications

Chair Stoycheva will prepare draft conclusions on the issue.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF): The EU  said a recent meeting of potential SCCF donors had resulted in  pledges of US$35 million. SAUDI ARABIA said no single activity  should be prioritized over others. ARGENTINA, with PANAMA,  welcomed the pledges to the SCCF, but noted that these are  insufficient for effectively supporting adaptation and disaster  response. AOSIS, supported by the AFRICA GROUP, LDCs, NAMIBIA,  CUBA and UGANDA, expressed concern over the interpretation of COP  guidance by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), underlining  that the most vulnerable countries face difficulty in accessing  GEF funds due to the burden of co-financing requirements, the  existence of additional criteria and indicators not adopted by the  COP, and the narrow scope of adaptation projects eligible under  the GEF. SWITZERLAND noted that the new criteria seek to simplify  the incremental cost principle and the US welcomed the  differentiation in criteria applied to the General Trust Fund and  SCCF. SAMOA urged that more innovative approaches be used and that  the COP, not the GEF, should determine eligibility criteria.

###     Report of the GEF

The GEF described its activities on national  communications, capacity building, adaptation, LDCs and the SCCF.  ARGENTINA voiced concern over the GEF's administrative costs, and,  with MAURITIUS and UGANDA, called for transparency on the use of  donor funds. AOSIS underlined that the GEF must follow the  guidance given by the COP.

Responding to Parties' comments, the GEF explained that the  proportion of co-financing is due to the GEF requirement to fund  only incremental costs. Regarding administrative costs he said  this issue is addressed by the GEF Council.

Implementation of decision 5/CP.8 (review of the financial  mechanism): JAPAN welcomed the GEF's leverage of substantial  co-financing resources. The US noted that the GEF finances the  incremental costs of implementation, yet many projects presented  in national communications do not identify such costs. The EU  highlighted the importance of identifying funds for the fourth GEF  replenishment.

###     Additional guidance to the GEF

JAPAN said the COP should provide  guidance to the GEF on project eligibility and criteria, but not  on issues related to the GEF's management. MICRONESIA emphasized  SIDS' difficulties in accessing funds. NEW ZEALAND suggested that  the GEF should be more flexible and provide support for  small-scale projects in SIDS.

A contact group, co-chaired by Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and  Jozef Buys (Belgium), will address the SCCF, implementation of  decision 5/CP.8 and additional guidance to the GEF. Chair  Stoycheva will prepare draft conclusions on the report of the GEF.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Philip Gwage (Uganda) reported on the meeting  of capacity-building practitioners held on 3 December 2004 in  Buenos Aires. JAPAN supported reporting on capacity-building  activities through existing UNFCCC instruments, such as national  communications. TANZANIA, for the G-77/China, identified the need  for indicators and a reporting and monitoring procedure. The US  said all Parties should endeavor to improve their reporting on  capacity building. Roger Cornforth (New Zealand) and Shirley  Moroka (South Africa) will co-chair a contact group.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

UNEP reported on its contributions to assist  Parties in their implementation of Article 6. The EU and  SWITZERLAND highlighted the merit of an information clearing  house. The US said the clearing house should be user-friendly,  cost-effective and developed through a phased approach. Crispin  d'Auvergne (Saint Lucia) will chair a contact group on the issue.

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

AUSTRALIA suggested including net  greenhouse gas emissions by Annex I Parties in the compilation and  synthesis of national communications. CHINA, for G-77/ China,  suggested including data on impacts of mitigation policies.  URUGUAY proposed a scientific review and SWITZERLAND suggested  publishing a collection of best practices. Chair Stoycheva will  prepare a draft decision in consultation with interested Parties.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

The Secretariat highlighted  limitations in the operation of the Secretariat caused by the  depreciation of the US dollar. Chair Stoycheva designated Harald  Dovland (Norway) to conduct informal consultations on this issue.

### CONTINUING REVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS OF THE  SECRETARIAT

The Secretariat presented information on staff  geographical representation and workshop costs. INDIA, for  G-77/China, proposed to evaluate the balance between senior  staff coming from Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Opposed by the  EU, SAUDI ARABIA suggested keeping this item permanently on the  agenda. Harald Dovland will conduct informal consultations.

# SBSTA

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Greenhouse gas inventories: The IPCC  Inventories Task Force Bureau reported on progress in compiling  the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories. AUSTRALIA,  with the EU and US, called for further development of the UNFCCC  website. Branca Americano (Brazil) and Helen Plume (New Zealand)  will facilitate informal consultations on the issue.

###     Registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4

Murray Ward (New  Zealand) reported on intersessional consultations on registry  systems, held from 8-10 November 2004 in Bonn. The EU welcomed the  implementation of the registry system. Murray Ward will chair a  contact group on the issue.

###     Protocol Articles 7 and 8

The EU said the proposal for a standard  reporting format provides a good basis for discussion. The contact  group on registry systems will address this issue.

###     Annex I emissions projections

Chair Benrageb will prepare draft  conclusions on this issue.

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Margaret Martin (Canada),  Chair of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT), reported  on implementation of EGTT's 2004 work programme and described its  proposed 2005 work programme. Many Parties commended EGTT's  efforts to engage the private sector and welcomed the results of  the workshop on innovative options for financing the development  and transfer of technologies.

Several Parties stressed the importance of EGTT's work on enabling  environments and expressed support for a seminar on technologies  for adaptation scheduled for 2005. Delegates also addressed the  resource implications for maintaining the UNFCCC technology  clearing house (TT:CLEAR). A contact group, co-chaired by Kishan  Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Holger Liptow (Germany) will  address the issue.

### P&MS

SAUDI ARABIA, for G-77/China, requested more time to consider  the relevant document prepared by the Secretariat. CHINA expressed  reservations about the document's title. A contact group co-chaired  by Tony Surridge (South Africa) and Michael Young (Ireland) will  address the agenda item.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

Representatives from the IPCC, Convention on Biological Diversity  (CBD), Food and Agriculture Organization, and UN Forum on Forests  reported on their respective activities related to the UNFCCC  process. SWITZERLAND suggested strengthening the role of the Joint  Liaison Group of the CBD, UNFCCC and UN Convention to Combat  Desertification. The US said cooperation should be on national and  local levels. A contact group, co-chaired by Outi Berghäll (Finland)  and Marcela Main (Chile) will address the issue.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### LULUCF GPG

This contact group was co-chaired by Audun Rosland  (Norway) and William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana). Co-Chair Rosland  recalled progress achieved on the common reporting format at  SBSTA-20. Delegates heard presentations from Canada and Sweden on  reporting systems for the Protocol and engaged in a question-and- answer session. The Secretariat reported on issues related to  LULUCF under Protocol Article 6 (joint implementation). Co-Chair  Rosland, supported by the EU, CANADA and JAPAN, proposed removing  all brackets in the draft negotiating text forwarded from SBSTA-20  and deleting the option on the common reporting format referring  to Article 6. BRAZIL, for G-77/China, requested time to consider  the matter further, but hoped to reach agreement on the issue at  COP-10. AOSIS, opposed by CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, said SBSTA  should request the IPCC to revise 'method one' (units of land  subject to multiple activities) in the GPG.

### R&SO

This contact group was co-chaired by Stefan Rösner (Germany)  and Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu. Participants heard a presentation  by GCOS on its Implementation Plan in support of the UNFCCC.  Co-Chair Rösner requested inputs by Parties to the draft decision.  Participants noted the importance of discussing, inter alia, the  financial implications of the GCOS Implementation Plan, capacity  building, and identifying gaps in systematic observation.

### SMALL-SCALE A&R CDM

Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Jim Penman (UK)  co-chaired this contact group. Delegates discussed the proposal  for a draft decision on simplified modalities and procedures for  small-scale A&R CDM activities and measures to facilitate the  implementation of project activities, paragraph-by-paragraph. On  definitions of small-scale A&R CDM, JAPAN, with several Parties,  and opposed by AOSIS, supported reference to average projected net  anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks. AOSIS, opposed by  CHILE, JAPAN, and PERU, proposed deletion of text stating that  projects will be exempt from, or subject to, paying a lower share  of proceeds to the Protocol's Adaptation Fund. CANADA, with  several Parties, and opposed by the EU and AOSIS, supported  maintaining reference to reduced rates of the share of project  proceeds to cover administrative expenses, noting that costs are  the greatest barrier for low income communities. Participants  agreed to delete text encouraging host Parties to establish  measures to facilitate implementation of small-scale A&R. Text  inviting assistance for capacity-building activities for the  application and implementation of simplified modalities and  procedures was agreed.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

The contact group, co-chaired by Paul Watkinson  (France) and Samuel Adejuwon (Nigeria), reviewed the draft  decision from SBI-20, identifying the proponents of each paragraph  and outstanding issues. G-77/CHINA noted the need for further  discussions within the Group.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While the pending entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol  demonstrates that progress has indeed been made, Tuesday's  discussions showed the re-emergence of past tensions between the  COP and the GEF that many thought had subsided. Equally stuck in  molasses seemed the contact group on adverse effects, where  delegates remarked that, with few changes in position since SB-20,  significant informal consultations will be needed for a decision  to be reached at COP-10.
