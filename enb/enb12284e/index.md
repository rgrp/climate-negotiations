# CONTACT GROUPS

### ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS

This contact group considered two matters  - the institutional linkage of the Convention secretariat to the  UN, and privileges and immunities for individuals serving on  constituted bodies under the Kyoto Protocol. Regarding  institutional linkages, delegates discussed a draft COP decision  that Co-Chair Nakayama said was consistent with previous COP  decisions. No major disagreements arose, and delegates agreed to  return to the text at the next contact group meeting. On  privileges and immunities, delegates agreed to take this item up  at the group's next meeting to give Parties more time to consider  the Secretariat's proposals (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/6). A representative  from the CDM Executive Board will be invited to explain Board  members' concerns.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates reviewed a draft COP decision  and offered initial comments on a draft COP/MOP decision. On the  COP decision, they agreed to a US proposal to note the need to  streamline the review procedures in light of the additional review  requirements for Annex I Parties that are also Parties to the  Kyoto Protocol. Delegates also agreed to text requesting the  Secretariat to organize a 'centralized' rather than 'expedited'  review of the fourth national communications. The group then  discussed an EU proposal, opposed by the US, to add reference to  the year 2007 when noting that annual inventory reviews for 2006  may be delayed in order to facilitate coordination with other  review processes. The Co-Chairs will produce a revised draft COP  decision for consideration at the next contact group meeting, at  which time delegates will also review the draft COP/MOP decision.

### CAPACITY BUILDING (KYOTO PROTOCOL)

Co-Chairs Goco and Turesson  explained that the contact group would work on two draft  decisions, one for developing countries and one for countries with  economies in transition. JAPAN said discussions should focus on  the framework, as mandated by Decision 3/CP.7. The G-77/CHINA  stressed capacity building for the CDM. JAPAN said this should be  considered in the CDM contact group. SOUTH AFRICA underscored that  capacity building is a cross-cutting issue.

### CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD REPORT

The first session of this contact  group focused on identifying and clarifying issues the group  should address. The group decided to consider general CDM  implementation issues, including the registration deadline for  prompt-start projects, environmental integrity, CDM's continuity  after 2012, cooperation with entities from non-Kyoto Parties, and  technology transfer. JAPAN said carbon dioxide capture and storage  technologies should not be excluded from the CDM, and BRAZIL  called for COP/MOP 1 guidance on this issue.

The group also discussed working on CDM governance, the Board's  management plan and financing. The EU said these discussions  should take priority given the need to process a large number of  projects in the next few years.

The contact group also identified the need to discuss baselines  and methodologies, including additionality and methodologies for  certain project types such as transport and energy efficiency. In  addition, the group highlighted participation and capacity  building issues, and identified LDCs, Africa, small-scale projects  and non-renewable biomass as areas needing discussion. The AFRICA  GROUP called for specific decisions on capacity building for  Africa, adding that the issue could also be discussed in the  contact group on capacity building under the Protocol.

During informal consultations held later in the day, Parties  considered a Co-Chairs' proposal, which has a preamble and five  general headings and addresses issues identified in the morning.  Delegates also heard a presentation on the proposal to channel 20  cents per CER to CDM administrative expenses.

### DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Having agreed to request  Parties' submissions to start a process on this issue, delegates  discussed whether to focus the submissions on technical issues or  to address policy issues as well. Most Parties supported a broader  approach, while the US preferred focusing on scientific, technical  and methodological issues under SBSTA. Emphasizing a preference  for a broader approach, TUVALU, supported by BRAZIL, CHINA,  SWITZERLAND and others, suggested referring the matter both to  SBSTA and SBI. Chair Hernán Carlino will prepare a draft COP  decision, which will be available before the next contact group  meeting on Monday, 5 December.

### EDUCATION, TRAINING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS (UNFCCC ARTICLE 6)

The  contact group reconvened on Thursday morning to discuss draft  conclusions developed by Chair D'Auvergne. Delegates approved  paragraphs on regional workshops, the New Delhi Work Programme on  Article 6, and financing. They also agreed to text requesting: a  synthesis report on recent workshops prior to SB 25; submissions  on the CC:iNet online information clearinghouse by 4 August 2006;  and a workshop on SIDS before SB 24. Several developing countries  noted the lack of internet access in some regions and the value  of national focal points. NAMIBIA suggested additional text on  this matter. Chair D'Auvergne said revised text would be ready  on Friday morning.

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION LOG

The Secretariat explained the  evolution of work on modalities of accounting of assigned amounts  since Decision 19/CP.7. He explained that this decision had been  formally adopted by COP/MOP 1 on Wednesday, when Parties adopted  the Marrakesh Accords. He outlined other decisions already taken  on this issue, including 16/CP.10, which sets out tasks for the  international transaction log administrator. Chair Murray Ward  (New Zealand) introduced a draft decision on the first annual  report of the administrator. Several Parties welcomed progress and  provided initial comments. A further meeting will be held.

### IPCC'S SPECIAL REPORT ON CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE

The  EU, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and others, proposed holding an  intersessional workshop to enable further discussion on carbon  dioxide capture and storage. The US said such a workshop should  focus on experiences. NORWAY, the EU and G-77/CHINA noted that  consideration of ocean storage is premature. AOSIS expressed  concern regarding the risks involved in carbon dioxide capture and  storage, and LIBYA said more research was needed. AUSTRALIA, with  the G-77/CHINA, stressed the need for demonstration projects in  both developed and developing countries. IRAN asked for inclusion  of such projects in the CDM, while CHINA said 'the door should be  left open' for this. Co-Chairs Agyemang-Bonsu and Verheye will  consult informally.

### JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (PROTOCOL ARTICLE 6)

Chair Stoycheva listed  issues on which COP/MOP 1 guidance to the JI Supervisory Committee  is needed, including funding and management, the use of CDM  baseline methodologies, the use of the CDM project design document  and designated operational entities (DOEs), and procedures for JI  projects already implemented.

The EU, supported by CANADA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and others,  emphasized that JI should start immediately and that lessons from  the CDM should be used as much as possible, including  accreditation of DOEs for JI. China, for the G-77/CHINA, noted  differences between CDM and JI, cautioning that DOEs and CDM  methodologies should not be applied automatically. Chair Stoycheva  said she would prepare a draft decision by Friday.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Implications of the CDM for Other  Environmental Treaties: Chair Børsting explained that, based on  Parties' submissions and views, three options to address perverse  incentives from the crediting of HFC-23 destruction had been  identified: to adopt principles that would apply to CDM baseline  methodologies; to agree on more specific measures to avoid  negative impacts of such projects undergoing the CDM approval  process; and to exclude HFC-23 destruction from crediting.  COLOMBIA, PERU and others supported exclusion, while CHINA, the  EU, CANADA, and others suggested considering various technical  options. Chair Børsting will prepare a draft text.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLE 3.9 (FUTURE COMMITMENTS)

Three submissions,  prepared by the G-77/China, EU and Japan, were presented.  Recalling the Berlin Mandate, the G-77/CHINA proposal calls for  an open-ended ad hoc group to consider further commitments from  Annex I countries with a view to adopting a result at COP/MOP 4.  The EU proposal recalls, inter alia, Protocol Article 9 (review  of the Protocol), decides to initiate consideration of Annex I  commitments in accordance with Article 3.9, and invites Parties to  make submissions for further consideration at SB 24. Also  recalling Article 9, Japan's proposal recognizes that the Protocol  is only a first step. Noting that emissions in non-Annex I  countries are growing rapidly, it proposes initiating further  consideration of Annex I commitments and preparing a review under  Article 9, and recommends that COP 12 starts a review of the  UNFCCC to construct an effective framework in which all Parties  participate.

Parties agreed on the importance of this issue for the legitimacy  of the Protocol and on the need to start a process with a clearly  defined timeline. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU and JAPAN,  requested that their proposal be used as the basis of  negotiations. The Co-Chairs will prepare a compilation document  for Saturday's contact group meeting.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Delegates presented initial  views on various issues, including FAO's standards for terrestrial  observations, the GCOS comprehensive report (requested by Decision  5/CP.10) and its timing, national communications' reporting  guidelines, oceanic observations, the need for data exchange and  international data exchange centers, a regional workshop  programme, and capacity building, particularly in Africa.  Co-Chairs Rösner and Gwage will prepare draft conclusions.

# INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Informal consultations were undertaken  throughout the day on various issues, including the Special  Climate Change Fund, the Adaptation Fund, the Report of the GEF,  and matters relating to implementation of Decision 5/CP.8. The  contact group will reconvene on Friday.

### MITIGATION

Some progress was reported on the Co-Chair's draft  text. However, no agreement was reached on an intersessional  workshop, and there was no discussion on lessons learned, which  will be considered in the contact group on Friday.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Informal discussions revolved around the  issue of whether to have a joint conclusion or two separate  conclusions for agenda items 8a (implementation of the framework)  and 8b (EGTT Work Plan), with the G-77/CHINA expressing concern  that separate conclusions may lead to separate agenda items for  technology transfer in the future. There was general agreement on  EGTT's 2006 Work Plan, except on the issue of public technologies.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The action on Thursday moved out of plenary and into contact  groups and informal consultations. Some issues - such as UNFCCC  Article 6 or the international transaction log - did not cause  much of a sensation outside the room. However, the group on  Protocol Article 3.9 (future commitments) held late in the evening  certainly did cause a stir in the corridors, not least because it  was so well attended that many could not even get through the  door. This is the issue one delegate dubbed, 'the 800 pound  sleeping gorilla we've all been trying not to wake!' However, with  three proposals already on the table and 300 delegates squeezing  into a room designed to hold about 100, the 'sleeping gorilla'  could be about to wake.
