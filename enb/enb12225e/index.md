# COP PLENARY

### REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS AND OF OTHER  PROVISIONS OF THE UNFCCC

National communications from  Annex I Parties: The EU and JAPAN reported on activities to  reduce emissions and noted progress in meeting their  Protocol targets. CANADA, AUSTRALIA and the US highlighted  domestic measures. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, BELARUS and  SLOVENIA said the decline in emissions in their countries  is due to the decoupling of GDP and emissions, and not due  to economic decline. The G-77/CHINA expressed concern over  the increase in Annex I emissions and appealed for  political commitment. ARGENTINA, opposed by the US,  questioned the appropriateness of the emissions intensity  measurement. SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, ALGERIA,  and OMAN noted concern over the impact of response measures  on developing countries.

AOSIS, with BANGLADESH, said that failure to mitigate  emissions has resulted in the need to increase adaptation  measures. ICELAND called for the application and transfer  of existing technologies, and SOUTH AFRICA called for  demonstrable leadership by Annex I Parties. Opposing US  climate policy, CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK called for the entry  into force of the Protocol. The CLIMATE ALLIANCE stressed  the need to include local and regional government P&Ms in  national communications. COP President Persányi said José Manuel Ovalle (Chile) and  Michael Zammit-Cutajar (Malta) would co-chair a contact  group on this issue.

### REPORT OF THE CDM EB

CDM EB Chair Hans Jürgen Stehr  presented a report on the activities of the EB. He noted  that nine proposals have been approved, and stressed the  importance of sustaining funding for activities of the EB.  The G-77/CHINA highlighted the need for equitable  geographic distribution of designated operational entities  (DOE) and financial and technical assistance to promote the  emergence of such entities in developing countries. With  GHANA, he underscored the importance of the sustainable  development objectives of CDM projects. SWITZERLAND  supported the continuation of creative proposals and ideas  for approaching the EB's tasks. JAPAN and the EU called for  accelerated project registration. ARGENTINA expressed  concern at the lengthy process for evaluating  methodologies.

Regarding transparency and attendance at EB meetings, the  US noted that the EB's Rules of Procedure provide for  attendance by all interested Parties, observers and  stakeholders. He said this implies physical presence in the  room, and urged the EB to reconsider its interpretation of  the Rules. A BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY representative called  for large-scale CDM projects, and CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK  urged equitable distribution of CDM projects, DOEs and  experts. Stressing the importance of forests for indigenous  peoples, an INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' ORGANIZATIONS  representative called for greater involvement by indigenous  peoples in negotiations on sinks in the CDM.

President Persányi said Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu) would  conduct informal consultations on this matter.

### JOINT STATEMENT

SWITZERLAND, on behalf of itself, Canada,  the EU, Iceland, New Zealand and Norway, reaffirmed the  political commitment made during COP-6 part II to provide  US$410 million to developing countries on an annual basis,  beginning in 2005. He noted that steps are being taken  toward fulfilling this commitment. SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Adoption of the agenda: Chair  Stoycheva opened the session, noting that, following  informal consultations, Parties had reached agreement on  the two agenda items held in abeyance. The SBI adopted the  agenda items, as amended.  Submission of second, and where appropriate, third national  communications: The EU emphasized the importance of an  efficient process for the preparation of non-Annex I  national communications. The US said that non-Annex I  national communications should be submitted no more than  four years after the submission of their initial  communications. In the case of communications from LDCs,  she said these should be submitted every five years.  Regarding the submission of greenhouse gas inventories, she  proposed that non-Annex I Parties should submit these every  two years, and that LDCs should submit inventories every  five years as part of their national communications. Chair  Stoycheva requested non-Annex I national communications  contact group Chair Sok Appadu to also consider this sub- item and prepare a draft COP decision. Progress on the implementation of activities under decision  5/CP.7: The EU, US and AUSTRALIA noted activities that have  taken place to implement decision 5/CP.7, including  workshops and the third GEF replenishment, and welcomed an  exchange of views on this issue during COP-9. Chair  Stoycheva said that Rob Mason (UK) and Al Waleed Al-Malik  (United Arab Emirates) would co-chair a contact group to  prepare a draft COP decision on the matter.

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### PROGAMME BUDGET FOR 2004-5

Chair John Ashe provided an  overview of previous discussions and options on the budget.  NEW ZEALAND emphasized the need for a budget that can  sustain high-priority work and encourages the Secretariat  to provide services that are innovative and efficient.  Supported by the G-77/CHINA and UGANDA, he favored the  budget option of a 9% increase. He also expressed support  for the inclusion of Kyoto Protocol development activities  in the core budget. The meeting was adjourned to allow  further consultations within the G-77/China.

### SCCF

Co-Chairs Rawleston Moore and Frode Neergaard  presented the Co-Chairs' draft COP decision for  consideration. NIGERIA, for the G-77/China, said the  decision could not be used as the basis of negotiation,  emphasizing that it did not contain sufficient guidance on  operational procedures, including a review process, and  that it lacked reference to the additionality of the funds.  He requested the Co-Chairs to prepare a new draft decision  and adjourn the meeting to allow the G-77/China time to  consult internally. While noting minor concerns over the  draft decision, the EU, CANADA and NORWAY said the draft  decision provides a good basis for negotiations. Following  a break for informal consultations by the G-77/China, the  Co-Chairs adjourned the meeting.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### IPCC TAR

Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the draft decision  and SBSTA conclusions on the IPCC TAR. Noting the need to  further discuss the themes and issues to be considered by  SBSTA under the two new agenda items, the G-77/CHINA  objected to forwarding the draft decision to the COP.  Opposing the G-77/China, AUSTRALIA, the EU, SWITZERLAND,  NORWAY, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and JAPAN emphasized the need to  begin work on the new agenda items, and noted the  importance for the COP to consider them. The EU said that  work on substance can be initiated, while further  considering specific themes and issues. CANADA emphasized  the need to avoid duplication of work, and to ensure a  Party-driven process. The EU highlighted that work under  the new agenda items will contribute to meeting the  UNFCCC's ultimate objective. GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE ON LULUCF: Co-Chair Audun Rosland  reported progress on the common reporting format and  announced that the EU, with the help of Canada, would  present reporting tables on sectoral background data for  LULUCF based on IPCC Good Practice Guidance (GPG). On  harvested wood products, delegates discussed the Co-Chairs'  draft conclusions, which invite submissions from Parties by  15 April 2004 in order to review the matter at SBSTA-21.  Text remains bracketed on the reference to taking the GPG  into consideration when making submissions.

### METHODOLOGICAL WORK

This group discussed the Co-Chair's  proposed elements for further discussion of a possible  SBSTA work programme, distinguishing new items from those  that are already being addressed under the UNFCCC or  elsewhere. The EU and NEW ZEALAND said discussions should  focus on core elements or themes. SAUDI ARABIA said  discussions must focus on methodological work for UNFCCC  implementation.

The EU, CANADA, and JAPAN, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the  G-77/CHINA, supported the exchange of information on, inter  alia, methods, models, and assumptions regarding  projections. SAUDI ARABIA said win-win aspects of good  practices in P&Ms in Annex I Parties and implementation of  UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects) should be  addressed. CANADA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, said  discussions on information, methods and tools for  socioeconomic scenario-building should be included, while  NEW ZEALAND suggested that the issue should be discussed  with 'projections' matters. The US and NEW ZEALAND, opposed  by the EU, said the Co-Chairs' proposal to include  discussions on information exchange regarding methodologies  for assessing mitigation and adaptation technologies  overlaps with SBSTA's ongoing work.

Recommending a focus beyond trade issues, CANADA, opposed  by SAUDI ARABIA and the EU, suggested that discussions on  cleaner or less-greenhouse gas-emitting energy should be  included. NEW ZEALAND, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, said  discussions on methodologies on the impact of  implementation of the Protocol should be included under the  'projections' topic. The EU, opposed by JAPAN, the US,  CANADA, CHINA, and NEW ZEALAND, urged discussions on  methodologies to determine Parties' contributions.

Regarding current and planned activities, NEW ZEALAND said  work on the exchange of information regarding the  implementation of national systems should be elaborated.  The Co-Chairs agreed to prepare draft conclusions.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

This group considered the Co-Chairs'  draft conclusions. The EU suggested forwarding the proposal  on guidance to the GEF to the SBI for consideration under  the agenda item on the SCCF, rather than to the SBI under  the agenda item on additional guidance to the GEF.  Following clarification by the Secretariat on the procedure  devised by SBI Chair Stoycheva for addressing relevant  information on guidance to the GEF arising in other contact  groups, Parties agreed to forward the proposal to the SBI  for consideration under the agenda item on the SCCF. CANADA  suggested, and Parties agreed, to note that work on  technology transfer undertaken by SBSTA complements work in  other fora. THAILAND stressed the need to invite relevant  organizations to provide information on technology needs.

# INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### SINKS IN THE CDM

Delegates discussed the option of  accounting for both positive and negative leakage, and  whether the crediting period should be limited to a  specific amount of time or allowed for renewal.  Negotiations continued throughout the day.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

After a cordial exchange of views in Wednesday's SCCF  contact group, what was meant to be a general round of  comments on the draft decision on Thursday ended in an  abrupt halt, with delegations expressing divergent views on  the next steps needed to operationalize the Fund, in  particular regarding the inclusion of obligations on  technology transfer in a voluntary fund. In a session that  mirrored discussions held at COP-8, it was clear that much  work remains to be done in order to deliver on the Delhi  decision to conclude the negotiations on the Fund during  COP-9, and thus initiate work on mobilizing resources to  deliver the Fund's ambitious scope of activities.  Interestingly, this comes 'hot on the heels' of the COP  Plenary announcement by Parties to the Bonn Declaration on  funding, that finance will be made available starting in  2005.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### SBI CONTACT GROUPS

Contact groups will convene on non- Annex I and Annex I national communications, the programme  budget for 2004-5, capacity building, the SCCF, and  implementation of decision 5/CP.7.

### SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

Contact groups will meet to discuss  R&SO, the IPCC TAR, methodological issues, sinks in the  CDM, and good practice guidance on LULUCF.
