# AWG-LCA WORKSHOP

AWG-LCA Chair Machado explained that the workshop was an opportunity to develop a common understanding of a shared vision. The Bahamas, for AOSIS, said a shared vision should prevent further impacts on SIDS and LDCs. He supported stabilization at 350 ppm and limiting the temperature increase to 1.5ºC, and called for mitigation by all parties. JAPAN proposed that parties adopt a global 50% reduction goal by 2050.

GHANA said a shared vision should address all elements of the Bali Action Plan, and not be temporarily limited in terms of actors and actions. BRAZIL said a shared vision should cover all building blocks, guided by the provisions and principles of the Convention. On mitigation, he supported 25-40% emission reductions by Annex I countries, substantial deviation from the baseline by non-Annex I countries, and burden sharing based on historical responsibility and equity. Bangladesh, for LDCs, said one of the key benchmarks for a shared vision should be that it minimizes the vulnerability of developing countries, LDCs and SIDS. The EU highlighted a pathway to below 2ºC, which requires at least a 50% reduction by 2050 compared with 1990 levels, and for developing countries to deviate from business-as-usual by 15-30% by 2020. Emphasizing historical responsibility, CHINA outlined criteria involving cumulative emissions and said developed countries should cut their emissions significantly to allow developing countries the space to develop. Speaking for a number of Latin American countries, ECUADOR said a shared vision should recognize the onus on all parties to step up their efforts, although developed countries must take the lead in mitigating climate change and provide adequate funding and technology transfer. The BAHAMAS highlighted mitigation efforts by AOSIS. SAUDI ARABIA supported India and Brazil, noting that it would be unacceptable to renegotiate the Convention, and criticized proposals focusing on the energy sector. JAPAN highlighted growing support for sectoral approaches. SOUTH AFRICA said the EU s 30% emission reduction target by 2020 was not sufficiently ambitious and questioned the scientific basis for a 15-30% deviation from business-as-usual for developing countries by 2020.

# INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

## AWG-KP FLEXIBLE MECHANISMS:

Parties generally expressed satisfaction with the Chair s note (FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/INF.3) and discussed how to develop it further. Some parties expressed concerns that the option of maintaining the current rules had been relegated to a footnote. Discussions were largely procedural addressing ways to ensure that the note adequately reflects all parties views.

## AWG-KP LULUCF:

Parties discussed how to move forward based on the LULUCF Annexes to previous AWG-KP reports (FCCC/KP/AWG/2008/3 and 5), and past and future party submissions. Parties then discussed, inter alia , natural disturbances, non-permanence under the CDM and further activities under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities). Further informal consultations will address submissions from the parties to clarify positions for next year.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The AWG-LCA workshop on a shared vision was a topic of conversation on Tuesday evening, with most participants apparently pleased with the event. While nobody claimed to have heard anything surprising, many felt that the workshop had fulfilled its objective. It generated a lot of discussion and there seemed to be more substance than before, said one observer. While some worried that differences were becoming more apparent, a few non-Annex I negotiators seemed satisfied that developing countries had all expressed similar ideas. We re all singing the same song, said one. Meanwhile, delegates in the AWG-KP were wondering how to move from compilations of views to text on LULUCF and the flexible mechanisms. LULUCF seems to be on its way to a negotiating text, but I m not sure how that s going to happen in the mechanisms group, said one participant. There s so much on the table and we aren t cutting any of it, said another. The first text is going to be a sea of brackets. On the SBI and SBSTA side, some participants seemed overwhelmed by the rapid pace of the discussions on Tuesday. A few were commenting on the Chairs attempts to defer substantive consideration of many agenda items to later SB sessions. They re trying to clear delegates plates so they can focus on the post-2012 negotiations and the Copenhagen deadline, observed one veteran. Finally, some delegates were noting the Bureau s decision to change the date for observing the Eid Al-Adha festival from Tuesday, 9 December to the previous day. This means no official meetings on either Sunday or Monday - two days in a row - which must be a first for the UNFCCC, said one delegate.
