# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Delegates met in a formal meeting and heard a presentation by the  G-77/CHINA on its views, contained in a new submission, on  consequences under a compliance regime. On facilitative  consequences, the G-77/CHINA reiterated that these should be  differentiated between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. On  enforcement consequences, she said these should only apply to  Annex I Parties. She then presented the proposed consequences, to  be decided by the enforcement branch, in case of non-compliance  with several provisions of the Protocol. In the case of non- compliance with Articles 5 and 7, the Party's eligibility to  participate in the mechanisms would be suspended and it would be  required to submit a plan including measures to remedy the non- compliance. One or more other measures, such as declaration of  non-compliance and suspension of rights and privileges, would be  decided. If a Party does not meet the eligibility requirements  under Articles 6 (JI), 12 (CDM) and 17 (emissions trading), its  eligibility to participate in the mechanisms would be suspended.  If the Party concerned is an Article 4 (joint fulfillment) Party,  the eligibility of the other Parties operating under that  provision would be suspended as well.

In case of non-compliance with Article 3.1 (assigned amounts -  AA), the G-77/CHINA said the strictest of measures should be  applied. She called for the combination of three consequences for  the non-compliant Party in order to ensure effectiveness and avoid  loopholes: a contribution to the Compliance Fund, to be  established; the deduction from its AA in the subsequent  commitment period with a penalty rate; and a submission of a  Compliance Action Plan. Additional consequences could also be set.  In the case of non-compliance with Article 3.14 (adverse effects),  the Party concerned would be required to commit itself to an  'Article 3.14 Plan' indicating the measures intended to be  implemented in order to resolve the issue in question, and it  could be subjected to the suspension of rights and privileges.

SAUDI ARABIA, on behalf of the ARABIAN COUNTRIES GROUP, said non- compliance with Article 3.14 should also lead to suspension of  eligibility to participate in the mechanisms and a financial  penalty paid to a compensation fund. NEW ZEALAND questioned the  aspects of establishing an action plan as well as a compliance  fund, since these would remove the stringency of the consequences  by extending the period of non-compliance and adding complexity.

Participants then met in 'informal informal' consultations in the  evening and late in the night, in an attempt to make further  progress. They worked on the basis of a revised Co-Chairs' text  and the latest G-77/CHINA submission that contains proposals on a  plenary, the submission of questions of implementation, appeal,  COP/MOP and consequences. Based on the discussions, the Co-Chairs  will develop a revised text by Friday 12.00 noon.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Economies in Transition (EITs): Delegates met  briefly in a contact group to consider the remaining brackets in  the draft decision on capacity building in EITs. They removed  brackets around reference to Protocol Article 10 (existing  commitments) in the preamble, noting that this Article refers to  all Parties. However, they retained brackets around paragraphs  addressing financial support for the implementation of the  framework, pending the outcome of discussions in the group on the  financial mechanism. The contact group agreed to forward the text  with the remaining brackets to the subsidiary bodies.

Developing countries: Delegates met in 'informal informal'  consultations throughout the day to work on bracketed paragraphs  in the draft decision and proposed framework text. They agreed to  defer the paragraphs on financing and the role of the GEF to the  contact group addressing the financial mechanism. They removed  brackets on a number of paragraphs in the draft decision. However,  differences remained over who would monitor and review progress of  implementation of the decision, and at what intervals. 'Informal  informal' consultations continued late into the night.

### MECHANISMS

The contact group on mechanisms met to receive  feedback from Chair Chow on 'informal informal' discussions that  had focused on Article 12 (CDM). Revised text was circulated on:  the role of the COP/MOP, the Executive Board, the accreditation  body, designated operational entities, participation, financing,  monitoring, verification, certification, issuance of CERs,  standards and procedures for the accreditation of operational  entities, a CDM reference manual, and a project design document.  Emphasizing that negotiations need to be completed by midnight on  Friday, 17 November, he urged the group to show leadership in  completing their discussions in a timely manner.

The 'informal informal' discussions, comprising representatives  from approximately 30 Parties, continued throughout the afternoon  and late into the night, with the aim of seeking as much  convergence as possible on the remaining text relating to the CDM,  JI, emissions trading and registries. It is understood that while  progress has been made in reaching some agreement, fundamental  differences on a number of core issues remain.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Delegates met in two  drafting groups and a contact group to work on developing  consensus text on the framework for meaningful and effective  actions to enhance the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5  (development and transfer of technologies).

In a morning session of the second drafting group, which worked on  the themes of capacity building and mechanisms for technology  transfer, a smaller group was convened to discuss and propose text  on the implementation of capacity building in the context of  technology transfer.

The contact group then convened in the afternoon to consider and  adopt the consensus text from the first group working on the three  themes of technology needs and needs assessment, technology  information, and enabling environment. Rather than singling out  developing country Parties or countries with economies in  transition, the contact group decided to make reference to  'Parties other than developed country Parties and other developed  Parties not included in Annex II, particularly developing country  Parties.' The three sections were then agreed upon.

Co-Chair Cooper noted that consultations were ongoing on the  framework text in order to achieve consensus language. She then  introduced a Co-Chairs' proposal for a draft decision to which the  framework would be annexed for consideration by the group.

The contact group then reconvened in a closed evening session and  focused on the remaining sections on capacity building and  mechanisms for technology transfer. Delegates debated whether  language used in the framework should be obligatory, that is,  whether to use 'shall' or 'are encouraged to.' The group then  considered the mechanisms for technology transfer. There was  divergence over the need for, and composition and functions of,  the proposed intergovernmental panel of experts or advisory group  of experts. The group continued its work late into the night. It  was expected that on completion of the work on the framework,  delegates would begin considering a Co-Chairs' proposal for a  draft decision on technology transfer.

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Delegates convened in this contact  group to continue discussions on the elements for a draft decision  on P&Ms. The group agreed to delete text on a draft decision that  the task on P&Ms required under the Buenos Aires Plan of Action  has been completed. On the decision that future work should take  place through initiatives involving all Parties and should include  the exchange of information on P&Ms, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by  CANADA, emphasized that the information should relate to the P&Ms  of Annex I Parties. Other text that was bracketed included: SAUDIA  ARABIA's proposed reference to methodological issues related to  assessing the effectiveness 'and impact' of P&Ms; a reference  proposed by the US to 'assessing/characterizing' the effectiveness  of P&Ms; and the EU's reference to the future 'structured' work on  P&Ms.

On text requesting the Secretariat to make available information  on P&Ms related to the future work on P&Ms as reported in the  national communications by Annex I Parties, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed  by the US, JAPAN and CANADA, urged reference to information on  P&Ms implemented and planned 'under the Convention and its  Protocol.' This was bracketed. On the decision requesting the  Secretariat to organize the first workshop and report the results  to COP-7, AUSTRALIA included reference to 'side events.' Regarding text requesting the SBSTA to consider the results  obtained from the actions taken and to report them to COP-7, with  a view to taking a decision in the lead-up to the COP/MOP, the US  urged that the entire decision be bracketed. Delegates agreed to  further consult on the text. On the draft decision inviting  Parties to provide the necessary financial support for the  workshops and other activities, the G-77/CHINA said this refers to  Annex I Parties. The US proposed also inviting 'interested  international organizations.' Both proposals were bracketed.

Regarding the decision that future work should enable an  assessment of demonstrable progress of Annex I Parties in  achieving their Protocol commitments, the G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA  and the EU underlined the importance of this issue. The US stated  that it was unable to continue discussion on this issue pending  the outcome of deliberations in other contact groups. CANADA  proposed deleting the decision. Delegates agreed to defer  discussion on this issue. On the chapeau, the US, CANADA,  AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed deleting  reference to specific provisions of the UNFCCC.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

The Friends of the Chair met twice to continue  discussing the draft decision.  Delegates accepted a proposal by  the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) to integrate text on special  treatment for LDCs into the adverse effects section of the draft  decision. Discussion on the proposed adaptation fund and the fund  supporting specific concerns of LDCs was referred to the financial  mechanisms group.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Co-Chair Plume introduced a working  paper proposed by the Co-Chairs and explained the changes made to  the previous version of the guidelines under Articles 5, 7 and 8.   She suggested that Parties present their views on the new text and  then focus on the draft decisions. Following a question by the US  on the way to proceed, she said COP-6 President Pronk had made  clear that there would be no contact groups the following week.

Delegates welcomed the efforts made by the Co-Chairs in preparing  the working paper. However, they highlighted a number of issues  with which they had some concerns, including: reporting on  domestic programmes; reporting on Articles 10 (existing  commitments), and 11 (financial mechanisms); the lifting of  brackets around Article 3.3 and 3.4; reference to 'initial AA';  review of information on Article 3.14; and institutional  arrangements for expert review teams.

On elements related to good practice guidance and adjustments  under Article 5.2 (adjustments), the G-77/CHINA suggested  bracketing text on estimates of emissions and removals from LULUCF  as the discussions in the group on LULUCF had not been concluded.   NEW ZEALAND, with the EU, US and JAPAN, emphasized that such  estimates from all sectors should be prepared under good practice  guidance, and be adjusted when they are not prepared according to  the agreed methodologies.  In elements for a draft COP/MOP-1  decision on this matter, the EU, SWITZERLAND and NORWAY disagreed  over a US proposal, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, NEW ZEALAND and  AUSTRALIA, to include text on ensuring that adjustment procedures  are conservative so that Parties would not be unduly penalised.   The Co-Chairs requested interested Parties to meet to further  discuss the unresolved paragraphs.

### LULUCF

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson said this contact group meeting  would be devoted to providing technical advice on inclusion of  sinks under the mechanisms, and stressed that the actual decision  on inclusion would be taken by the mechanisms group.

COLOMBIA presented their proposal on Expiring Certified Emissions  Reductions (CERs). Noting that permanence is the main problem  related to LULUCF activities, he suggested all LULUCF projects be  treated as potentially non-permanent, and said that associated  CERs should expire after a specific time period, after which they  would be replaced by permanent CERs or new expiring CERs. The  project proponent would be fully liable for the CERs.

TUVALU highlighted recent research results from the Hadley Centre  suggesting that the terrestrial biosphere may shift from being a  sink to a source. He stressed problems related to reversibility of  carbon sequestration, leakage, uncertainty related to accounting  methodologies, and negative environmental and social impacts  including perverse incentives for conversion of native systems to  plantation forestry. He cautioned that the potential scale of  LULUCF activities could undermine any incentives to find long-term  solutions to emissions reductions.

Noting the large share of global emissions resulting from  deforestation, BOLIVIA supported conservation of existing forests  under the CDM. He cautioned against perverse incentives to cut  forests, and said that for many countries forest conservation  would be the main way to participate in efforts to stabilize the  global climate.

Expressing concern with the interventions of delegates, Co-Chairs  Thorgeirsson and Gwage appealed to delegates to focus on technical  aspects with a view to providing advice to the contact group on  mechanisms. The G-77/CHINA urged no prejudgement on the issue of  sinks in the CDM. He drew attention to the Group's principle on  permanence, underlining that sinks provide temporary removal only.  The EU expressed surprise at the Co-Chair's request to provide  solutions, saying that he was not convinced that solutions exist.  He argued that inclusion of sinks would reduce the transfer of  emission reduction technology to developing countries. COSTA RICA  argued that global leakage would be a significant problem should  LULUCF activities not be allowed under the CDM, as timber stocks  in different parts of the world are linked through the global  market, and a small shift of logging activities from Annex I  countries to non-Annex I countries would lead to a proportionally  larger increase in loss of carbon.

SENEGAL, BHUTAN, AUSTRALIA, INDONESIA and MEXICO, opposed by the  EU and CHINA, outlined arguments in favor of the Colombian  proposal. CHINA underlined that there was no unified G-77/CHINA  position on this proposal.

AUSTRALIA expressed concern with the unbalanced use by delegates  of the IPCC report on LULUCF, and noted that the report shows that  methodologies exist or are being developed regarding leakage,  additionality, permanence and measurement uncertainty. With JAPAN,  she questioned why the issue of scale is specifically raised in  the context of LULUCF projects, arguing that the institutional  infrastructure will ensure that LULUCF projects are additional,  measurable and verifiable. COLOMBIA emphasized that the aim of its  proposal is not to transfer Annex I commitments. He underlined the  value of procedures being proposed in the mechanisms group to  ensure stakeholder participation within forestry projects.

CANADA said there are solutions to the problem of permanence,  highlighting risk management options. The US pointed out that  projects differ in terms of how prone they are to leakage, and  stressed that the scale of actual LULUCF projects implemented is  constrained by institutional and economic barriers.

In addition, the Indigenous Peoples Caucus on Climate Change gave  a statement stressing the need to consider indigenous peoples and  their needs and rights on the lands being discussed in the LULUCF  contact group, and condemning the inclusion of sinks under the  CDM.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Participants met in closed 'informal  informal' consultations to continue discussing text providing  additional guidance to the operating entity of the financial  mechanism. Delegates agreed to remove brackets from some text.  However, disagreement remained over text relating to the provision  of GEF resources for country-driven Stage II adaptation  activities, particularly the extent to which such activities are  based on assessments reported in national communications. In  addition, some text that has linkages to issues under  consideration in the adverse effects contact group remain  bracketed.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With less than one day remaining before President Pronk's strictly  mandated deadline for agreeing on 'technical' matters, observers  speculated whether the issues that would be forwarded to ministers  next week would be predominately political, or whether many  technical issues would remain. They suggest key issues likely to  require high-level decisions include Protocol Article 3.14, the  adoption of the compliance regime, supplementarity, and sinks  issues, such as the limitation of credits, the question of sinks  under the mechanisms, and additional activities under Protocol  Article 3.4. The amount of funding and methods for channeling such  funding is also likely to feature highly on next week's agenda.
