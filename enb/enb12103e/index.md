# SBI

On administrative and financial matters, Chair Kante invited  delegates to consider the following agenda items together: the  programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001; income and budget  performance in the biennium 1998-99; and arrangements for  administrative support to the Convention.

Many delegates said they did not support the proposed 50% budget  increase or the proposed 59% rise in the number of staff. The G-77/CHINA stated that, although it has often been a proponent of  strong and steady growth in Conventions' budgets, it cannot  support the extent of the proposed increase, and noted the  current trend among many Parties to support zero-growth budgets.  He expressed concern that budget proposals anticipated outcomes  of COP decisions that had not yet been made. The EU, supported  by the US, CANADA and RUSSIA, suggested that the Secretariat  could prepare several other options for a draft budget. He  proposed scenarios based on increases of 0%, 5% and 7.5% per  annum, and suggested deferring a decision on the budget until  COP-5. The US and CANADA preferred resolving the issue at this  session, given COP-5's heavy workload.

RUSSIA drew participants' attention to political realities,  stating that it would be very difficult to justify asking for  such a substantial increase in funding from decision makers back  in delegates' respective countries. CANADA emphasized that the  Secretariat should focus on its facilitative function. IRAN  suggested that the Secretariat provide at least two reports on  biennium budgets, thus allowing later drafts to take into  account additional expenses resulting from COP decisions. He  expressed concern over the number of consultants hired and the  criteria applied to their selection. The PHILIPPINES noted that  a budget increase does not necessarily benefit the Parties. She  said greater South-South coordination on capacity building could  take some pressure off the Secretariat.

In reference to certain programme activities outlined in the  budget, CHINA stated that the Secretariat was not mandated to  provide policy guidance to Parties but rather the other way  around. He noted the need for the budget to reflect the clean  development mechanism (CDM) as a priority. EGYPT pointed to  streamlining FCCC programme activities with those undertaken in  other fora as a means to reduce expenditures. INDIA inquired  about the Secretariat's policies on gratis personnel and  suggested that the Secretariat prepare a table comparing the  proposed budget to previous ones.

On contingencies for conference services, the G-77/CHINA said  the UN General Assembly (UNGA) should be asked to include the  FCCC's requirements in its budget. The US said Parties should  pay for conference servicing, and suggested requesting the UNGA  to take a decision on this matter.

Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary of the FCCC,  referred to the Secretariat's predicament when preparing the  budget given that it had not received guidance from the Parties.  He said this discussion would help remedy this lack of guidance  and noted that the proposed budget for the 2000-2001 biennium  followed previously used methodology. He noted difficulties in  preparing a table or chart allowing comparisons of activities  from biennium to biennium. He emphasized that while delegations  did not agree to a 50% budget increase, most had acknowledged  the increase in the Secretariat's workload. He suggested  delegates consider deferring consideration of anticipated  budgetary outcomes of upcoming COP-6 decisions until COP-6.

# SBSTA

The Subsidiary Body on Scientific and Technological Advice  (SBSTA) met to continue consideration of development and  transfer of technology. On regional workshops to be organized by  the Secretariat, JAPAN announced that it would give US$100,000  for the Asia and Pacific workshop. He noted the important input  the forthcoming IPCC Special Report will make to the  Consultative Process on development and transfer of technology  and stressed the need for close coordination between SBSTA and  the IPCC.

The G-77/CHINA, with NIGERIA and CHINA, underscored the  importance of technology transfer to developing countries. While  recognizing the difficulties of making it work outside open  market mechanisms, he reiterated that technology transfer could  not be undertaken under the market process. He stressed the need  to address technology transfer in the broadest sense and  incorporate elements of capacity building, public awareness,  installation and smooth transfer from the donor to the  recipient. He highlighted the need for rules and procedures to  govern the transfer of technology and called for an increase in  the Secretariat's budgetary allocation to fund capacity building  for technology transfer.

CANADA stated that technology transfer is critical to achieving  the long-term goals of the Convention and Protocol. She  described the private sector as the main vehicle for the  transfer and said the challenge is to create an enabling  environment and implement enabling activities leading to  continuous transfer. She added that investments associated with  the mechanisms (CDM and JI) will be instrumental in the transfer  of efficient and effective climate change technology to non- Annex I Parties and economies in transition. CHINA cautioned  against redefining technology transfer and stressed that  transfer under the Convention should occur on non-commercial  terms. She said existing transfers of technology were inadequate  to meet the objectives of the Convention and stated that the  main barrier is the political will of developed countries.  Regarding technology transfer under the CDM, she said this  should be additional to that occurring under the Convention.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

The contact group on Annex I Party national communications met  to consider draft guidelines for reporting on non-inventory  issues. The group adopted a number of amendments to the text  that had been drafted at an earlier workshop held in Bonn. There  was a divergence of views regarding whether Parties should  include gross domestic product (GDP) and greenhouse gas  emissions measurements per capita in their national  communications. The paragraphs including such reference were  bracketed and deferred to a smaller group for consideration.  Delegates also discussed the use of the terms 'should' and  'shall' in the draft guidelines. They agreed to bracket them  pending further discussion.

The informal consultation on research and systematic observation  met to discuss and make largely textual amendments to a Chair's  draft of conclusions for SBSTA. The conclusions recognize the  continued degradation of observation capacity in developing  countries; urge Parties to provide enhanced support to capacity  building; and require the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)  Secretariat to prepare regional implementation plans and options  for improving observation capacity. Delegates pointed out the  lack of emphasis on research in the conclusions and decided to  make it clear that only systematic observation was covered. They  decided to reconvene on Friday to discuss a revised draft.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While negotiators report that they are in Bonn to, among other  things, work out the operational details of the Kyoto  mechanisms, some NGO analysts have suggested that debates  continue to reflect a lack of resolution on the bigger political  questions. In discussions on LULUCF and the revision of  guidelines for national reporting by Annex I Parties, observers  detect that overarching political debates about where the burden  of responsibility for tackling GHG emissions should lie continue  to skew interventions.
