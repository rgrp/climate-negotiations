# MINISTERIAL SEGMENT

### REPUBLIC OF KOREA

### ZIMBABWE

Denis R. Norman, Minister of Transport and Energy, said there is a need for additional commitments without shifting them to developing countries. MALTA: Minister of the Environment Dr. Stanley Zammit called for a protocol by 1997. JI is a potentially important instrument but should not become a loophole to avoid commitments.

### AUSTRIA

Maria Rauch-Kallat, Federal Minister for Environmental Affairs, supported negotiation of a protocol that includes targets and timetables for all GHGs. Austria cannot support JI credits for constructing nuclear power plants. MARSHALL ISLANDS: Tom D. Kijiner, Minister of Health and the Environment, said the main issue is the survival of his country.

CZECH REPUBLIC: Frantisek Benda, Minister of the Environment, supported international cooperation and said JI could produce implementation policies and measures.

### INDIA

Kamal Nath, Minister for the Environment, rejected  the 'insidious moves' to divide the developing countries into separate categories. India is willing to accept a JI pilot phase with no credits if it is not an excuse to continue present consumption patterns. BOLIVIA: Oscar Paz Rada, Representative of the Minister for Sustainable Development, said it is vitally important that developed countries reduce emissions and that technology transfer provisions be implemented. CHINA: Chen Yao Bang, Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee, said that China has set up a special body for the Convention's implementation. He called on developed countries to fulfill their commitments, including provision of financial resources.

### SWEDEN

Mans Lonroth, Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, said Swedish CO2 emissions have been reduced by 40% through energy efficiency. GREECE: Elissavet Papazoi, Deputy Minister of Environment Physical Planning and Public Works, stressed the need for a breakthrough in the development of renewable energies.

### JAMAICA

Donald Mills, Special Adviser on International Environmental Matters, expressed serious concern at the reluctance of some to take necessary action. KUWAIT: Dr. Abdulrahman Al-Muhailan, Minister of Health, said decisions should not rush forward but be on solid scientific foundations. Kuwait has supported steady steps that may seem limited to some, and has supported the countries most subject to harm from economic and social consequences. UZBEKISTAN: Victor E. Chub, Chief of Glavgidromet, reviewed problems associated with desertification in Uzbekistan.

### HUNGARY

Dr. Katalin Szili, Secretary of State for the Environment, said the precautionary principle should be the governing factor in strengthening the commitments under the Convention. BAHRAIN: Amb. Ahmad Abbas Ahmad said the implementation of precautionary measures should not negatively affect economies of developing countries, especially those based on fossil fuel exports.

Mulondo, Minister of State for Natural Resources, cautioned that JI could shift the responsibilities from developed to developing countries.

### MOZAMBIQUE

Dr. Bernardo Pedro Ferraz, Minister for Coordination of Environmental Affairs, supported a JI pilot phase. PORTUGAL: Teresa Gouveia, Minister of Environment and Natural Resources, stressed incorporation of environmental concerns in national development plans. SYRIA: Minister of State for the Environment Abdelhamid Al-Munajed said Parties have a duty to adopt precautionary measures. Developed countries need to provide technology and funds.

### SAUDI ARABIA

Abdulbar Algain, President of the Meteorology and Environmental Protection Administration, said the Convention should not impede progress by considering emissions reductions. Reductions would require impossible energy efficiency, intolerable investment levels and limited growth. CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: Martin Gbafolo, Minister of Waters, Forests, Hunting, Fishing, Tourism and the Environment, said development is the priority in Africa. CAR is a real sink for CO2 emissions. MALI: Mohamed Ag Erlaf, Minister of Public Works and Transport, said Mali has only minor CO2 emissions and no important sinks. He suggested moving the Desertification Convention secretariat to Bonn.

### NEPAL

Amb. Durgesh Man Singh said the solution to climate change lies in global partnership. All Parties must act so that future generations will not suffer. PERU: Amb. Luis Silva Santisteban said a mandate for a protocol was needed. He said a pilot phase for JI should be launched and added that the Convention needs the cooperation of developed countries.

### CHILE

Amb. Jorge Berguno stated that while the Conference has produced solid steps forward, much remains to be done. He supported a JI pilot phase. CROATIA:  Vladimir Krtalic, Deputy Minister of Physical Planning, Building and Housing, stated that Croatia receives more pollution than it generates. However, Croatia will commit itself to the Convention to the extent possible. SLOVENIA: Dr. Pavel  Gantar, Minister of Environment and Physical Planning, said a response to climate change should be developed as soon as possible.

### TOGO

Yao Dao Felli, Minister of Rural Development, Environment and Tourism, said countries must seek solutions to avoid environmental Armageddon. Africa must be helped by avoiding technology transfer harmful for its development. MONACO: Amb. Bernard Fautrier said Monaco will reduce emissions to 1990 levels or lower by 2000. Monaco is meeting its commitments, but because 20% of its territory is at sea level, it appreciates the need for international action.

# COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

The final meeting of the COW took place at 9:30 pm to adopt a number of decisions, including FCCC/CP/1995/L.13 on activities implemented jointly under the pilot phase; FCCC/CP/1995/L.12 on the location of the Permanent Secretariat in Bonn; and FCCC/CP/1995/L.10 on transfer of technology. Brazil noted that it had made major concessions and the COP should look carefully at activities implemented jointly whenever they involve Annex I and non-Annex I countries. Claiming credit for cooperation is something that runs the risk of destroying the concept that countries are responsible for their national emissions. The Chair forwarded a number of documents related to the budget to the drafting group on budget to consider when it met at 10:30 pm. The Executive Secretary also noted that the budget figures will be revised since the Secretariat will be in Bonn.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### PLENARY

The Plenary is scheduled to meet from 11:00 am -1:00 pm and again from 3:00 - 6:00 pm. There is a possibility that the morning meeting may be canceled if documentation is not complete or if more time is needed for consultations following Thursday night's 11:00 pm ministerial meeting on the adequacy of commitments.
