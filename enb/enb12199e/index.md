SBSTA did not reach agreement on the IPCC TAR, or on elements of  cooperation with relevant international organizations, and will  reconvene to take up these matters on Friday.

# SBSTA

## METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES:

###     Greenhouse Gas Inventories:

Chair  Thorgeirsson asked contact group Co-Chair Newton Paciornik  (Brazil) to report on draft conclusions on guidelines on reporting  and review of greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I Parties  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.5 and Add.1 and Add.2). Co-Chair Paciornik  noted that the group had eliminated redundancies and identified  gaps in the guidelines, leading to more consistent, accurate and  complete greenhouse gas inventories. The SBSTA adopted the  conclusions, which include annexes containing two draft COP-8  decisions on revisions to the guidelines for the preparation of  Annex I national communications, and on revisions to the UNFCCC  guidelines for the technical review of Annex I greenhouse gas  inventories. SWITZERLAND noted the absence of principles on carbon  storage reporting, and accounting of assigned amounts under the  Protocol, and Chair Thorgeirsson said the matter would be noted in  the session's report.

###     Articles 5, 7 and 8:

Contact group Co-Chair Festus Luboyera (South  Africa) noted that the contact group had considered all issues  under the agenda item and produced SBSTA conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.6 and Add.1). He said the group had approved a  draft COP-8 decision on demonstrable progress, and that a draft  COP-8 decision including guidelines for the reinstatement of  eligibility to use the mechanisms had been agreed, with the  exception of the time frames. Murray Ward (New Zealand) reported  on informal consultations he had conducted on technical standards  for registries, and said a document would be available later in  the day. SBSTA adopted the conclusions in their entirety.

### AIJ

Contact group Co-Chair Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso) noted  that the group had met twice formally and once informally, and had  concluded discussion of the revised uniform reporting format  (URF). He introduced the draft conclusions and draft COP-8  decision, including the revised URF annexed to the decision  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.2 and Add. 1). Delegates adopted the  conclusions, with an amendment to the title of the part of the URF  on capacity building and technology transfer.

###     Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF:

Chair Thorgeirsson presented  draft conclusions on the development of good practice guidance and  other information for LULUCF (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.2). The  conclusions, which welcome progress made by the IPCC in the  development of LULUCF good practice guidance and in the completion  of its work by COP-9 (11/CP.7), were adopted without amendment.

###     LULUCF under the CDM:

Contact group Co-Chair Karsten Sach  (Germany) said the group had produced and agreed on the TOR and  agenda for work on definitions and modalities for afforestation  and reforestation under the CDM during the first commitment  period. He introduced the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.8),  which the SBSTA adopted after including some minor editorial  changes. TUVALU expressed disappointment that the SBSTA had failed  to agree on the definitions on afforestation and reforestation,  noting that these definitions had been adopted in a COP-7 decision  (11/CP.7). He stated that if the COP-7 decision is reopened then  he would introduce a number of new definitions under Protocol  Article 3.3 and 3.4 (LULUCF).

## TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Chair Thorgeirsson explained that he had  asked Terry Carrington (UK) and Philip Gwage (Uganda) to prepare  draft conclusions on this item in consultation with interested  Parties. Terry Carrington informed the SBSTA that four meetings  had been convened to consider the reports of two relevant  workshops (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.6 and INF.7) and the proposed work  programme for the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) for  2002-2003 (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.1). He highlighted useful  discussions on the EGTT's work, and said this had resulted in  several modifications to the work programme, which appears as an  annex to the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.9). Parties then  adopted the draft conclusions.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OZONE AND CLIMATE EFFORTS

Chair Thorgeirsson  indicated that informal conclusions had been conducted by Richard  Bradley (US), who then briefed Parties on these discussions,  noting agreement on the value of a balanced information package  and a process for recommending a draft decision at SB-17 for COP- 8. He informed the SBSTA that agreement had been reached the  previous night, with the exception of a G-77/CHINA proposal to  amend three references in the text to relate specifically to  'Annex I' Parties.

Following further informal consultations on this proposal, Richard  Bradley reported on a compromise whereby reference to Annex I  Parties had been inserted in one paragraph, while another  paragraph had been altered to encourage government-stakeholder  dialogue to advance information sharing 'regarding replacement  options for ozone-depleting substances in a manner that  contributes to the objectives of the Montreal Protocol and the  UNFCCC.' In another paragraph, the reference to Parties had been  removed so that only 'relevant organizations' were encouraged to  make policy-neutral information available. The SBSTA adopted the  draft conclusions, as amended.

## POLICIES AND MEASURES

Contact group Co-Chair Pierre Giroux  (Canada) reported agreement in the group on text for the draft  conclusions, with the exception of a paragraph proposed by the G-77/China on principles for addressing P&Ms, which remained  bracketed. Following further consultations, Chair Thorgeirsson  reported that a compromise had been reached, with the proposed  paragraph on principles and another referring to paragraphs 1-5 of  the relevant COP-7 decision (13/CP.7) being removed, and a new  paragraph being inserted. He explained that this new paragraph  states that 'the SBSTA concluded that consideration of further  action on this agenda item shall be based on the approaches  outlined in decision 13/CP.7.' The draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.10) were adopted, as amended.

## INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

### Cooperation with Scientific  Organizations:

Chair Thorgeirsson recalled that informal  consultations had been conducted by Sue Barrell (Australia) and  David Lesolle (Botswana). Sue Barrell informed delegates that the  meetings had resulted in draft conclusions that included agreement  on the urgency of implementing action plans developed from  regional workshops, and that identified priority areas of concern  in the global monitoring systems for climate. Delegates adopted  the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.3) without amendment.

###     Cooperation with Other Conventions:

On cooperation with other conventions, Chair Thorgeirsson noted that Clare Breidenich (US)  and Yvette Aguilar (El Salvador) had convened informal  consultations. Clare Breidenich said the discussions had concluded  with agreement on draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.3), which  included text reconfirming the mandate of the Joint Liaison Group  (JLG) of the UNFCCC, Convention on Biological Diversity and UN  Convention to Combat Desertification. The SBSTA adopted the draft  conclusions.

###     Cooperation with UN Bodies:

Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the  draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.4). The US said he  preferred deferring consideration of the methodological aspects  related to emissions from international transport from SB-17 to  SB-18. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by MAURITIUS for the G-77/CHINA,  said Parties should respect the 'gentleman's agreement' with ICAO,  and should only take up methodological issues further if ICAO  considers that SBSTA has the expertise to do so. The EU disagreed  with this position. Chair Thorgeirsson recalled a COP-5 decision  (18/CP.5) requesting SBSTA to continue its work on methodological  issues relating to fuel use in international transport. The G-77/CHINA suggested adding a paragraph in which SBSTA would bring  to the attention of ICAO and IMO the fact that non-Annex I Parties  do not have greenhouse gas reduction targets.  SBSTA was suspended  for informal discussions with a view to reaching consensus on the  draft conclusions.

Upon reconvening, the US read proposed text replacing the disputed  paragraph that sets the timeframe for consideration of the matter  for SB-18. SAUDI ARABIA disagreed with the timeframe and suggested  SB-20. Discussion on the issue was deferred until Friday.

## ARTICLE 6

Contact group Co-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele  (Belgium) presented the results of his group's work on preparing a  work programme on Article 6 and introduced the draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.11 and Add. 1). He noted the lack of attention  to the Article 6 in the UNFCCC process. On future work, he said  Parties would be invited to submit views on the work programme by  20 August for compilation into a miscellaneous document for  further consideration at SBSTA-17, and for possible adoption at  COP-8. Co-Chair S. N. Sok Appadu (Mauritius) appealed to Parties  to send comments and complete their work in a timely manner.  BOTSWANA, for the G-77/CHINA, proposed an amendment to the  conclusions to reaffirm the need for a work programme, taking into  account national circumstances and the availability of resources.  He also requested that the conclusions be amended to reflect that  the SBSTA 'took note of,' rather than 'formulated,' the annexed  draft decision on the Article 6 work programme. The SBSTA adopted  the conclusions as amended.

## OTHER MATTERS

### Special Circumstances of Croatia:

On special  circumstances of Croatia under Convention Article 4.6 (flexibility  for EITs) Co-Chair Jim Penman (UK) introduced draft conclusions,  noting that the contact group had considered methodological  issues. SBSTA adopted the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.7)  without amendment, forwarding the matter to SBSTA-17 for further  consideration, with a view to advising the SBI at its seventeenth  session.

Cleaner or Less Greenhouse Gas-Emitting Energy: Chair Thorgeirsson  introduced draft conclusions on this matter  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.5), which the SBSTA adopted as presented.

Implementation of Article 2.3: On Protocol Article 2.3, Chair  Thorgeirsson indicated that Parties had reached consensus, and the  draft conclusions were adopted without amendment  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.6).

### IPCC TAR

Chair Thorgeirsson asked the Co-Chairs of the contact  group to report on their work. Co-Chair David Warrilow said  'excellent' progress had been made in six open meetings and two  closed informal consultations. He said some paragraphs remained  bracketed, however, and noted that one Party had proposed an  addition that had not been supported in the group.

Chair Thorgeirsson read a modified version of a paragraph inviting  the SBI to consider the TAR in its guidance to the financial  mechanism, and invited Parties to adopt the conclusions. The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported by UKRAINE and opposed by the US,  proposed the inclusion of additional text in which SBSTA draws  'attention to the need for additional research on concentration of  greenhouse gases which might have an impact on the climate change  system.' SAUDI ARABIA said the process of negotiation in the contact group  had been unfair, and objected to the document on principle. Chair  Thorgeirsson said concerns about negotiating procedure should be  raised in SBI, not in SBSTA. He requested the contact group Co- Chairs to reconvene in informal negotiations and report back to  SBSTA on Friday.

## IN THE CORRIDORS

On the meeting's penultimate day, many observers were disappointed  that the SBSTA failed to conclude as scheduled. Once again, the  politicization of a supposedly technical meeting nearly ran  discussions into the ground. One participant commented on the  inseparability of politics and science, noting the great  controversy surrounding the TAR. Others remarked that certain  lobbyists, seen in intense discussion with a number of  delegations, might have 'thrown a spanner in the works.'
