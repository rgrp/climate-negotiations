# POLICIES AND MEASURES

AGBM Chair Ra√∫l Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) opened the second  meeting of AGBM-6 by stating that this meeting is not  intended for negotiating but for refining and consolidating  similar proposals contained in the Framework Compilation of  Proposals (FCCC/AGBM/1997/2 and Add.1) to set out clear  alternatives for negotiation at AGBM-7.

Annex I Expert Group Chair Ian Pickard (UK) reported on  studies, carried out in cooperation with OECD and IEA, on  carbon and energy taxation, P&Ms to encourage innovation in  transport and technology and international greenhouse gas  emissions trading. FCCC/AGBM/1997/MISC.2 contains an  executive summary of these studies.

The Chair called on AGBM to consider the submissions on  general commitments and guiding objectives for P&Ms. SAMOA  called for a coordination mechanism to assist Annex I  Parties in implementing their commitments, as proposed in  the AOSIS protocol. The mechanism would provide advice on a  full range of measures including taxes and subsidies and  would report regularly to the 'Meeting of the Parties.' The  mechanism would be multi-disciplinary and open to  participation by all Parties, government representatives,  NGOs and scientists with relevant expertise. SAMOA also  noted the need to avoid duplication of tasks, but expressed  concern that existing subsidiary bodies may not be  appropriately equipped to address technical issues.

SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA said the comments from Parties  contained in document FCCC/AGBM/1997/2/Add.1 should be  included in the Framework Compilation. CHINA also expressed  confusion regarding references to Annexes X, A and B in the  proposals and urged Parties to refrain from developing new  categories. JAPAN suggested that Annex I Parties adopt P&Ms  according to national circumstances, in the areas of  efficient use of energy, low-carbon energy, technological  development and cooperation, and enhancement of sinks. The  'Meeting of the Parties' shall decide on indicators for  P&Ms.

The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, favored legally binding  P&Ms and highlighted his proposed Annexes A (common P&Ms), B  (coordinated P&Ms that receive high priority) and C  (priority P&Ms for inclusion in national programmes). The  proposal contains P&Ms on: renewable energies; energy  efficiency standards; labelling and other product-related  measures; transport sector; economic instruments; energy  policies; industry sector emissions; agriculture sector;  forestry; and fluorocarbons.

 Several delegations commented on the EU proposal and some  noted alternative approaches and priorities. POLAND and the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION supported a menu approach, which takes  account of various economic structures and attempts to  maintain a high and stable rate of economic growth. The G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, stressed that P&Ms  should not have adverse impacts on developing country  Parties. He also expressed concern about new annexes that  would impose new commitments on non-Annex I Parties. The EU  reiterated that his proposal provides flexibility through  Annex B, which lists P&Ms to be applied according to  national circumstances.

The US and SAUDI ARABIA did not support inclusion of  specific P&Ms. The US also noted that sound information is  not available for controlling greenhouse gases not listed in  the proposed Annex C and suggested elaborating on P&Ms under  the section on reporting. SAUDI ARABIA also warned that P&Ms  undertaken by Annex I countries could negatively affect  trade with developing countries. IRAN stressed the need for  a section on general commitments and guiding measures in the  protocol.

The EU clarified that energy efficiency, standards and  labeling, as well as P&Ms related to fluorocarbons, should  be the highest priority. He also noted that paragraphs  proposed by a number of Parties including Norway, Iceland,  New Zealand and Switzerland could be integrated into the EU  proposal. He said some developed countries, particularly the  US, have not included binding measures in their proposals  and emphasized the EU's conviction that P&Ms should be  included to fully encompass the Berlin Mandate and Geneva  Declaration.

CHINA reiterated that the Berlin Mandate requires an  elaboration of P&Ms whose objectives should be clear at this  stage. He said the EU proposal is too complicated and  supported a proposal by the Chair to use three 'groups'  rather than annexes on objectives, common but coordinated  P&Ms and national P&Ms. The US also cautioned against  including too many details and cited a number of examples  illustrating the difficulties of proposed P&Ms related to  specific products.

The EU did not support the groupings proposed by the Chair  and noted they were difficult to distinguish. He said  objectives should not be separated from mechanisms and  measures, and proposed listing all of them in Annex A. He  also said that relevant details related to specific products  must be considered because they are traded in the  international market and an international agreement is  needed to ensure results.

The EU also reported that the EU Council had reached a  common position on QELROS. The EU proposed that Parties to  the Berlin Mandate will reduce emission levels for CO2, CH4  and N2O by 15% by 2010 with a reference year of 1990. The EU  also proposed an interim target for 2005.

The Chair also requested delegates to consider a proposal  regarding countries with economies in transition that   requests a specific annex because of their particular  circumstances. The EU did not support a separate annex and  noted that the concerns of these countries could be  addressed elsewhere, such as in an introductory section. The  Chair, supported by IRAN, said these concerns are better  addressed when considering QELROs.

# ROUNDTABLE ON DIFFERENTIATION

Chair Chow Kok Kee (Malaysia) welcomed the speakers on  differentiation and called for a non-confrontational process  that promotes understanding rather than political positions.  Mr. Harald Dovland (Norway) said that differentiation  provides for a more equitable and ambitious goal than the  lowest common denominator agreement allowed by a flat-rate  approach. He highlighted single and multiple criteria  approaches to differentiation and emphasized that  differentiation formulas are not necessarily meant to  determine binding targets, but to provide tools for guiding  negotiations. He cited the EU's proposed goals as an  ambitious example for differentiation and cautioned that  flexible instruments, such as joint implementation, are not  a replacement for differentiation.

The US did not support the suggestion that progress can be  achieved through differentiation and said that under a flat  rate countries could accomplish more. He questioned the  'trade off' between differentiation and a flat rate and  asked if a system of differentiation is necessary. The Chair  then introduced other panelists, who spoke in their  individual capacity.

Mr. Akihiko Furuya (Japan) said that differentiation is  indispensable for achieving fairness and noted that the  Berlin Mandate calls for taking into account the different  starting points of countries. He discussed a 'formula-based  approach,' under which QELROs can be divided according to  specific indicators. He also noted the 'selective approach,'  under which countries could use GDP as an indicator, and the  'negotiation approach,' under which each country would  negotiate its QELROs with other countries.

Mr. Maciej Sadowski (Poland) said that the preferred  approach involves differentiation by countries and noted  that aggregation into groups could be effective. He  underscored the political difficulties in agreeing on a  common set of criteria and proposed concentrating on the  target to be achieved by each Party.

Amb. Louet (France) noted that differentiation is not a  result of theoretical considerations, but of unavoidable  practical necessity. He noted that the EU has adopted a  common position and explained that a greenhouse gas emission  reduction of 30% for Luxembourg and 25% for Germany, could  be offset by Portugal's and Greece's respective greenhouse  gas emission increase of 30% and 40%, which account for  differences in starting points. He noted that even countries  favoring the flat-rate concept recognize the need for  flexibility. He cautioned that a tradable permit system  would give premium to the biggest producer of greenhouse  gases.

 The EU underlined the differences in countries' ability and  costs associated with meeting commitments. As a regional  group, it is taking on joint commitments and will engage in  internal burdensharing. A number of EU countries are willing  to commit themselves to reduce emissions. SWITZERLAND  stressed that there is no good unique indicator that can  take into account national circumstances and said that the  logical starting point of the discussion is agreement on the  quantity to differentiate.

The US suggested focusing on targets, outcomes and QELROS so  that overall reductions can take place while Parties who  find targets burdensome can trade emissions with others.  GERMANY urged countries to enrich progress by making  concrete proposals regarding numbers for significant overall  reductions and the contributions that countries intend to  make toward these goals.

Amb. Howard Bamsey (Australia) stressed that differentiation  is necessary for reflecting different national  circumstances. He noted there are a large number of  proposals, but a small number of indicators. He outlined  common groups among proposed indicators: those based on  economic structures and resource bases; those based on  emission reduction tasks including population growth,  economic growth and per capita resources; and others based  on trade impacts.

GERMANY stated that differentiation within the EU was not  based on indicators, because indicators do not reflect  political reality. She noted that Germany, Denmark and  Austria accepted the largest shares of the reduction burden  because they are convinced that combating climate change is  important. The US noted that the EU collectively argued in  1990 that they would reduce emissions drastically. He said  this reduction would have been possible with a flat-rate.

GERMANY, referring to the EU experience, suggested making a  joint commitment for a future protocol, setting common  targets for Annex I Parties and deciding how to share them.  AUSTRALIA asked how differentiation was achieved within the  EU and noted this could set an example for Annex I countries  on the road to Kyoto. ICELAND stressed the need to reach  conclusions on differentiation before Kyoto.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Several participants provided favorable reviews of the non- group's efforts to fulfill its non-mandate of streamlining  the Framework Compilation. One participant reported that the  non-group narrowed the options and will submit a revised  text to AGBM. Another commented that some delegates appeared  unclear on the concept of streamlining and used the meeting  as an opportunity to regurgitate lengthy, all too familiar  positions.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### AGBM

Plenary will convene at 10:00 am in the Plenary I Hall  to consider QELROS.
