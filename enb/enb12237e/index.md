# CONTACT GROUPS

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group was  chaired by Sok Appadu (Mauritius), who invited Parties to consider  draft text on submissions of second non-Annex I national  communications. The US proposed text on operational procedures,  stating that greenhouse gas inventories should be submitted  voluntarily on a more frequent basis. BRAZIL, for the G-77/China,  opposed reference to greenhouse gas inventories and raised concern  over the frequency of reporting due to lack of technical and  financial capacity in developing countries. AUSTRALIA, supported  by CANADA and the EU, said frequent submissions of inventories  could help ensure improved quality of national communications. The  EU said the new GEF streamlined procedures for funding would help  the preparation and submission of national communications. Chair  Appadu requested Parties to submit further views in writing.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Delegates discussed the draft conclusions  proposed by Chair Dechen Tsering, and agreed on text noting the  documents on capacity building prepared by the Secretariat.  TANZANIA, for the G-77/China, ROMANIA, for EITs, and the US,  opposed by the EU and JAPAN, said the information contained in the  documents was incomplete and further work was needed on the  comprehensive review. AUSTRALIA, supported by NEW ZEALAND,  welcomed a substantive discussion to identify gaps in the review.  The meeting moved into informal discussions.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

Parties continued deliberations  on the draft COP decision. Delegates discussed alternative textual  proposals on whether, how or when to consider the outcomes of the  workshop on the status of modeling activities and action on these  outcomes. SAUDI ARABIA supported discussing modeling in the  context of economic diversification. Parties then discussed  options for text on impacts of response measures, and text on  addressing and promoting economic diversification. Delegates also  debated the inclusion of headings and sub-headings in the draft  decision. Delegates were unable to reach consensus on the  preambular text. A new negotiating text will be drafted, based on  submissions by the G-77/CHINA, US, EU, AOSIS and others.

# SBSTA IN-SESSION WORKSHOP

### SESSION 1: THE RELATIONSHIP OF CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION WITH  OTHER POLICY AND DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES

Ajay Mathur,  SenergyGlobal, India, presented on energy sector development and  climate mitigation in developing countries, noting the current  potential to introduce efficient technologies, as infrastructure  is built for the future. He urged distinguishing between  household, and economic and industrial energy use. He called for  addressing how international cooperation could reduce risks  associated with technology dissemination, and create demand for  energy efficiency and lowered energy intensity.

Sara Scherr, Forest Trends, US, spoke on LULUCF as a tool for  sustainable rural development, calling for climate change to be  integrated into the Millennium Development Goals. Noting the  wealth of knowledge on pro-poor initiatives and on-going schemes  for ensuring rigorous forest carbon projects, she called for  increasing the scope for CDM LULUCF activities and engaging rural  development community organizations in the negotiations.

Yang Hongwei, China Energy Research Institute, presented on energy  development in China, saying that socioeconomic development,  driven mainly by industrial development, is China's highest  priority. He stressed China's low per-capita energy consumption,  and noted substantive progress in optimizing energy mix and  improving energy efficiency.

Christobal Burgos, Directorate General for Energy and Transport,  European Commission, spoke on the EU's activities aimed at  mitigating emissions. Noting that Europe's dependence on external  energy sources is forecast to rise from 50% to 70% by 2030, he  highlighted policies for, inter alia: doubling the share of  renewable energy by 2010; establishing a clear legal framework;  enforcing more efficient performance; diversifying the energy  base; and stimulating research and investment. He emphasized the  EU's role in improving global energy cooperation, and noted its  commitment to developing the largest internal market in cleaner  energy as an incentive to promoting investment.

Bob MacGregor, Agriculture and Agri-Food, Canada, presented on  climate change mitigation policy for agriculture and efforts for  horizontal policy integration in Canada. He noted agriculture's  role in meeting Protocol goals and, emphasizing mitigation as an  integrated part of sustainable development, said Canada is  capitalizing on sink enhancement management practices.

In the discussion, FRANCE enquired about transport development in  China and India. Mathur said that while transport-related  emissions will increase, new mobility technologies are being  transferred to developing countries and the shift from public to  private transport is being addressed. CANADA asked about key  barriers to integrating climate change into development. Panelists  noted the low priority of rural development, information gaps and  insufficient pilot projects. Responding to a question by GERMANY  on incentives for renewable energy, Mathur emphasized technology  adaptation to user needs. Regarding AUSTRIA's question on viable  options for providing electricity to rural areas, Mathur noted  solar roof systems, and Hongwei pointed to mini-hydropower  generation.

### SESSION 2: CASE STUDIES OF MITIGATION

Stephen Karakezi, African  Energy Policy Research Network, Kenya, presented on renewable  energy initiatives in Africa as case studies of mitigation. He  noted renewed global interest in renewables in Africa due to the  oil crises and high unemployment rates. He urged policymakers to  consider geothermal and co-generation as viable climate policy  options.

Marco Antonio Rondon, International Center for Tropical  Agriculture, Colombia, outlined greenhouse gas mitigating  opportunities in Latin America through managing agriculture and  livestock in savannas, restoring degraded lands in the Amazon and  greening sugar cane harvest. He said introducing pastures into  savannas results in their conversion from a net source to a net  sink. He noted the adverse effects on biodiversity and local and  global geochemical cycles of such practices. He said other  opportunities for mitigating greenhouse gases include improving  cattle diet, expanding no-tillage agriculture and improving water  management in rice fields.

Igor Bashmakov, Center for Energy Efficiency, Russian Federation,  addressed implications of Protocol commitments for the energy  sector in Russia. He stressed that doubling GDP growth as planned  will require aggressive energy policies resulting in improved  energy efficiency, and highlighted district heating systems as an  area with potential for improvement. He said ratifying the  Protocol would pull the Russian Federation out of energy  inefficiency and provide opportunities to develop new energy  resources.

Sirintornthep Towprayoon, King Mongkut's University of Technology,  Thailand, spoke on greenhouse gas mitigation options from rice  fields. She described experiments that tested different  cultivation options, including water management and fertilizer  treatments. She noted that findings illustrate complex  relationships between management, global warming potential, and  market prices. She concluded that rice cultivation is a potential  mitigation option, but requires careful implementation and  consideration of socioeconomic impacts.

### SESSION 3: CLIMATE MITIGATION AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES

Edward Rubins,  Carnegie Mellon University, US, spoke on technology innovation for  climate mitigation and its relation to government policies. He  noted that policies should support a combination of options and  approaches, and highlighted the importance of government support  for education and training. He said policies should not be  affected by short-term political pressures, and emphasized the  importance of environmental policy for technology innovation.

    Bettina Hedden-Dunkhorst, Center for Development Research,  University of Bonn, Germany, presented on the potential of climate  change mitigation through technology innovations in agriculture.  She called for: policies that address rural poverty reduction  through payment of environmental services and market  opportunities; legal instruments for property rights; information  and education through media support; policy coordination and  sectoral linkages through participation in policy design and  decentralization; and targeted funding.

Teodoro Sanchez-Campos, Intermediate Technology Development Group  (ITDG), Peru, presented on promoting renewable energies in  isolated rural areas in Peru. He explained that small-scale energy  sources such as hydrological, solar photovoltaic and wind can  contribute to livelihoods of isolated and vulnerable communities.  He noted that barriers to clean energy include lack of affordable  technology, financial mechanisms, capacity, and legal frameworks.  He said that use of local human resources reduces project  operational and maintenance costs by one fifth. He highlighted  that direct intervention of local people in management and  operation increases sustainability, and said projects contribute  to local capacity building. He underscored the role of government  in promoting alternative energy technology and urged policymakers  to consider simplified and flexible rules for small-scale CDM.

Takashi Tomita, Sharp Corporation, Japan, spoke on the contribution  of photovoltaic systems to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.  He emphasized the importance of, inter alia, cooperation, research  and development, subsidies, feed-in tariffs, and training of  researchers to promote photovoltaic systems. He estimated that by  2030, the annual electricity production generated by photovoltaic  systems will amount to 300 GW. He noted the possibility to use  photovoltaic technology for electricity in homes and irrigation.

Gerald Rys, New Zealand Ministry of Forestry and Agriculture,  presented on non-carbon dioxide mitigation for pastoral  agriculture in New Zealand. He noted several measures to reduce  emissions of methane and nitrous oxide from sheep and cattle, such  as breeding, improved nutrition, vaccination and avoidance of  anaerobic soil conditions. He concluded that a package of measures  will be required, stressed the need to consider all greenhouse  gases, and emphasized the relationship between sustainable  agriculture and mitigation.

In the discussion, AUSTRIA expressed concern that policies fall  short of providing effective incentives. Rubins explained that  effective incentives depend on how policy design and regulation  create opportunities. The US asked Sanchez-Campos how ITDG  mobilizes stakeholders. Sanchez-Campos said communities are  enthusiastic if they are involved from the start, while engaging  governments is more challenging. FRANCE stated that effective  market transformation is driven by retailers and manufacturers.  Rubins highlighted the role of efficiency standards in this  regard. DENMARK stressed the social dimension of technology  application and highlighted the importance of cooperation among  project partners. On the time-frame for market incentives and  government intervention, FRANCE noted that progress in  technological innovations is evident before regulation. In  response, Rubins commented on the value of extension services.  JAPAN identified oil shocks and other economic and social  conditions as incentives for technology innovation.

### CONCLUSIONS

Chair Benrageb closed the session, and noted that an  oral report will be presented to SBSTA on Monday, 21 June.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The first week of SB-20 saw several signs of repetition in the  negotiations while waiting for the Protocol's entry into force.  In one case, delegates chose to simply refer back to previous  well-known positions, rather than repeat their views in the  contact group. In another, participants narrowly avoided  re-negotiating a paragraph taken from the UNFCCC, before its  origin was pointed out. While participants commented on the need  to deal with issues 'stuck in Neverland,' some observers called  for creativity to reinvigorate the process.
