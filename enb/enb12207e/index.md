# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

COP-8 President Baalu opened the high-level segment.

### STATEMENTS FROM HEADS OF UNITED NATIONS AGENCIES

The World  Meteorological Organization Secretary General G. O. P. Obasi  called on Parties to continue supporting the systematic  observation of the atmosphere and other activities to reduce  scientific uncertainties. UNEP Executive Director Klaus Töpfer  noted that those in poverty will suffer most from the adverse  effects of climate change. He called for concrete action on  adaptation as well as mitigation.

### STATEMENTS FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS

IPCC Chair  Rajendra Pachauri encouraged Parties to make maximum use of the  IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) in their deliberations, and  noted that the Fourth Assessment Report would focus more on the  costs and benefits of mitigation options and hopefully include  regional analyses. He also said that the IPCC would be  intensifying its outreach programme. GEF Assistant CEO Kenneth  King remarked on the third replenishment, which will allow the  GEF to increase funding for climate change related activities,  and noted that the GEF will make initial disbursements under the  UNFCCC LDC Fund in the coming weeks. World Bank Environment  Department Director Kristalina Georgieva said that the Bank is  committed to supporting carbon finance. She noted growth in  renewable energy investments, which presently account for 64% of  the Bank's energy lending portfolio.

OPEC General Secretary Alvaro Calderón remarked that renewable  technologies are in their infancy and that technological  advances are making oil and gas 'cleaner fuels.' He also  reminded delegates of the need to minimize the adverse effects  of policies and measures to address climate change and said that  adequate provision should be made for the transfer of technology  to developing countries. Asian-African Legal Consultative  Organization Secretary General Wafik Kamil stressed that the  principle of common but differentiated responsibility should  remain as the basis for the UNFCCC process. Highlighting various  projects, Asian Development Bank Deputy Director General Rolf  Zelius said that the Bank has provided assistance to developing  countries for least-cost adaptation and capacity-building.

### STATEMENTS FROM NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS

Nasimul Haque,  for the CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK, called for substantial financial  transfers from developed countries to developing countries to  support adaptation, and for measures to keep temperature change  well below 2 degrees Celsius, while ensuring development. He  also demanded the immediate ratification of the Protocol by  Australia, Canada, Russia, and the US. William Kyte, on behalf  of BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY NGOs, remarked on the role that  business must play in alleviating poverty through sustainable  development. He called for clear rules and procedures,  particularly relating to the CDM.

### PRESENTATION OF A CHILDREN'S CHARTER TO THE PRESIDENT

Two youth  delegates presented a Children's Charter to COP-8 President  Baalu. The Charter notes several concerns of India's youth,  including the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations, the  rise in sea levels, and the threat climate change poses to flora  and fauna. It calls for remedial action including increasing  energy efficiency and using renewable energy and public  transport.

### INAUGURATION OF THE HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

Prime Minister Atal  Bihari Vajpayee of India inaugurated the high-level segment with  the 'lighting of the lamp' ceremony. COP-8 President Baalu said  India is committed to addressing climate change and sustainable  development. He noted the participation of over 4000 delegates  from 169 counties at COP-8. He also expressed hope that the  Delhi Declaration would become a historic milestone in the  UNFCCC process.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter noted achievements  since COP-7, including the WSSD outcomes. Pointing to extreme  weather events experienced globally in recent months, she  highlighted the key role of tackling poverty and climate change.  Emphasizing the importance of implementation, she supported  practical approaches, including: action on adaptation and  vulnerability; the development of national communications; and  use of the CDM.

UN Under-Secretary General for Economic and Social Affairs Nitin  Desai delivered a message on behalf of UN Secretary General Kofi  Annan. He said that one challenge for the COP was to consider to  what extent the approaches, goals and methods agreed at WSSD can  be a basis for cooperation in this forum. In conclusion, he  called for a greater sense of shared global responsibility.

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India described India's  commitment to combating global climate change, remarking on its  renewable energy sector and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.  He highlighted the importance of adaptation, vulnerability, and  capacity-building for developing counties, and said that  consideration of developing country commitments would be  premature due to, among other things, inequitable per-capita  emissions rights, and differences in per-capita income between  developing and developed countries.

# ROUND TABLE

COP President Baalu welcomed delegates to the first Ministerial  Round Table under the theme 'Taking Stock,' co-chaired by  Minister Margaret Beckett (UK). Co-Chair Beckett said the  session would set the stage for later round tables. While noting  the comprehensive climate change mitigation framework already  achieved, she said there is no room for complacency.

Many delegates highlighted their domestic circumstances, actions  and experiences. TONGA, for AOSIS, noted that small island  developing states are among those hardest hit by climate change.  NIUE said its vulnerability is related to capacity limitations.  PANAMA noted that his country's biodiversity is being effected  by climate change, while BHUTAN underscored the vulnerability of  its fragile mountain ecosystem. FINLAND stressed the EU's  efforts to achieve tangible results and show demonstrable  progress by 2005.

On meeting the UNFCCC's ultimate objective of stabilizing  greenhouse gases at a level preventing dangerous anthropogenic  interference with the climate system, NEW ZEALAND said progress  was not nearly enough. The EU called for a common dialogue,  including identifying a level of non-dangerous emissions  concentrations. AOSIS stressed an immediate reduction in  emissions of 50-80%. The CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK urged the COP to  begin discussions on establishing limits to prevent dangerous  climate change. IRELAND proposed discussion on a fair and  equitable distribution of emission targets.

On future action, NEW ZEALAND called for a broad approach across  countries. AOSIS and JAPAN said all countries will need to be  involved in mitigation. Recognising that countries will carry  different burdens with regard to mitigation, SWITZERLAND  stressed cooperation and partnerships. NORWAY called for an  ambitious and long-term global climate change regime and  stressed the need for a political response to the IPCC TAR.  POLAND said adaptation and funding for climate change must go  hand-in-hand with mitigation and long-term strategies.

AOSIS, MEXICO, and UGANDA noted that Annex I countries are not  fulfilling commitments and emissions are on the rise.  Considering this, MALAYSIA questioned how some Annex I countries  can propose developing country emission reduction commitments.  THAILAND, VENEZUELA, TANZANIA and SAUDI ARABIA opposed  discussion of reduction commitments for developing countries.  The EU underscored the need for dialogue on the matter.

AOSIS, PANAMA and SAMOA called for strengthening adaptation.  UGANDA, IRAN and MALAYSIA urged further efforts with regard to  transfer of technology, financial resources and capacity- building. NEPAL underscored the importance of capacity-building  and further research to mitigate the effects of climate change.  BRAZIL urged concrete measures and adequate technologies.

ETHIOPIA said economic development is crucial for adapting to  climate change, and urged increased financial support. MEXICO  called for resources for adaptation.

IRAN stressed minimizing losses due to adverse effects and  impacts of response measures on developing countries with  economies dependent on fossil fuels. SAUDI ARABIA expressed  concern regarding the limited progress on UNFCCC Article 4.8 and  4.9 (adverse effects).

FINLAND and DENMARK pledged support to the LDC Fund. KENYA and  UGANDA appealed for a special fund for developing countries  other than LDCs.

On the CDM, COLOMBIA supported sequestration projects. MEXICO  said the complex rules are difficult to apply, and the  INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES  supported simplified procedures. URUGUAY said the lack of  institutional and legal capacity was a barrier to CDM  implementation.

On ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA  announced its ratification. NEW ZEALAND said his country will  'almost certainly' ratify the Protocol next month. JAPAN,  BULGARIA, ETHIOPIA, KENYA, the EU and BRAZIL urged countries to  ratify the Protocol. CHINA said developed countries are 'duty  bound' to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and expressed  disappointment that the Protocol has not yet entered into force.

On the Delhi Declaration, JAPAN supported including the need to  address reductions beyond the first commitment period. UGANDA  said the Declaration should call for the ratification of the  Protocol. SWITZERLAND supported reference to a forward-looking  approach to address the UNFCCC's ultimate objective. AUSTRALIA  said it should put into place a process for future global  emission reduction arrangements. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA supported  a Declaration that would consider the human dimension to climate  change.

Co-Chair Beckett summarized the session's key themes and closed  the session.

# CONTACT GROUP

### NON-ANNEX I ISSUES

The contact group, chaired by José Romero  (Switzerland), met throughout the day. Parties worked through  the text on the improved guidelines for non-Annex I national  communications, removing several brackets. The discussion  focused on how best to structure individual paragraphs so that  they accurately reflect agreed ideas. In several instances,  delegates raised the issue of when to use 'should' rather than  'are encouraged to.' In the afternoon session, Parties returned  to the beginning of the text in an effort to remove remaining  brackets. Parties could not agree on whether the guidelines  should refer to specific paragraphs of UNFCCC Articles 4  (commitments) and 12 (communication of information), the  Articles in their entirety, or have no reference to specific  articles.

Views on the use of elements from the guidelines for Annex I  national communications varied, and no agreement was reached on  inventory years, or whether Parties 'should' or 'shall' use the  IPCC Revised 1996 Guidelines for the preparation of inventories.  Delegates again addressed, and failed to agree, whether to have  'develop and use' or just 'use' country-specific and regional  emissions factors. They then discussed, among other options,  whether to have 'provide information on' or 'consider  identifying' key source categories as described in the IPCC Good  Practice Guidance, and failed to agree. Discussions continued  late into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates were nowhere to be seen late Wednesday night with the  arrival of the Ministers and protracted discussions on  guidelines for non-Annex I communications taking place. Some  participants noted slow but steady progress, while others  shuddered at the possibility of this issue taking the COP into  an additional day of negotiations. On a related issue, a number  of observers were quick to note an interesting shift on the  issue of future developing country commitments with some  Ministers addressing the issue with a frankness not displayed by  all negotiators a week ago.
