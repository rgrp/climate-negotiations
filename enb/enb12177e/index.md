abstract: "The eighteenth session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC-18) was held from 24-29 September 2001, in London,  UK. Approximately 280 delegates, experts and representatives of  international and non-governmental organizations attended the  session."
---

The session focused on approving/adopting the Synthesis Report of  the IPCC's Third Assessment Report (TAR). The Synthesis Report,  which consists of a summary for policy-makers (SPM) and an  underlying longer part, integrates the information contained  within the TAR and draws on all previously approved and accepted  IPCC reports to address nine policy-relevant questions identified  by the IPCC, based on submissions by governments. It is the first  such report prepared by the IPCC.

Participants met in Plenary throughout the six-day session,  convening contact groups to address contentious issues. Throughout  the week, they approved the SPM using a line-by-line approach and  adopted the underlying longer part paragraph-by-paragraph during  the final two days. The approval/adoption of the Synthesis Report  was completed on Saturday, 29 September. In addition, delegates  took a number of management decisions, including to:retain the current three working groups, maintain the Task  Force on Inventories, and keep the size of the IPCC Bureau at 30  members; adopt the IPCC work programme and budget for 2002-2004; endorse a scoping paper for the Technical Paper on Climate  Change and Biological Diversity and endorse in principle the  preparation of a technical paper on climate change and sustainable  development; accept a work programme on Good Practice Guidance on Land  Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry and authorize further work on  developing definitions for degradation and devegetation; and authorize the preparation of scoping papers for any work  requested by the 7th Conference of the Parties (COP-7) to the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

The finalization of the Synthesis Report completed nearly five  years of work on the TAR. The issue of how governments will  respond to the Synthesis Report and make use of its answers to  policy-relevant questions remains to be seen. Their first  opportunity to respond will be COP-7, where an in-depth debate on  the TAR is scheduled to take place.

The next session of the IPCC will take place in April 2002, at a  venue to be determined.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was established in  1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United  Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The purpose of the IPCC is  to assess the scientific, technical and socioeconomic information  relevant to understanding the risks associated with human-induced  climate change. The IPCC does not undertake new research, nor does  it monitor climate-related data, but bases its assessments on  published and peer reviewed scientific and technical literature.  Its Secretariat is located in Geneva and is staffed by both WMO  and UNEP.

Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of  comprehensive assessments, special reports and technical papers,  providing scientific information on climate change to the  international community, including policy-makers and the general  public. This information has played an important role in the  negotiations under the UNFCCC. The UNFCCC, which provides the  overall policy framework for addressing climate change, was  adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1994.

The current structure of the IPCC includes three working groups  and a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories:Working Group I addresses the scientific aspects of the  climate system and climate change.

Working Group II addresses the scientific, technical,  environmental, economic and social aspects of the vulnerability  (sensitivity and adaptability) to climate change, and the negative  and positive consequences (impacts) for ecological systems,  socioeconomic sectors and human health, with an emphasis on  regional sectoral and cross-sectoral issues.

Working Group III assesses the scientific, technical,  environmental, economic and social aspects of the mitigation of  climate change, as well as the methodological aspects of cross- cutting issues.

The current Bureau of the IPCC was established in 1997. It has 30  members representing all six WMO regions (Africa, Asia, South  America, North and Central America, South-West Pacific, Europe).

### KEY IPCC REPORTS

The IPCC completed its first comprehensive  assessment of climate change compiled in the First Assessment  Report (FAR) in 1990 and the Second Assessment Report (SAR) in  1995. In 1994 it prepared technical guidelines for assessing  greenhouse gas inventories and subsequently revised these in 1996.  The Kyoto Protocol in 1997 reaffirmed the use of the Revised IPCC  Guidelines for preparing national greenhouse gas inventories by  Parties to the UNFCCC and, in the future, by Parties to the  Protocol.

The IPCC also prepares special reports and technical papers on  topics where independent scientific information and advice is  deemed necessary. It prepared, for example, a Special Report on  Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) in 2000, at the  request of the UNFCCC.

### THIRD ASSESSMENT REPORT

The TAR addresses policy-relevant  scientific, technical, and socioeconomic dimensions of climate  change. It concentrates on findings since 1995 and pays attention  to both regional and global scales, including non-English  literature to the extent possible. The preparation of the TAR was  guided by a decision paper adopted by the Panel in 1997 at its  thirteenth session. The preparation of the TAR was also guided by  papers on cross-cutting issues, such as equity, uncertainties and  costing methodologies, published as IPCC supporting material to  ensure a coordinated approach to these issues within all working  groups.

The TAR is composed of a comprehensive assessment from the three  IPCC working groups, an SPM and technical summary of each working  group report, and a Synthesis Report. The comprehensive  assessments, Synthesis Report and SPMs have been subject to  extensive peer review from experts and governments. The Synthesis  Report is written in a non-technical style aimed at policy-makers  and is composed of an underlying longer part and an SPM. It  addresses nine policy-relevant questions identified by the IPCC  based on submissions by governments.

Working Group I Contribution to the TAR: Working Group I met from  17-20 January 2001, in Shanghai, China, to finalize and adopt its  part of the TAR. One hundred and fifty delegates from 100  countries adopted the report, 'Climate Change 2001: The Scientific  Basis,' as well as the summary for policy-makers. The report,  which is based on work by 123 authors and more than 500  contributors, assesses the current state of understanding of the  climate system and provides estimates of its projected future  evolution. It notes that 'an increasing body of observation gives  a collective picture of a warming world' and that the climate is  changing more rapidly than predicted in the SAR.

Working Group II Contribution to the TAR: Working Group II met  from 13-16 February 2001, in Geneva, Switzerland, to finalize and  adopt its part of the TAR. More than 160 delegates from 100  countries approved the report, 'Climate Change 2001: Impacts,  Adaptation and Vulnerability,' as well as the summary for policy- makers. The full report was completed by more than 400 authors and  contributors, assessing scientific literature related to the  impacts of, and vulnerability to, climate change. The report  suggests projected climate changes over the next century could  potentially lead to future large-scale and possibly irreversible  changes. Focusing on a variety of issues, the report considers the  effects of climate change on water resources, terrestrial  ecosystems and human health. It also addresses regional concerns,  vulnerabilities and adaptive capacities.

Working Group III Contribution to the TAR: Working Group III met  in Accra, Ghana, from 28 February - 3 March 2001, to finalize and  adopt its part of the TAR. More than 140 delegates from 85  countries approved the report, 'Climate Change 2001: Mitigation,'  as well as the summary for policy-makers. The report was prepared  by nearly 400 authors and contributors. It assesses options for  cutting greenhouse gas emissions by reviewing: technologies  available for controlling emissions; steps that can be taken in  the industry and energy sectors to promote a transition to a  cleaner energy future; contributions through carbon sequestration  by forestry and agriculture; policies for achieving cost-effective  and 'no-regrets' emissions reductions; and ways to overcome  political, cultural and institutional barriers to mitigation.

### SEVENTEENTH SESSION OF THE IPCC

At IPCC-17, held from 4-6 April  2001, at UNEP Headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, participants  accepted the actions of the three IPCC Working Groups with regard  to adopting the three sections of the TAR. They considered  progress on the Synthesis Report, and discussed in depth the  future of the IPCC. Participants also approved the preparation of  a technical paper on the links between biological diversity and  climate change, and considered a proposal for a special report on  climate change and sustainable development.

# REPORT OF THE MEETING

IPCC Chair Robert Watson opened the eighteenth session of the  Panel (IPCC-18) on Monday morning, 24 September. Delegates  observed a minute of silence as a mark of respect for the victims  of the recent terrorist attacks in the US.

UK Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott welcomed all participants  to the UK. Paying tribute to the IPCC, he stated that the Panel's  hard work and analysis had helped to defeat the 'flat-earthers'  who denied the existence of human-induced climate change. He noted  that the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC had marked a  coming together of sound science and political will. He outlined  the UK climate change programme, which is expected to cut  greenhouse gas emissions by 23%, and emphasized the opportunities  for 'gain not pain' in climate policy through cost-effective  measures and better technology. He expressed hope that the 'Bonn  Agreements,' recently adopted at the resumed UNFCCC COP-6 held in  Bonn from 16-27 July 2001, would pave the way for the entry into  force of the Kyoto Protocol by 2002. In conclusion, he underscored  the important role played by the IPCC in advancing the political  process on climate change.

WMO Secretary-General G.O.P. Obasi thanked the UK government for  hosting the meeting. Noting that the TAR is eagerly awaited, he  commended the IPCC for its work, recalling the critical role that  the First and Second Assessment Reports had played in the  negotiations on the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol, respectively.  Referring to the IPCC's future work and structure, he stressed  that the Panel must be 'ruthlessly factual,' work by consensus,  and serve all governments. Finally, he emphasized the need for  strengthened climate observation and drew attention to the  Integrated Global Observing Strategy that is being developed by  WMO and its relevant partners.

UNEP Assistant Executive Director Jorge Illueca, speaking on  behalf of UNEP Executive Director Klaus Töpfer, congratulated all  those involved in the preparation of the TAR. He noted that  scientific consensus on climate change has grown stronger, and  that its impacts are already being felt around the world. He  highlighted UNEP's role in addressing climate change, notably in  the areas of adaptation, renewable energy and public awareness, as  well as its work on international environmental governance.

Dennis Tirpak, Coordinator for Methods, Science and Technology,  UNFCCC Secretariat, speaking on behalf of UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar, expressed his appreciation for  the fresh material and new insights contained in the TAR. He  underlined the importance of UNFCCC COP-7, noting that decisions  adopted at that session will close one chapter of the climate  change negotiations and start opening a new one. He stated that a  key question at UNFCCC COP-7 with regard to the TAR will be the  use of its information, and put forward several specific  operational, research and policy questions to be considered. In  conclusion, he remarked that time will be needed to adequately  reflect on the information presented in the TAR and to take  decisions on subsequent actions.

Chair Watson thanked delegates for their commitment to the IPCC  and remarked that the Panel is entering the final phase of its  work on the TAR. He stated that the issue now is not whether  climate change is happening, but how much, where and when. He said  that the IPCC has helped shape policy and that all those involved  in the Panel should be proud of their work in providing decision- makers with the best available evidence to formulate cost- effective and equitable climate change policies. He congratulated  governments on the constructive comments received on the draft  Synthesis Report and stated that he looked forward to an early  approval of the Report.

IPCC Secretary N. Sundararaman stressed the need for the IPCC to  uncompromisingly uphold its objectivity in order to remain useful.  He emphasized the importance of aggressively increasing the  involvement of experts from developing countries and countries  with economies in transition, given that climate change affects  different communities in different ways.

Chair Watson then introduced the programme of work of the session.  He stated that the main task for the Panel was to approve/adopt  the draft Synthesis Report of the TAR, including the SPM and the  underlying longer part. He noted that a number of 'management  decisions' were also on the agenda. Delegates agreed on the  organization of work for the session.

# APPROVAL/ADOPTION OF THE DRAFT SYNTHESIS REPORT

On Monday, 24 September, Chair Watson introduced the SPM of the  Synthesis Report and the underlying draft longer part. He reported  that approximately 50 lead authors, as well as review editors from  the Bureau, had considered comments submitted by governments, NGOs  and experts over the past week to prepare a revised draft of the  SPM for this meeting.

Noting that some comments had called for greater focus on  uncertainties and beneficial effects of climate change while  others had sought more emphasis on adverse impacts, Chair Watson  underscored the need for a balanced document.

Concerning the organization of work, Watson said that the Plenary  would first consider and approve the SPM line-by-line and that the  lead authors, working with the review editors, would then revise  the underlying longer part to ensure its full consistency with the  approved SPM. He stated that the revised underlying longer part  would then be considered and adopted paragraph-by-paragraph by the  Plenary to ensure consistency in tone, message and structure with  the SPM and all underlying documents on which it is based.

### APPROVAL OF THE SUMMARY FOR POLICY-MAKERS OF THE SYNTHESIS REPORT

Delegates considered the SPM of the Synthesis Report throughout  the week. Many editorial, technical and substantive changes were  proposed. Where appropriate, the lead authors responded to  proposed changes and clarified issues. Views often differed on how  the findings of the working groups should be synthesized,  interpreted and reflected, and on how to ensure consistency  between the working group and Synthesis Report SPMs. Opinions also  differed on the messages that should be conveyed to policy-makers.  Throughout the discussion, Chair Watson urged delegates not to  alter text taken directly from the approved working group SPMs and  to refrain from adding more detailed text. The approval of the SPM  was completed on Saturday, 29 September.

The report below highlights some of the key issues discussed on  each of the nine policy-relevant questions.

### Question 1:

This question addressed the contribution of  scientific, technical and socioeconomic analyses to the  determination of what constitutes dangerous anthropogenic  interference with the climate system, as referred to in UNFCCC  Article 2.

Views differed over whether and how to reflect uncertainty in  defining what constitutes 'dangerous anthropogenic interference  with the climate system.' Views also differed over whether to  refer to 'mitigative capacity' as one of the factors determining  what constitutes such 'dangerous anthropogenic interference.' Some  participants expressed concern over including this reference,  questioning its meaning and logic. Delegates acknowledged the  intellectual complexity of the issue but agreed to include the  reference.

Some participants expressed concern over lack of substance in the  answer to Question 1 and proposed to include a figure showing that  stabilization of CO2 concentrations would reduce the risks of  climate change damages. Others opposed this proposal. Chair Watson  recalled that Question 1 had been designed to provide a framework  for reflection on dangerous anthropogenic interference with the  climate system, and not to present specific information, since  doing so would result in a 'laundry list' of information and pre- empt the other questions. Delegates agreed not to include the  figure.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer states that natural,  technical and social sciences can provide essential information  and evidence needed for decision-making on what constitutes  'dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.' At  the same time, such decisions are value judgments determined  through socio-political processes, taking into account  considerations such as development, equity, and sustainability, as  well as uncertainties and risk. The answer also states that the  basis for determining what constitutes 'dangerous anthropogenic  interference' will vary among regions and depends upon mitigative  capacity, since the magnitude and the rate of change are both  important. It also notes that the TAR assesses available  information on the timing, opportunities, costs, benefits, and  impacts of various mitigation and adaptation options.

### Question 2:

This question addressed the evidence for, and causes  and consequences of, changes in the Earth's climate since the pre- industrial era.

Views differed over whether to include additional proposed text  highlighting differences between satellite and surface temperature  measurements. Chair Watson formed a contact group to consider the  issue. Delegates eventually agreed to the Chair's proposal to  include a sentence stating that temperature changes have not been  uniform globally, but have varied over regions and different parts  of the lower atmosphere.

Delegates also debated proposed amendments to the sentence 'there  is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed  over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.' Chair  Watson guarded against altering this 'take home message' from the  Working Group I SPM, and the sentence was approved without change.

Other issues debated by participants included the list of observed  changes to climate and biophysical systems in the 20th century.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer states that the Earth's  climate system has demonstrably changed on both global and  regional scales since the pre-industrial era, with some of these  changes attributable to human activities. It explains that,  globally, it is very likely that the 1990s was the warmest decade,  and 1998 the warmest year, in the instrumental record (1861-2000).  The answer notes that changes in sea level, snow cover, ice extent  and precipitation are consistent with warming near the Earth's  surface, providing examples and noting uncertainties. It states  that observed regional climate changes have already affected  hydrological systems and terrestrial and marine ecosystems, and  socioeconomic vulnerability to climate change appears to be  rising. A table provides examples of observed changes during the  20th century in the atmosphere, climate and biophysical system.

### Question 3:

This question addressed the regional and global  climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic consequences in the  next 25, 50 and 100 years associated with a range of greenhouse  gas emissions arising from scenarios used in the TAR.

Regarding human health, several delegates noted the existence of  positive effects of climate change on human health and the small  number of studies on vector-borne diseases.

Concerning crop yields, delegates debated whether reference to the  level of warming projected to increase food prices globally should  be quantified more precisely than 'a few degrees Celsius.' Several  non-Anglophone delegates noted problems in the translation of the  term 'a few.' Agreement was reached not to quantify the degree of  warming, but to spell out the English term 'a few' in the  translated documents.

On water resources, some delegates noted that factors other than  climate change contribute to water shortage in many water-scarce  areas of the world and proposed to spell out these factors. Others  expressed concern at shifting the focus away from climate change.  Agreement was reached to identify those additional factors  contributing to water shortage.

Concerning the severe social and economic effects faced in  particular by populations that inhabit small islands and/or low  lying coastal areas, several delegations proposed, and the Plenary  accepted, to reference additional areas of concern, such as the  loss of beaches, coastal erosion and storm surges. One participant  noted that the impacts of climate change are already being felt in  small island States.

Other issues debated by delegates included: the extent to which  adaptation can reduce the adverse effects of climate change; and  the estimated aggregated market sector effects measured as changes  in GDP of climate change on developing and developed countries.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer to this question states that  emission scenarios project the following characteristics for 2100:  CO2 concentrations of 540-970 ppm; an increase in globally  averaged surface temperature of 1.4-5.8°C; and an increase in sea  level of 0.09-0.88 m. The answer says that projected climate  change will have beneficial and adverse environmental and  socioeconomic effects, but the larger the changes and rate of  change in climate, the more the adverse effects predominate. It  explains in more detail projected climate change impacts on: human  health; ecological productivity and biodiversity; agriculture;  water; small islands and low-lying coasts; and changes in GDP. The  answer also discusses the potential for adaptation to reduce  adverse effects of climate change and to produce immediate  ancillary benefits, but not to prevent all damages. Several  figures are included to illustrate the answer, including:  socioeconomic, emissions and greenhouse gas concentration  scenarios; temperature and sea-level change; and changes in annual  run-off.

### Question 4:

This question addressed climate fluctuations, extreme  events and the risk of abrupt/non-linear changes.

Views differed over how to characterize the nature, degree and  likelihood of abrupt/non-linear changes in physical systems  resulting from climate change, and the extent to which these may  be irreversible. Given the varying terminology used in the  different working groups, delegates had difficulty merging  material from the SPMs of Working Groups I and II. A contact group  was formed to consider this issue.

On examples of projected abrupt/non-linear changes, participants  discussed the implication of local warming over Greenland on  global sea-level rise. Agreement was reached on a sentence stating  that 'ice sheet models project that a local warming of larger than  3°C, if sustained for millennia, would lead to virtually a  complete melting of the Greenland ice sheet with a resulting sea- level rise of about 7m.' Delegates also agreed to strengthen a  reference to the effects of permafrost melting to say that  landslides will affect water courses and wetland ecosystems, as  well as infrastructure.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer states that models project an  increase in daily, seasonal, inter-annual and decadal climate  variability, as well as changes in frequency, intensity, and  duration of extreme climate events. It also states that greenhouse  gas forcing in the 21st century could set in motion abrupt/non- linear changes in physical and biological systems over the coming  decades to millennia, with a wide range of associated likelihoods.  Further, the answer stipulates that some of the projected changes  in physical systems and in the natural sources and sinks of  greenhouse gases could be irreversible, but there is an incomplete  understanding of some of the underlying processes. Changes in  climate could increase the risk of such changes in many  ecosystems. A table gives examples of climate variability and  extreme climate events, and examples of their impacts.

### Question 5:

This question addressed inertia and time-scales  associated with changes in the climate system, ecological systems,  and socioeconomic sectors and their interactions.

On the inertia of the climate system, some participants noted the  need to consider greenhouse gases other than CO2, particularly  short-lived gases, and the text was amended to reflect this point.  In response to queries from two delegations, Chair Watson  confirmed as factual the statement that stabilization of CO2  emissions at near-current levels will never lead to stabilization  of CO2 atmospheric concentrations.

Concerning inertia in socioeconomic systems, participants debated  the costs of changing socioeconomic systems to address climate  change, and how such costs vary depending on the necessary speed  of response, the availability of technology and the depreciation  of capital stock. Some delegates stated that changes to  socioeconomic systems are possible at no net cost, even when  responding under pressure, but others disagreed. Delegates  approved a sentence noting that costs of change are higher when  socioeconomic systems must respond quickly, but lower when there  is time to respond.

On the policy implications of inertia, delegates discussed  differences in the implications of inertia for mitigation and  adaptation, and whether adaptation should be characterized as  involving mainly local/regional actions and mitigation as  involving coordinated global actions. Some delegations argued that  adaptation can be addressed at a global level, while mitigation  also involves local level action. Chair Watson formed a contact  group to seek a compromise solution. The group reached agreement  on a text, later approved by Plenary, which states that inertia  has different consequences for adaptation than for mitigation and  that adaptation is primarily oriented to address localized impacts  of climate change, while mitigation aims to address the impacts on  the climate system.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer to this question notes that  inertia is a widespread and inherent characteristic of the  interacting climate, ecological and socioeconomic systems, and  thus some impacts of climate change may be slow to become apparent  and could be irreversible if thresholds are crossed. The answer  explains the nature of inertia in climate systems, ecological  systems and socioeconomic systems, as well as its policy  implications. Among other findings, the answer reports that:  surface air temperature and sea levels will continue to rise after  stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations; inertia makes  adaptation inevitable and already necessary in some cases; and  anticipatory adaptation and mitigation actions are beneficial,  given inertia in the climate system and the possibility of  irreversibility. The answer includes a graph showing how CO2  concentrations, temperature and sea levels continue to rise long  after emissions are reduced.

### Question 6:

This question assesses the implications of stabilizing  concentrations of greenhouse gases at a range of levels for the  climate, ecological systems and socioeconomic sectors.

Concerning the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations,  delegates considered a proposal to make explicit reference to the  cost of greenhouse gas mitigation. They agreed to include a  sentence stating that mitigation actions to stabilize atmospheric  greenhouse gas concentrations at lower levels would generate  greater benefits in terms of less damage. Throughout debates on  Question 6, delegates considered whether or not continuous  reference should be made to the cost of mitigation action when  addressing its benefits. Chair Watson reminded delegates that  Question 7 deals with mitigation action costs, and stated that  continuous reference to cost in Question 6 would necessitate  similar reference to the benefits of mitigation actions in  Question 7. Participants agreed to keep the two questions  separate, with only minimal reference to other questions.

Delegates discussed whether reference should be made to the timing  of global emissions peaks for specific stabilization levels. Some  delegates stressed the importance of such a reference in conveying  a clear message to policy-makers, but others disagreed. A sentence  referring to two outer stabilization levels (450 ppm and 1000 ppm)  and the timings of their respective emission peaks was eventually  adopted.

In estimating global mean temperature increase at specified levels  of atmospheric CO2 concentration stabilization, delegates agreed  to refer to assumptions made about emissions of non-CO2 greenhouse  gases and aerosols. Further, delegates requested the lead authors  to calculate the contribution of non-greenhouse gases and aerosols  to equilibrium warming. Appropriate text on this matter was  adopted later in the week.

Delegations considered whether to keep or amend a statement noting  that all of the CO2 stabilization profiles analyzed would avoid  much of the upper end of the projected warming of 1.4-5.8°C by  2100. Chair Watson established a contact group to discuss this  issue. Further matters on which agreement could not be reached in  Plenary and which were referred to the contact group included: an  appropriate way of referencing the amount of estimated sea-level  rise for specified increases in CO2 concentration; reference to  non-CO2 greenhouse gases in contributing to sea-level rise; and  reference to the reduction of inequity through adaptation and  mitigation actions. After some debate, wording devised in the  contact group was agreed on for all issues.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer states that projected warming  and sea-level rise will be smaller, the greater the emissions  reductions and the earlier they are introduced. Sea level and ice  sheets would continue to respond to warming for many centuries  after greenhouse gas concentrations have been stabilized. A wide  band of uncertainty exists in the amount of warming that would  result from any stabilized greenhouse gas concentration. The  answer further notes that reducing emissions of greenhouse gases  to stabilize their atmospheric concentration would delay and  reduce damages caused by climate change, and that adaptation is a  necessary strategy at all scales to complement climate change  mitigation efforts.

### Question 7:

This question examines what is known about the  potential for, costs and benefits of, and time frame for, reducing  greenhouse gas emissions.

On forests, agricultural lands, and other terrestrial ecosystems  that offer significant carbon mitigation potential, several  delegations noted the importance of spelling out the strategies by  which biological mitigation can occur, namely: conservation of  existing carbon pools; sequestration by increasing the size of  carbon pools; and substitution of sustainably produced biological  products. Wording to this effect was adopted.

Delegates debated whether to include a footnote stating that, in  the hypothetical situation that all of the carbon released by  historical land-use changes could be restored to the terrestrial  biosphere over the course of a century, atmospheric CO2  concentrations could potentially be reduced by no more than 40 to  70 ppm. The matter was referred to a contact group and the  footnote was later approved with minor textual changes.

In response to queries from delegates over the cost estimates for  Kyoto Protocol Annex B (developed) countries to implement the  Kyoto Protocol, the lead authors confirmed that the figures  provided were up-to-date.

Views differed over how to reflect uncertainties in the  'spillover' effect of climate change mitigation policies  implemented by UNFCCC Annex I (developed) countries on non-Annex I  (developing) countries. One participant noted the need for balance  between the treatment of uncertainties in 'spillover' effects on  developing countries and in mitigation costs in Annex I countries.  Chair Watson formed a contact group to draft compromise text.

Views also differed over a statement averaging out the long-term  costs of mitigating climate change over 100 years. Some  participants claimed that a focus on long-term average costs is  misleading and downplays short-term transition costs. Others  argued that it places mitigation costs in context and demonstrates  the importance of gradual mitigation action. Chair Watson convened  a contact group to further discuss the issue.

Discussion also took place over the figures to be included to  illustrate the answer, and the message that these would send to  policy-makers. Several delegates expressed concern at a graph  illustrating the estimated costs from different economic models of  stabilizing CO2 concentrations at various levels, arguing that it  exaggerates costs and could imply that it is cheaper to delay  mitigation action. After consideration in a contact group,  delegates agreed to delete the figure from the SPM, but to retain  it in the underlying report. After some debate, delegates agreed  to include a graph illustrating projected global average GDP  reduction in 2050 due to climate change mitigation action  according to various scenarios, but to indicate in the figure  caption that the data does not take into account the benefits of  avoided climate change.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer to this question states that  there are many opportunities to reduce near-term emissions and  that technical progress in this regard has been faster than  anticipated, but barriers exist to the deployment of these  opportunities. The answer explains reasons behind the varying  mitigation cost estimates of different models and studies, and  notes substantial opportunities for lowering costs, for example,  through use of carbon sinks and emissions trading. The answer  discusses the well-established, albeit varied, 'spillover' effects  on non-Annex I countries of emission constraints on Annex I  countries. It explains how technology development and diffusion  are important components of cost-effective stabilization, and how  the pathway to meeting a particular stabilization target will have  an impact on mitigation cost.

### Question 8:

This question discusses the interactions between  climate change, other environmental issues and sustainable  development.

Concerning synergies and trade-offs in climate change response  options, delegates discussed various means of reducing greenhouse  gas emissions, including a proposal to refer to increasing the use  of advanced fossil fuel technologies, rather than the substitution  of fossil fuel combustion by renewable energy. Chair Watson  convened a contact group on the proposal. The contact group agreed  to refer to increasing the share of lower carbon emitting fossil  fuels, advanced fossil fuel technologies and renewable energy  technologies.

On linkages between multilateral environmental agreements,  participants discussed how to characterize the interaction between  multilateral agreements on ozone and climate change. Several  delegates proposed, and the Plenary agreed, to note potential  contradictions between the agreements, whereby substances that are  replacements for ozone-depleting substances are greenhouse gases.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer to this question notes that  local, regional and global environmental issues are inextricably  linked and affect sustainable development, and that synergistic  opportunities exist to develop more effective response options  that enhance benefits, reduce costs, and meet human needs more  sustainably. The answer explains how meeting human needs, in many  instances, causes environmental degradation, which in turn  threatens the ability to meet present and future needs. The answer  also discusses linkages between climate change and other  environmental issues, such as biodiversity loss, desertification  and stratospheric ozone depletion, pointing to synergies and  trade-offs.

### Question 9:

This question calls for a summary of the most robust  findings and uncertainties.

Delegates debated the definition of 'robust finding,' noting that  the term is used for the first time in the Synthesis Report, and  agreed some minor changes to it.

During discussions on a table listing the most robust findings and  associated key uncertainties, several delegates proposed to add  robust findings including: the existence of long lived gases; the  likelihood of more heat/cold waves and very hot/cold days; and the  scale of emissions reductions required from 1990 levels to achieve  different CO2 concentration stabilizations. Several delegates also  proposed to add key uncertainties, including the probability  distribution associated with temperature and sea-level projections  and issues related to large-scale abrupt/non-linear changes.

Concerning robust findings on climate change impacts, there were  proposals for greater emphasis on both positive and negative  impacts. Emphasizing the need for balance, Chair Watson  underscored that most people will be adversely affected by, rather  than benefit from, climate change, and that the list should focus  on large-scale impacts.

On request of the Chair, the lead authors presented a revised  list. After clarifying the confidence level underlying some of its  items, delegates adopted the revised list.

Several different proposals were put forward for additions to the  list of robust findings on adaptation and mitigation options.  Chair Watson requested a contact group, including the lead  authors, to prepare a revised list that would ensure balance. When  later presenting the revised list to Plenary, he noted that  several hours had gone into its preparation and urged delegates to  accept it without change. Delegates approved the revised list.

### Approved Answer:

The approved answer to this question defines a  'robust finding' as one that holds under a variety of approaches,  methods, models and assumptions and one that is expected to be  relatively unaffected by uncertainties. It defines 'key  uncertainties' as those that, if reduced, may lead to new and  robust findings. A table lists examples of robust findings and key  uncertainties. The answer also lists important areas where further  work is required. A graph illustrates past and future CO2  atmospheric concentrations.

### ADOPTION OF THE UNDERLYING LONGER PART OF THE SYNTHESIS REPORT

Delegates considered the underlying longer part of the Synthesis  Report on the final two days of the session. The adopted longer  part expands on the SPM, providing further detail, additional  data, and more examples and figures to answer the nine policy- relevant questions. Introducing the document, Chair Watson noted  that it had been revised during the week to ensure consistency  with the approved SPM and to take government comments into  account. Participants considered and adopted the underlying longer  part paragraph-by-paragraph, a new procedure for the IPCC. A  number of amendments were proposed and adopted, mostly correcting  errors and reconciling the text with the SPM.

## FUTURE OF THE IPCC

Participants discussed the future of the IPCC throughout the week.  Chair Watson drew the attention of delegates to recommended  decisions on this issue, which had been revised following  consideration at IPCC-17 and additional comments from governments.  Before considering the decisions, Chair Watson raised the overall  issue of the continuation of the IPCC. He recalled the unanimous  agreement expressed at IPCC-17 that the Panel should continue its  work, and reported that both IPCC's parent organizations, WMO and  UNEP, had now formally endorsed the agreement to continue. Chair  Watson stated that no further decision on this particular issue  was therefore necessary. Participants then discussed eleven  decisions pertaining to the future work of the IPCC.

### Decision 1:

Under this decision, delegates agreed that the IPCC  should continue to prepare comprehensive assessments, including an  underlying report, SPM and Technical Summary from each working  group. The decision also recommends that the IPCC Bureau examine  the feasibility of: shortening the underlying reports and  increasing their focus on new findings; and shortening the SPMs as  well as making them more comprehensible to policymakers.

### Decision 2:

This decision concerns the timing of the Fourth  Assessment Report. Some delegates called for the Fourth Assessment  Report to be completed by 2006, emphasizing the needs of policy- makers for updated information and noting that negotiations on  second period commitments under the UNFCCC are due to start by  2005. Others proposed a later date, noting that scientists must  not be overloaded, and that new scientific findings must be  available before a new assessment is prepared. Several  participants proposed to defer a decision, stating that the IPCC  needs to first consider its overall work programme and consult the  UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice  (SBSTA) on its requirements. Delegates decided to invite the  current IPCC Bureau to consult with the expert community and the  SBSTA as an input for further consideration of this issue at IPCC- 19.

### Decision 3:

This decision considers whether Working Group I, which  assesses past and future climate change, should produce its report  before Working Group II, which assesses impacts, adaptation and  vulnerability. Several participants noted the link between this  decision and the timing of the Fourth Assessment Report. Chair  Watson proposed to invite the current Bureau to consult with  Working Group Co-Chairs and lead authors on their experience in  preparing the TAR, as an input for further consideration of this  issue at IPCC-19. After some debate, delegates agreed to this  proposal.

### Decision 4:

Delegates approved this decision, which: endorses the  preparation of Special Reports; requests the Bureau to develop a  framework and set of criteria for establishing priorities to be  approved by the IPCC Plenary; and states that the preparation of  Special Reports will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

### Decision 5:

Delegates approved this decision, which states that  the IPCC will: consider requests for technical papers, special  reports or methodological work received from the UNFCCC; and take  decisions on a case-by-case basis, using the priority framework  and criteria developed under Decision 4.

### Decision 6:

This decision addresses whether the IPCC should be  responsive to requests from other conventions and organizations to  prepare reports.

Several delegates expressed caution, noting resource implications  and emphasizing that requests from other bodies should be  considered according to the priority framework developed under  Decision 4. One participant stated that the UNFCCC should be  consulted on the relevance of any requests received to climate  change. Delegates approved a decision stating that the IPCC will  consider requests for Technical Papers, Special Reports or  methodological work received from other bodies, and will take  decisions on a case-by-case basis, using the priority framework  and criteria developed under Decision 4. Delegates also agreed  that the Panel should provide specific guidance to the new Bureau  on issues that need to be considered in the formulation of the  priority framework and criteria under Decision 4.

### Decision 7:

This decision concerns possible changes to the  preparation, peer review and acceptance/approval procedures for  Special Reports. Delegates decided to make no change to existing  procedures for the time being, and approved a decision to that  effect.

### Decision 8:

This decision concerns the appropriate working group  structure of the IPCC. Chair Watson noted that there appeared to  be consensus to maintain the current three working groups, while  recognizing the need to: enhance coordination between the working  groups; improve the consideration of overlapping and cross-cutting  issues; improve the treatment of economic aspects in Working  Groups I and II; and strengthen the treatment of technical aspects  in Working Group III.

In the ensuing discussion, all delegates expressed support for  maintaining the three working groups. Several participants called  for the establishment of a new body to address developing country  participation and others suggested that a Bureau member be charged  with working on this issue. One participant called for greater  cooperation with scientific bodies of other conventions.

Discussion also took place on the degree of oversight that the  Plenary should exert over the working groups' plans to address  overlapping issues. Several delegates stated that the Plenary  should not 'micromanage' the working groups and guarded against  excessive bureaucracy. Several delegates underscored the  importance of not going against the IPCC's agreed principles and  procedures.

Delegates agreed to endorse the continuation of the current  working group structure. Chair Watson clarified that the plans of  the working groups to deal with cross-cutting issues would be  considered by the Plenary as part of broader discussions on the  working groups' work programmes at a future session.

### Decision 9:

Delegates agreed to address this decision, on the  management of special reports, at IPCC-19.

### Decision 10:

This decision addresses the question of whether the  Task Force on Inventories (TFI) should remain a task force or  become a fourth working group. There was broad agreement on the  Chair's recommendation that the TFI remain a task force.  Participants also discussed the composition of the TFI Bureau and  its links to the IPCC Bureau. Delegates agreed that the TFI Bureau  will be composed of two Co-Chairs (one from a developed and one  from a developing country), who are members of the IPCC Bureau and  of twelve additional TFI Bureau members. The importance of  ensuring the technical expertise of Bureau members was emphasized.

### Approved Answer:

This decision addresses the appropriate size,  structure and geographical representation of the IPCC Bureau.

One delegate proposed to increase the membership of the Bureau to  50 or more, pointing to the greater decision-making  responsibilities placed on it, given that Plenary sessions are now  held less frequently. Chair Watson, supported by several  delegates, noted that the real issue of concern is not the size of  the Bureau, but its mandate and the fact that some members do not  participate actively in its work and therefore do not fully  represent their regions.

Chair Watson proposed to maintain the current Bureau structure,  suggesting that procedures be considered at a future session to  enable regional groups to replace Bureau members who fail to  participate actively and urged regional groups to select  representatives who will truly represent their regions. Delegates  agreed to the Chair's proposal. The Bureau will keep its 30  members with the current geographic balance, including a Chair,  three Vice-Chairs with specific responsibilities, the two Co- Chairs and six Bureau members of each working group, and the two  Co-Chairs of the TFI.

## PREPARATORY WORK ON LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY

Delegates considered this issue on Wednesday, 26 September, and  Friday, 28 September. On Wednesday, Chair Watson explained that a  draft decision on land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)  prepared at the resumed UNFCCC COP-6 had requested the IPCC to:  elaborate guidelines and prepare a report on good practice  guidance; develop definitions for degradation and devegetation;  and develop practicable methodologies to factor out direct human- induced changes in carbon stocks, emissions and removals. He  further explained that the SBSTA is likely to request the IPCC to  assist it with additional work on biome-specific forest  definitions and on issues relating to afforestation and  reforestation activities under the Clean Development Mechanism. He  noted, however, that these tasks still need to be formally  endorsed by UNFCCC COP-7. Chair Watson invited delegates to  consider and approve a proposed work programme to carry out the  tasks prepared by the TFI Bureau.

One participant stated that the Plenary should consider all tasks  requested of the IPCC by the resumed UNFCCC COP-6, not just those  relating to LULUCF. Dennis Tirpak, representing the UNFCCC  Secretariat, together with Chair Watson, clarified that the  request to elaborate guidelines/good practice guidance for the  LULUCF sector did not only come from the resumed UNFCCC COP-6, but  had been requested previously by SBSTA and discussed at IPCC-17.

Based on this clarification, Chair Watson invited participants to  focus first on the individual proposed work programme for  guidelines/good practice guidance. Many delegations emphasized the  importance of approving this work programme. A number of specific  issues were raised, including: the need to address remote sensing  methodologies and cross-cutting issues; the importance of balanced  geographic representation among authors; and links with the  preparation of national communications under the UNFCCC,  especially in developing countries where there is a need to  improve data preparation methods and emission factors. Delegates  approved the work programme.

On definitions for degradation and devegetation, Chair Watson  invited delegates to discuss and approve the work programme in  principle, subject to a later discussion on its priority in the  context of overall requests endorsed by UNFCCC COP-7. Several  delegates and the TFI Co-Chairs expressed concern at the lack of  clarity in the request to the IPCC, urging that further guidance  be sought from the UNFCCC SBSTA and UNFCCC COP-7 on the exact  nature of the task. Chair Watson proposed to invite the TFI Bureau  to continue the scoping of its work programme, and submit more  detailed terms of reference to IPCC-19, based on further guidance  obtained at COP-7. Delegates agreed with the Chair's proposal.

On Friday, delegates continued their consideration of tasks under  the proposed work programme. On the factoring out of direct human- induced changes, several delegates stated that the proposed work  programme did not adequately reflect: the complexity of the issue;  the need for new advances in science; and the importance of  involving Working Groups I and II. Several participants recalled  that UNFCCC COP-7 has not yet formally approved this request and  that the COP may make other requests.

Delegates approved a decision requesting the working groups and  TFI Bureau to produce scoping papers, for consideration at IPCC- 19, on any activities that UNFCCC COP-7 may request, including on  the factoring out of direct human-induced changes and other LULUCF  issues.

## PREPARATION OF A TECHNICAL PAPER ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIOLOGICAL  DIVERSITY

Delegates considered this issue on Wednesday, 26 September. Chair  Watson recalled that IPCC-17 had approved the preparation of a  technical paper on climate change and biological diversity, as  requested by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Habiba  Gitay, convening lead author, introduced the scoping paper for the  Technical Paper. She explained that the technical paper would only  draw on existing IPCC material, and noted that, in response to a  request from the SBSTA, it would also look at links between  climate change and desertification. She emphasized that the report  would be written by members of the CBD roster of experts in  conjunction with IPCC authors in order to ensure coordination.

Widespread support was expressed for the scoping paper. Some  delegates sought clarification on its approach and content, and  others suggested specific topics that should be fully covered,  including: mountain area biodiversity; adaptation; and  biodiversity in countries particularly vulnerable to climate  change and to climate change mitigation action listed in UNFCCC  Article 4.8. One representative expressed concern that the focus  on biodiversity should not lead to a neglect of desertification.

In summarizing the discussion, Chair Watson encouraged developing  countries to nominate authors for the paper to ensure that issues  of specific concern to them will be adequately addressed.  Delegates approved the scoping paper.

## PREPARATION OF A SPECIAL REPORT ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABLE  DEVELOPMENT

On Wednesday, 26 September, Chair Watson introduced a scoping  paper for a proposed special report on climate change and  sustainable development. Mohan Munasinghe, Vice-Chair of Working  Group III, explained that the aim of the proposed special report  was to examine the implications of climate change and response  options for the sustainability of future development, as well as  the implications of development strategies for climate change and  response options. He noted that this focus on sustainable  development was part of the 'unfinished business' of the TAR.  Emphasizing links with the 2002 World Summit for Sustainable  Development (WSSD), he underscored that the report would have a  practical approach and would avoid 'philosophical' issues.

In the ensuing discussion, all delegates acknowledged the link  between climate change and sustainable development. Many supported  the preparation of a special report and called for work to start  immediately, noting that this would enable better coverage of  sustainable development issues in the Fourth Assessment Report.  Some participants called for caution, emphasizing that the report  had to be focused, relevant and provide added value. Expressing  concern over the scope and process of the proposed special report,  a delegate proposed an alternative 'phased approach' that would  begin with the preparation of a technical paper based on existing  IPCC material. Chair Watson called for a show of hands on whether  delegates favored a special report or the alternative phased  approach. Noting roughly equal support for both options, he  encouraged delegates to consult informally on the issue.

On Saturday, 29 September, delegates considered an outline for a  technical paper on climate change and sustainable development,  prepared by an informal group as a first step in a possible phased  approach to the issue. Several participants expressed support for  a technical paper, although some cautioned that formal approval of  its preparation should await a more detailed scoping paper.  Delegates approved the preparation of a technical paper in  principle, with a decision to be taken by the IPCC Bureau at its  next meeting, based on a more detailed scoping paper and comments  to be submitted by governments.

## OTHER ISSUES

### PROGRAMME AND BUGET FOR 2002-2004

On Saturday, 29 September, Leo  Meyer, Chair of the IPCC Financial Task Team, introduced a draft  decision on the IPCC Work Programme and Budget for 2002-2004. He  noted that 2002 would be a quiet year for the IPCC, but that  resource demands will increase thereafter as preparations for the  Fourth Assessment Report begin. He also noted that there was a  substantial carry-over from 2001. Chair Watson proposed to add a  provision in the budget for the publication of the Synthesis  Report as a stand-alone document. Delegates accepted this  proposal, and the budget was approved.

### IPCC COMMUNICATION STRATEGY

Delegates considered the IPCC  Communication strategy on Saturday, 29 September. Rajendra  Pachauri, IPCC Vice-Chair and Chair of the Ad Hoc Group on the  IPCC Communication Strategy, reported on: improvements to the IPCC  web site; strategies for the distribution and dissemination of  IPCC reports; the development of a popular version of the TAR and  Special Reports by UNEP; outreach activities by Working Group III;  and planned IPCC events at UNFCCC COP-7 and the WSSD. He also  highlighted the importance of engaging more actively with the  popular media and translating IPCC material into non-UN languages.  Supported by Chair Watson and several delegates, Pachauri called  for a significant increase in resources for the communication  strategy.

### TIMING OF THE ELECTION OF A NEW BUREAU

On Friday, 28 September,  Chair Watson reported a decision by the current Bureau that the  next Bureau should be elected at IPCC-19 in April 2002. Delegates  endorsed this decision.

### APPROVAL OF THE DRAFT REPORT OF THE SEVENTEENTH SESSION

The draft  report of the seventeenth session was approved without comment.

### OTHER MATTERS

Yuri Izrael, IPCC Vice-Chair, introduced a proposal  for an IPCC technical paper on levels of greenhouse gases in the  atmosphere preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with  the climate system. Chair Watson recalled that this proposal had  been presented to the IPCC Bureau, which had decided to request a  scoping paper for consideration at IPCC-19.

Delegates also briefly considered priorities for future work.  Chair Watson noted that an in-depth discussion on this issue will  take place at IPCC-19.

## CLOSING PLENARY

Chair Watson expressed satisfaction at the successful  approval/adoption of the Synthesis Report. He said that, despite  concerns that the new paragraph-by-paragraph adoption process  would lead to lengthy debate, this approach had worked well and  had demonstrated that the IPCC could evolve in its work. He  thanked all participants for their hard work, and stated that the  constructive comments received from governments on the draft  Synthesis Report had made an important contribution to the success  of the session. He paid tribute to the dedication of IPCC  Secretary Sundararaman, who is retiring at the end of the year.

Several other delegates expressed satisfaction at the success of  the session and echoed the tribute to Secretary Sundararaman.

Secretary Sundararaman thanked all delegates for their support,  recalling how the IPCC's work had developed since 1988. He  expressed particular satisfaction at his involvement in efforts to  increase the participation of developing countries and underscored  that such efforts should continue.

Chair Watson declared the meeting closed at 9:45 pm.
