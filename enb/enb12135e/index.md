# SBI

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates adopted the draft  conclusions on national communications of Annex I Parties.  They also adopted conclusions on the report of the first  meeting of the Consultative Group on Experts and on the  provision of financial support for non-Annex I Party  national communications.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

On the financial mechanism, delegates  adopted draft conclusions, with minor amendments, on the  progress report on the GEF review of enabling activities  and its capacity building activities.

On additional guidance to the GEF on support to the IPCC,  the EU said that, whereas FCCC Parties should send signals  to the GEF that the proposed IPCC project could benefit the  process, it was not appropriate for them to prejudge the  GEF Council's decision-making. He proposed replacing  'approval' with 'consideration' in the draft conclusions.  SBI adopted the draft conclusions, as amended.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

The JWG continued its consideration of the Co-Chairs' Text.  On Scope of Application, CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA  and opposed by ARGENTINA and CHILE, suggested listing the  Annex I Parties' commitments to which the compliance system  would apply, and said issues of compliance with other  commitments would be dealt with under the Multilateral  Consultative Process. On Establishment, Structure and  Functions, the US, with AUSTRALIA, said the text should  emphasize the two-branch structure. CANADA specified that  the outcomes of the facilitative branch would not be  limited to outcomes of a non-mandatory nature. On  Structure, SAUDI ARABIA, with SAMOA, said members should  equally represent the five UN regional groups. NEW ZEALAND  sought greater representation of Annex I Parties. On  Functions, many delegates opposed a screening function. The  US urged automatic application of mandatory outcomes. SAUDI  ARABIA suggested that the compliance body determine  mandatory outcomes or consequences only for Annex I  Parties.

On Submission of Questions, several delegates stressed the  importance of Article 8 (review of information) Expert  Review Teams (ERTs) reports. SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by NEW  ZEALAND, supported a role for the COP/MOP. The US proposed  that Parties should be able to raise questions regarding  another Party's implementation only with respect to the  facilitative branch. The EU proposed that the Secretariat  also be able to refer questions of compliance. On  Preliminary Examination of Questions, SAUDI ARABIA  suggested that multiple cases on the same type of issues  should be referred to the subsidiary bodies.

On Proceedings, several delegates stressed the importance  of integrating elements of the Annexes in the main text. On  Decision-Making, SAUDI ARABIA said decisions would be  adopted by consensus, and in case of failure, by a three- fourths majority vote. On Avoidance of Conflict of  Interest, CHINA proposed that the member of the compliance  body who is a national of a Party involved in a matter  shall not take part in ' the consideration of the matter.'  CANADA added that this includes members having a direct or  indirect interest in the matter.  On Sources of  Information, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by NEW ZEALAND,  distinguished between mandatory and non-mandatory sources.  The US, with NEW ZEALAND, suggested the possibility that  NGOs submit information. He said the Party concerned should  have the opportunity to respond to the information  submitted. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, the US and SAMOA said  the issue of confidentiality of information might conflict  with the principle of transparency and needed further  thought.

On COP/MOP, SWITZERLAND, with NEW ZEALAND, said it would  'take note' of the compliance body's reports. On Outcomes  and Consequences, SAUDI ARABIA said the CDM should not be  addressed under the compliance system. With CHINA, he added  that references to 'Party' with respect to eligibility  requirements should be prefaced by 'Annex I.' BRAZIL, with  SAMOA and the EU, suggested framing 'financial penalty' as  a separate option. NEW ZEALAND introduced an option  permitting purchase at a penalty rate, inter alia, from  future commitment periods. AUSTRALIA suggested adding that  if an Article 4 (joint fulfillment) Party becomes  ineligible to use the mechanisms, all other members of the  agreement would lose access to the mechanisms. On Other  Provisions, the G-77/CHINA suggested requesting the  Secretariat to prepare possible options for the adoption of  procedures and mechanisms related to compliance. On  Annexes, Parties differed on the need to integrate them  into the main text.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### LULUCF

Delegates discussed changes to the draft  conclusions. Noting the concern of many non-Annex I Parties  with regard to understanding the IPCC Special Report on  LULUCF, Co-Chair Thorgeirsson said an extra day had been  reserved for a briefing at the workshop in Poland in July.  The G-77/CHINA said this did not reflect their request for  regional workshops, and delegates agreed to an additional  conclusion inviting the SBSTA to encourage workshops.  AUSTRALIA and the EU said capacity building should be  considered within the broader context of SBSTA's work.

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted the proposal to convene  an intersessional meeting between SB-13 and COP-6 to  support the negotiation process. He urged delegates to  focus on requirements for COP-6, noting that capacity  building could be achieved over a longer time period. AOSIS  stressed the importance of regional workshops and  questioned the mandate for an intersessional meeting.

AUSTRALIA called for a compilation of central textual  proposals to assist work at SBSTA-13. The EU distributed  draft conclusions requesting parties to provide textual  proposals to be presented with 1 August submissions and  requesting the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis according  to specific elements. CANADA, AOSIS and others proposed  changes, and discussions continued late into the night.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Kjell√©n outlined a cluster of  issues to be addressed in drafting the text for negotiation  at SBSTA-13. SAUDI ARABIA urged that the consolidated text  form the basis for negotiations, and emphasized the need to  include all proposals. The EU suggested that the  consolidated text simply be a reflection of discussions  that may form the basis for later negotiation.

JAMAICA underlined the need for future workshops aimed at  concrete actions. The PHILIPPINES, with the US, supported  investigating connections between climate change and  extreme weather events, while NIGERIA stressed the need for  preparedness to cope with such events in developing  countries. The UK said identification of actions is only  possible with an understanding of the relationship between  climate impacts and other phenomena. The EU said scientific  uncertainty should not be a reason for inaction.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates considered the draft  conclusions on Guidelines under Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the  Kyoto Protocol. Delegates agreed on the text, including  language highlighting agreement on the guidelines under  Article 5.1 (national systems) and the preparation of a  draft decision at SBSTA-13 to be adopted at COP-6.  Delegates considered the General Approach to Review of the  Co-Chairs Proposed Elements of Draft Guidelines under  Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol and provided guidance to  the Secretariat in its elaboration of the text. The EU said  the guidelines should include the elements for review under  the FCCC and the Protocol, but would single out those parts  of the guidelines not applicable to Annex I Parties that  are not Parties to the Protocol. The G-77/CHINA suggested  adding the objective of ensuring that the compliance body  has the information necessary to carry out its functions.  The EU said all ERTs reports would be forwarded to the  compliance body.

### MECHANISMS

Delegates considered the draft consolidated  text on mechanisms. Deliberations focused on the nature of  discussions necessary at this stage. While AUSTRALIA,  POLAND, CANADA and the US favored bracketing text, the G-77/CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA stressed that this was not a  negotiation and suggested instead that Parties focus only  on 'inclusions' to the text. Delegates considered Part One  of the Consolidated Text on Mechanisms relating to JI and  indicated areas where specific written proposals would be  submitted and text added. Participants differed on the need  for, inter alia, the Executive Board, sinks in JI, share of  proceeds, and the appendix on supplementarity.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Delegates considered draft  conclusions on policies and measures (P&Ms). The EU tabled  additional paragraphs on conclusions, including a proposed  Terms of Reference (ToR) for a possible workshop on P&Ms.  The G-77/CHINA presented alternative text on ToR.  On the  original draft conclusions, delegates agreed to, inter  alia: replace 'best' with 'good' practices; and specify  reference to paragraph (b) of Protocol Article 2.1. The EU,  POLAND, SWITZERLAND and the G-77/CHINA, opposed by  AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and the US, urged that the ToR be  considered prior to COP-6. Delegates agreed to include, in  brackets, EU text encouraging parties to submit their views  at SBSTA-13 on ToR and on the timing of the process, and  the G-77/CHINA's proposal to refer to holding a workshop in  'early' 2001.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This group considered the Chair's text  on capacity building in developing countries. On the  principles outlined in the text, issues highlighted include  the need for country-driven capacity building, partnership  with developed countries, and financial resources.

On Strategy, delegates highlighted subregional or regional  approaches and the need to consider past and ongoing  activities. The G-77/CHINA proposed addressing financing  and implementation as separate sections. The NETHERLANDS  suggested accounting for capacity-building when planning  the GEF's third replenishment. UGANDA said funding for  capacity building should be additional to ODA. On the role  of the Secretariat, delegates said it should avoid an  operational role but act as a facilitator.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The Friends of the Chair continued to  consider actions required in relation to technology needs  and needs assessment, enabling assessment, and technology  information. The group also considered and agreed on the  SBSTA Chair's draft conclusions.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some participants were commenting on contrasting positions  emerging from certain EU members on nuclear technology  under the CDM. While one Party announced a strong 'anti'  stance, another publicly indicated its support for allowing  nuclear technology within the CDM. Speculation among a  number of participants centered on how this might impact  the eventual elaboration of the EU's position on this  issue.
