# ROUND TABLES

### ROUND TABLE II 'CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

' COP-8  President Baalu opened the session and Co-Chair Valli Moosa (South  Africa) said the Delhi Declaration should draw links between COP-7,  the WSSD, and COP-8. He highlighted consumption, and energy supply  and access as issues where climate change and sustainable  development meet. He supported adaptation, operationalization of  the CDM and the new Funds.

UGANDA recalled the Millennium Development Goals and said climate  change 'cripples' developing country economies, hindering  sustainable development. SLOVAKIA stressed the need to move beyond  politicized negotiations to real action. COLUMBIA said that  climate change is both a development and environment issue.

NAMIBIA announced its ratification of the Protocol, and a number  of countries urged entry into force.

GREECE, BELGIUM, SPAIN and SLOVENIA supported renewable energy and  energy efficiency. GERMANY said the EU would build a coalition of  like-minded countries willing to commit themselves to timetables  and targets for increasing renewable energy use. Stressing that  combating poverty is the agreed priority, KUWAIT said issues  related to renewable energy should not be introduced at this point.

PORTUGAL said progress at COP-8 had been constructive,  particularly regarding the completion of guidelines for reporting  and review under Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information).  FRANCE recognized the work of the IPCC Third Assessment Report  (TAR) as pivotal to the UNFCCC process.

NIGERIA emphasized social development and poverty alleviation.  PERU, RWANDA and GAMBIA called for concrete measures to support  and enhance capacity in vulnerable countries, and MAURITIUS called  for Parties to give practical meaning to technology transfer.  MOZAMBIQUE urged financial support for implementing NAPAs and  strengthening existing national focal points.NAMIBIA said  developing countries must be allowed to expand their per-capita  energy consumption. GUYANA said the new Funds should be made  operational. KIRIBATI underscored the need for development  projects to incorporate climate change considerations. ISRAEL said  that it was developing a greenhouse gas emissions reduction policy.

On the CDM, UGANDA said the poorest and most vulnerable countries,  many of which are in Africa, may not attract profit-driven CDM  projects. The INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE cautioned that CDM  modalities are becoming too complex, and stressed the need for  regulatory certainty for businesses to make investments.  BANGLADESH supported a multilateral CDM programme for LDCs.

The US said that its climate approach is grounded in sound  economic policy and noted its commitment to reduce the greenhouse  gas intensity of its economy by 18% over ten years. The US claimed  that economic growth is the key to environmental progress. GERMANY  responded by calling for 'absolute' emissions reductions, noting  that a failure to address climate change will result in economic  harm.

Regarding future actions, GERMANY said it would commit itself to a  40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by 2020  if all developed countries committed themselves to further  reductions, and the EU committed itself to emission reductions of  about 30%. SWEDEN, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and BELGIUM,  and opposed by OMAN and NIGERIA, called for a dialogue on  developing country commitments. ARGENTINA said that Annex I  countries have yet to take the lead on climate change. Co-Chair  Moosa summarized the discussions and closed the session.

### ROUND TABLE III 'WRAP-UP

' In the afternoon, COP President Baalu  opened the third and final Round Table. Addressing the Delhi  Declaration, ITALY said it should consider action beyond 2012.  NORWAY called for a broader climate change regime. CANADA said it  should consider, inter alia: ratification of the Protocol;  recommendations of the IPCC TAR; efforts to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions; and the UNFCCC's ultimate objectives. The COOK ISLANDS  called for a World Climate Day. Stressing that the UNFCCC is not  an energy convention, SAUDI ARABIA said that the Declaration  should be a consensus document prioritizing adaptation to climate  impacts and impacts of Annex I response measures.

On non-Annex I commitments, the G-77/CHINA opposed any text that  would infer new commitments. VENEZUELA observed that action on  technology transfer and finance by Annex I countries had been  unsatisfactory and called on the COP to address compliance under  the UNFCCC and the Marrakesh Accords. Claiming a right to  development, CUBA opposed new commitments for developing countries.  The EU underscored that mitigation has proven to be a powerful  force for technological change and economic development. ICELAND  addressed carbon intensities and the need to stimulate the  development of technologies to avoid wasteful emissions. INDIA  called for the provision of sufficient environmental 'space' for  developing countries to develop. THAILAND asked Parties to  differentiate between luxury and survival emissions.

LIBYA called on all Parties to honor their commitments under the  UNFCCC. Noting that biodiversity, coral reefs and the existence of  some cultures are threatened by global warming, PALAU called for  immediate greenhouse gas emission reductions by all Parties.

QATAR, EGYPT and ALGERIA opposed new commitments and urged Parties  to operationalize UNFCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects).

On the need to address sustainable development, MALAYSIA called  upon the COP to develop a work programme addressesing climate  impacts on food security, water resources, coastal zones and  oceans and renewable energy. BRAZIL said polices and measures must  be linked with actions to promote renewable energy, technology  transfer and capacity-building. The EU stressed that renewable  energy exemplified the synergies between sustainable development  and climate change.

AUSTRIA drew links between climate change and energy consumption  patterns, renewable energy and natural resources. CHILE emphasized  that national strategies for sustainable development must address  adaptation and mitigation policies. CHAD stressed that the only  legally valid instrument for reducing greenhouse gases is the  Protocol and, with TANZANIA, SENEGAL, AUSTRIA, MALAWI, and NORWAY,  called for ratification by all countries.

On the CDM, PAPUA NEW GUINEA called for greater forest and  biodiversity incentives. BRAZIL supported projects in large cities.  EGYPT said its national strategy for CDM would include provisions  for environmental integrity, sustainable economic development, and  conservation of natural resources. TANZANIA stressed equity in the  distribution of projects.

On capacity-building, NEPAL, for LDCs, stressed that institutional  capacity-building is a priority need and called for the immediate  implementation of the work programme under UNFCCC Article 6  (education, training and public awareness).

COP President Baalu invited spokespersons from regional groups to  attend an open-ended informal discussion on the Declaration and  closed the high-level segment.

# CONTACT GROUP

### NON-ANNEX I ISSUES

This contact group, chaired by Jos√© Romero  (Switzerland), met throughout the day. In the morning, delegates  discussed the structure of the improved guidelines. In the  afternoon, SBI Chair Estrada convened a high-level contact group  and introduced a new draft of the guidelines. BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, accepted the text as a basis for discussion. The EU,  with AUSTRALIA, asked for additional time to consider the text.  Chair Estrada suspended the meeting for informal consultations.  Upon reconvening, Parties aired several concerns, which Chair  Estrada said could not be integrated into the guidelines, but  could be mentioned in his oral report to the COP. The US proposed  moving a paragraph into the decision text that states that non- Annex I Parties can use elements from the guidelines for Annex I  national communications on a voluntary basis.

On decision text adopting the improved guidelines, the EU,  supported by the US and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, asked for text  noting the need for review of the guidelines. JAPAN, opposed by  the G-77/CHINA, preferred stating language that the guidelines  'shall be used' instead of 'should be used' to ensure the  comparability of national communications. AUSTRALIA, opposed by  the G-77/CHINA, proposed adding a procedural paragraph that would  list work to be done. Chair Estrada said that there was no  consensus on any of these proposals. The G-77/CHINA opposed a  three-year time frame for completion of national communications  after receipt of funding. Parties disagreed on, inter alia,  whether developing countries should use the guidelines 'to the  extent that financial resources and their capacities allow.' On decision text regarding new terms of reference for the  Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national  communications (CGE), the EU called for the initiation of a  process for the voluntary review of national communications. Chair  Estrada noted that the review of national communications was a key  difference between the processes of Annex I and non-Annex I  national communications. Following a query from JAPAN on the  funding for CGE meetings, the US said she was surprised to hear  that funding came from the core budget, and that she could not  agree to the text without further consultations. Chair Estrada  said that he would take the text as it stood to the plenary for  Parties to accept or reject.

# SBI

Chair Estrada convened the SBI late in the evening.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

On election of officers other than the  Chair, Chair Estrada noted that conclusions will be completed by  Friday morning and announced by COP-8 President Baalu.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Consideration of the fourth  compilation and synthesis of initial national communications:  Parties agreed the draft decision for consideration by the COP  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.23).

###     Improvement of the guidelines for the preparation of non-Annex I  national communications

Chair Estrada said the draft decision was  not yet available. Noting that delegations had a number of  suggestions, additions and proposals for the document, he said  Parties had agreed to adopt the guidelines 'in a spirit of  compromise.' The EU requested to see the decision. Chair Estrada  suspended the meeting for 30 minutes. Upon reconvening, the EU  repeated her request to see the text. CANADA stressed 'normal' UN  procedures by which documents are seen before they are adopted.  Chair Estrada adjourned the meeting, saying the text would be  ready for consideration Friday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The abrupt adjournment of the SBI Thursday night left many  observers 'astonished' at Chair Estrada's proposal to adopt a  decision on non-Annex I issues without the final text being  available. Some observers expressed further concern at the 'weak'  leadership of the COP-8 Presidency, and wondered whether the Delhi  Declaration would be withdrawn in the end.

On another note, there was news that a new interest group  consisting of research NGOs, RINGOs, would be officially announced  on Friday.
