On Saturday, contact groups were convened to continue work on  Articles 5, 7 and 8, the IPCC TAR, P&Ms, greenhouse gas  inventories, and LULUCF under the CDM.

# SBSTA

### INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

After a presentation from a  representative of RAMSAR, the EU suggested that SBSTA consider a  draft decision on cooperation with other conventions and, with  SWITZERLAND, TUVALU, and NORWAY, proposed inviting the Secretariat  to explore methodological issues relating to emissions from  international transport, and report results to SB-17. This  proposal was opposed by AUSTRALIA, the US and SAUDI ARABIA. The EU  said it is considering applying unilateral measures to reduce  emissions from international transport if no significant progress  is achieved within the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO) and International Maritime Organization (IMO). Chair  Thorgeirsson said he would prepare draft conclusions on  cooperation with UN bodies, and that informal consultations would  be conducted on cooperation with other conventions.

### ARTICLE 6

On education, training, and public awareness, IPCC  Executive Secretary Geoffrey Love reported on the status of  translation of IPCC documents into UN languages other than  English. Parties discussed the report from a recent workshop to  develop a work programme on Article 6 activities  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.10). Many Parties welcomed the discussion on  the issue. MALAYSIA, SENEGAL, NAMIBIA, BRAZIL, and ERITREA  underscored the need for Article 6 activities to be country  driven. A contact group was convened.

### RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OZONE AND CLIMATE EFFORTS

Chair Thorgeirsson  recalled a COP-5 decision (17/CP.5) requesting information on  available and potential ways and means of limiting emissions of  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs), including  their use as replacements for ozone-depleting substances. Several  Parties stressed the importance of the IPCC and the Technical and  Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) of the Montreal Protocol in  providing information on this matter. INDIA said reduction in the  use of HFCs and PFCs could affect developing countries' economies.  The US said actions undertaken to reduce HCFs and PFCs must not  undermine the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. SWITZERLAND  favored a draft decision outlining actions for presentation to  COP-8. The EU noted that despite the current low contribution of  HFCs and PFCs to total greenhouse gas emissions, efforts are  necessary to avoid significant growth in these emissions. Chair  Thorgeirsson said Richard Bradley (US) would undertake informal  consultations on this issue.

### OTHER MATTERS

Parties addressed the proposal by Croatia under  UNFCCC Article 4.6 to adjust the base year for its greenhouse gas  inventory from 1990 to 1991. CROATIA, supported by CG-11, stressed  its special circumstances. The EU urged careful consideration of  this matter, and said that implementation of Article 4.6 must not  undermine the integrity of the Protocol. UGANDA cautioned that a  decision on this matter would set a precedent under this Article.  Chair Thorgeirsson asked Jim Penman (UK) to facilitate informal  consultations to prepare draft conclusions and a possible draft  decision on this matter.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

On Friday, the contact group considered the  draft document on the expedited procedure for the review for  reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms, while a small  drafting group worked on overall timeframes. Participants agreed  that Parties should give advance notice to the Secretariat on  requests for a review. The EU and INDIA supported extending review  time, if necessary, to ensure thoroughness. AUSTRALIA and others  opposed this, stressing resource implications and the Party's  responsibility to provide information.

On Saturday, the group reviewed the parts of the guidelines under  Articles 7 and 8 pending since COP-7, namely: reporting of  supplementary information under Article 7.1; reporting of  supplementary information under Article 7.2; review of information  on assigned amounts pursuant to Article 3.7 and 3.8, ERUs, CERs,  AAUs and RMUs; and review of national registries. BRAZIL, for the  G-77/CHINA, said it was waiting for outcomes from the group on  LULUCF under the CDM. NEW ZEALAND distributed a non-paper to  facilitate work.

Co-Chair Helen Plume asked delegates to submit any proposals on  review of national registries in writing to the Secretariat and  said a new copy of the Working Paper incorporating Party views  would be available Monday morning. Parties also engaged in an  initial exchange of views on review of demonstrable progress under  Article 3.2, to be revisited during SBSTA's second week. The  Secretariat distributed draft conclusions.

### AIJ

The contact group on the uniform reporting format (URF) for  AIJ under the pilot phase completed its work on the draft revised  URF (FCCC/SB/2000/6/Add.1) on Friday. Delegates agreed to several  amendments to the sections on summarizing the AIJ project and on  financing, and approved the draft annexes. Following informal  consultations, participants approved the section on mutually  agreed assessment procedures. They also inserted a sentence in the  chapeau clarifying that the content provided by the revised URF is  'for informational purposes only and should not be construed as  adopting the underlying concepts.' Parties concluded their work by approving draft conclusions for  consideration by SBSTA, as well as a draft COP-8 decision. The  draft conclusions agree on the revised URF and encourage Parties  involved in AIJ to submit reports using this URF. The draft  decision adopts the revised URF and urges Parties involved in AIJ  to use it.

### GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES

On Friday, Co-Chair Newton Paciornik  reminded Parties of the work ahead, including the revision of  outstanding text on reporting guidelines, the common reporting  format (CRF) tables, and pending issues held over from Thursday.  The EU read a proposal for a new paragraph on capturing carbon  from flue gases and Co-Chair Paciornik deferred it for  consideration at a later meeting. On uncertainties for reporting,  CANADA said these should be quantified and reported, but not in  the CRF, which compares data across parties. PERU recommended the  inclusion of uncertainties, while the US said uncertainties should  fall under national inventory reporting (NIR). On the NIR, Co- Chair Paciornik said the EU, CHINA, PERU and US should elaborate a  solution to unresolved differences. CHINA opposed a US proposal  that CRF tables contain key source categories, proposing that  uncertainties cover all categories. Co-Chair Audun Rosland invited  Parties to reach conclusions on pending issues by Saturday  morning. A sub-group met in the evening to consider the CRF  tables, with key outstanding issues including table 7 on  uncertainties for key sources (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.3).

On Saturday, Co-Chair Rosland explained the technical sub-group's  proposed editorial changes to the tables of the CRF, and outlined  proposals for resolving pending issues, including those relating  to base-years, key sources and uncertainties. Discussion focused  on the proposed structure of NIR, on when to use 'shall' or  'should' in the guidelines, and on how the guidelines will apply  to Parties that choose 1995 as their baseline under Protocol  Article 3.8.

### LULUCF UNDER THE CDM

This group met in afternoon and evening  sessions on Friday and an evening session on Saturday. On Friday,  Co-Chair Karsten Sach introduced a revised TOR and agenda for work  to develop definitions and modalities for including LULUCF under  the CDM. Participants debated how to take into consideration  accounting, reporting and review aspects when developing these, as  proposed by the G-77/CHINA. CANADA cautioned against moving beyond  the group's mandate.

The G-77/CHINA suggested compiling an options paper on modalities  for accounting, reporting and review aspects, while the EU, CANADA  and JAPAN preferred integrating these issues into the other  options papers. In the agenda for work, CHINA proposed moving up  deadlines to allow more time for preparation. Regarding  submissions on modalities, MALAYSIA stressed the need for initial  exchange of views.

On Saturday, Parties agreed on text relating to draft TOR and an  agenda for work to develop definitions and modalities, including  afforestation and reforestation activities under the CDM. On  definitions, Parties discussed a Canadian proposal to change the  baseline year under definitions of 'reforestation' from 1989 to  1999.

### IPCC TAR

On Friday evening, delegates met to consider the Co- Chairs' proposed draft conclusions on how the TAR can support the  work of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies, particularly the SBSTA. Co- Chair Rawleston Moore requested views on elements omitted from the  draft conclusions, and CHINA suggested specific issues related to  technology transfer, which the G-77/CHINA suggested could be  addressed by the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT). The  EU suggested a greater focus on the IPCC Special Report on  Technology Transfer.

Parties continued their deliberations on Saturday morning, basing  their discussions on a Co-Chairs' list of issues raised Friday,  including financial matters, the Protocol, adaptation, science and  organizing principles. CHINA said any discussion on the Protocol  should consider the impacts of implementation, and SAUDI ARABIA  called for a scientific assessment of these impacts. On  adaptation, Co-Chair David Warrilow noted that no specific  subsidiary body agenda item addresses adaptation. The G-77/CHINA  supported more information on adaptation policy options, and JAPAN  said a mitigation portfolio was also necessary. A revised text  will be prepared by the Co-Chairs.

### ARTICLE 6

Parties suggested key words/concepts to guide the Co- Chairs' work in clarifying a draft work programme on facilitating  the implementation of Article 6, including: 'country driven,'  'appropriate international support and funding,' 'information  exchange,' 'cost effectiveness,' 'integration within sustainable  development priorities,' 'targeted audiences,' 'practical,' and  'sustained.' On the objectives of the work programme, the US and  others suggested using those contained in Article 6. On  priorities, Parties discussed identifying financial resources,  facilitating the exchange of information and improving IPCC  outreach as short-term needs, and improving national  communications, evaluation methods, and education curricula. The  group will reconvene Monday to consider draft conclusions and a  draft COP decision.

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): The contact group on P&Ms met on  Friday night and Saturday afternoon. On Friday, Co-Chair Pierre  Giroux (Canada) outlined the relevant COP-7 decision (13/CP.7) and  requested comments on how to move forward on implementing this  decision.

Several Parties emphasized the value of exchanging information and  sharing experiences. AUSTRALIA and the US supported a stock taking  exercise to review available information, including from recent  workshops. SAMOA, speaking for AOSIS, said the stock taking  exercise is set for SB-17. He endorsed continuing information  exchange, an examination of policy formulation processes, and  sectoral analysis. The EU called for a work programme to support  concrete activities. SWITZERLAND suggested developing a scoping  paper addressing topics such as reporting and review, and  methodological issues. The US proposed information sharing on  cost-benefit analyses used to evaluate P&Ms, and JAPAN highlighted  the importance of national circumstances.

On Saturday, Co-Chair Giroux introduced a one-page document  containing a table reflecting issues raised the previous evening.  The table included headings on the consideration of initial  results from actions taken under the COP-7 decision, and on a  framework for action. Several Parties said the table was a useful  basis for their work, and made suggestions for amendments or  additions to the headings and content. Co-Chair Giroux said text  would be developed based on Parties' comments and would be  available by Tuesday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The 'hot' issue among delegates over the weekend had less to do  with climate change than with national pride. As negotiations  continued on Friday and Saturday, many participants' attention  seemed to be on events thousands of miles away in Asia - and,  perhaps surprisingly, it was not those taking place in Bali.

Dozens of delegates had their eyes glued to television screens  showing the latest World Cup action, with many seemingly unable to  tear themselves away from 'crucial' games such as England's  thriller against Argentina. The level of interest was so great  that delegates postponed a LULUCF meeting to avoid a clash with  Brazil's fixture against China. Indeed, the passion displayed for  the 'beautiful game' here in Bonn had one observer jokingly  questioning what further tense clashes on the pitch might mean for  North-South relations.

On a more serious note, Canada's proposal to change the baseline  year for 'reforestation' caused a flurry of diplomatic activity  late Saturday night.
