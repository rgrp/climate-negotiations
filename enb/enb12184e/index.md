# NEGOTIATING GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### MECHANISMS

The negotiating group met in the morning to consider  the draft COP decision as well as the remaining issues related to  the Annex on modalities and procedures for the CDM. CANADA, the EU  and NORWAY sought clarification on elections of alternate  Executive Board members. NORWAY, opposed by SAMOA, suggested  removing reference to election of alternate Board members. Co- Chair Chow referred the issue to informal consultations between  concerned Parties. On registry requirements for the issuance of  CERs into the pending accounts, Parties adopted draft text under  the provision that they could revisit the matter after considering  the draft decisions and text on Article 7.4 (assigned amounts).

Delegates then turned their attention to the draft COP decision.  On the transfer of technology under the CDM, NORWAY, supported by  JAPAN, proposed amendments whereby furthering CDM project  activities should, as appropriate, lead to the transfer of sound  technology and knowledge in addition to that required under UNFCCC  Article 4.7 (technology transfer) and Protocol Article 10  (continuing implementation of existing commitments). The G-77/CHINA, BRAZIL, CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and THAILAND opposed the  amendments. The matter was referred to informal consultations.

On the tasks of the Executive Board, SAMOA, SWITZERLAND, NEW  ZEALAND and the EU highlighted the need for the Board to take into  account information from Parties, accredited observers and  stakeholders when reviewing CDM projects. CANADA called for time  to consider the issue. On developing definitions and modalities  for including afforestation and reforestation under the CDM, JAPAN  and COLOMBIA noted insufficient focus on the terms of reference  for their development. Delegates approved a proposal by the EU for  a workshop prior to SBSTA-16 to develop the terms of reference and  a work agenda, and for Parties to provide the Secretariat with  submissions by 1 February 2002. On the inclusion of definitions  and modalities in the Annex to the draft decision as it relates to  LULUCF, JAPAN, with CANADA, COLOMBIA, AUSTRALIA and CHILE,  proposed a number of references to the enhancement by sources and  removals by sinks. The EU, BRAZIL, INDIA, CHINA and SAMOA noted  that such modifications implied significant work at this late  stage of the meeting and said it risked undermining or prejudging  the work of SBSTA. After lengthy discussion, Co-Chair Estrada  adopted the text without Japan's proposed amendments. AUSTRALIA  and JAPAN highlighted a lack of consensus on the matter, which Co- Chair Estrada said would be adequately reflected.

On projects starting in 2000 and prior to the adoption of this  decision, CANADA, JAPAN and NORWAY sought clarification on the  suggested deadline of 31 December 2005 for such projects to be  eligible for validation and registration. BRAZIL opposed text  suggesting that a starting date for the crediting period prior to  the date of registration could be selected. He explained that a  project could not acquire credits for reductions accrued before  its registration, since it is only after registration that all the  provisions of modalities and procedures can be met. These matters  were set aside for further consultations.

On Saturday afternoon, the group reconvened to consider a Co- Chairs' non-paper on the modalities for accounting of assigned  amounts under Protocol Article 7.4, which had been prepared  following the submission of Parties' proposals. Co-Chair Estrada  introduced the non-paper, noting that parts of the text were still  incomplete, including the section on compilation and accounting of  emission inventories and assigned amounts. However, he indicated  that the most difficult issues were in the completed sections. He  noted concerns over the wording of the titles, and said one option  might be to delete these. Emphasizing that the non-paper sought to  achieve acceptable compromises on areas of divergence, he  requested Parties' general comments. The G-77/CHINA expressed a  willingness to work on the basis of the non-paper, while noting  insufficient time to consider it in detail. JAPAN highlighted  differences of opinion over recording assigned amount as a fixed  figure. Delegates then broke into a drafting group chaired by  Murray Ward (New Zealand) and considered the text in more detail,  identifying issues requiring further work. Areas of disagreement  included the carry over, technical issues related to Article 4  (joint fulfillment), and timing of issuance and cancellation of  sinks.

Following the extended Bureau meeting on Saturday night, delegates  reconvened in the negotiating group to continue consideration of  the CDM and emissions trading, as well as Article 7.4.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The negotiating group convened in  the morning for a full reading of all texts, which had been  revised to incorporate changes agreed in the drafting groups. A  paper on previously agreed guidelines for national systems under  Article 5.1 (national systems) was distributed and an editorial  amendment agreed. Delegates then agreed on the COP-7 and COP/MOP-1  draft decisions on Article 5.1. In the COP/MOP-1 decision on  Article 5.2 (adjustments), delegates left open whether a  disagreement between a Party and the expert review team (ERT)  regarding an adjustment should be forwarded to the COP/MOP or only  to the Compliance Committee.

In the draft COP-7 and COP/MOP-1 decisions on guidelines under  Article 7, delegates deferred consideration of issues related to  Article 7.4 (modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts)  and LULUCF, as relevant issues were still being dealt with by  other groups.

Delegates then considered the Article 7 guidelines. On Part I,  Reporting of Supplementary Information under Article 7.1  (inventories), several sections were agreed, however the section  on greenhouse gas inventory information remained bracketed pending  LULUCF outcomes. The section on information on additions to and  subtractions from assigned amounts remained in brackets pending  Article 7.4 outcomes. The section on minimization of adverse  impacts under Article 3.14 (adverse effects) was not agreed, with  SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by JAPAN and others, suggesting that Parties  'shall' rather than 'are requested to' provide information.

Under Part II, Reporting of Supplementary Information under  Article 7.2 (national communications), the section on national  registries was left unresolved pending conclusions from the group  on Article 7.4. AUSTRALIA proposed deleting a bracketed section on  reporting on mechanisms projects, noting that this would be  covered under Article 7.4. Text on joint fulfillment was left in  brackets. SAUDI ARABIA advocated retaining bracketed text  regarding reporting on Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms),  while SAMOA supported retaining text on reporting on national  arrangements to ensure that LULUCF activities contribute to  conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of natural  resources.

Parties then turned to the guidelines for review under Article 8,  beginning with a textual proposal by the EU, Japan and Australia  for the COP/MOP decision, deciding to start the annual review in  the year following the submission of the report. On timing and  procedures under Part I, General Approach to Review, JAPAN  suggested inserting text that addresses review for reinstatement  of eligibility to use mechanisms. On ERTs and institutional  arrangements, informal group Chair Festus Luboyera (South Africa)  reported that most paragraphs had been approved, but that some  additional language was being drafted to address the outstanding  issues, such as on competence of participating experts. Parties  left Part III, Review of Information on Assigned Amounts,  bracketed pending outcomes from consultations. On Part VI, Review  of National Communications and Information on Other Commitments  under the Kyoto Protocol, CHINA requested that the scope of the  review include examination of financial resources separately from  technology transfer.

Drafting groups continued their work on Saturday into the night,  focusing on the outstanding issues referred to them by the  negotiating group. The group on LULUCF considered at length the  issue of reporting on areas of land, without arriving at a final  conclusion.

### COMPLIANCE

Informal consultations took place early Saturday  morning on outstanding issues in the section on the facilitative  branch and resulted in an improved, though not consensual, text.  In the afternoon, the drafting group met to consider this text as  well as other outstanding issues. By the time of Saturday  evening's extended Bureau meeting, progress was reported on, inter  alia, the reference to Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects)  under the enforcement branch and provisions relating to public  access to information. The draft COP decision, the applicable  consequences and the mandates of the branches remained unresolved.

### LDCS

The contact group met in the afternoon to report back on  progress in the drafting groups on guidelines for the preparation  of NAPAs and the establishment of the LDC expert group. Revised  text on both matters has been prepared. Chair Gamede identified  the two outstanding LDC issues: guidance to the LDC Fund; and  status of implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.9 (LDCs). Parties  then considered the guidance to an operating entity of the  financial mechanism of the UNFCCC on the LDC Fund. MALI, for the  LDCs, underscored a simplified operating procedure of the Fund  enabling project approval within four months, and employment of  local and regional expertise. The EU suggested that the legal and  technical review had not taken into account the guidance document  and, with the US, JAPAN, and NORWAY, said that developing guidance  to the Fund should be considered at COP-8. UGANDA underscored the  urgency of the LDCs' concerns. Chair Gamede requested Parties to  consider this informally, and to report back early Monday morning.  If no agreement was reached, he said the matter of guidance to the  Fund would be referred to ministers.

### CGE

A drafting group convened on the CGE, although discussions  did not result in agreement on disputed issues, which remain in  brackets. A revised text will be presented to the contact group on  Monday.

### IPCC TAR

Consultations continued on the implications of the IPCC  Third Assessment Report for the work of the UNFCCC. Progress was  made on the terms of reference for a proposed workshop and further  consultations will be held to finalize these.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

On other issues, Parties completed consultations  relating to UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public  awareness), agreeing, inter alia, on the need for a workshop and  clearinghouse. Relevant conclusions will be forwarded to the  SBSTA.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates ended the first week of COP-7 in a flurry of activity  and intensive negotiations Saturday. The extended Bureau meeting  held on Saturday night to review progress and decide on next steps  was apparently an upbeat and generally positive affair, although  at least one speaker reportedly urged that the goodwill seen in  the Bureau needed to make its presence more apparent when  negotiating and drafting groups resume on Monday.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### NEGOTIATING GROUPS

Negotiating and drafting groups on the  mechanisms, compliance and Articles 5, 7 and 8 will resume their  work, and are expected to focus on the remaining unresolved issues  until 6:00 pm.

### PLENARY

Delegates are expected to convene for a Plenary at 6:00  pm to receive reports on progress in the negotiating groups and to  decide on next steps.
