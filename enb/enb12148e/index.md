# SBI

### COP-7 VENUE

The SBI adopted a draft decision to be  submitted to COP-6 accepting Morocco's offer to host COP-7.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

On implementation of  the headquarters agreement, SBI Chair Ashe recalled  concerns relating to adequate office space and acquiring  visas and work permits. GERMANY said progress had been made  to resolve these issues, and a report will be presented at  COP-6.

On the Secretariat's report on the audited financial report  (1999) and interim financial performance (2000), FCCC  Executive Secretary Cutajar reported that the FCCC and CCD  Secretariats would establish a common administrative  service, and a report would be made available at COP-6. The  SBI agreed to defer consideration of possible options to  respond to late payments of contributions to COP-6.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Participants considered the report  on national greenhouse gas inventory data from Annex I  Parties for 1990-1998. ARGENTINA noted successful measures  undertaken by the UK and Germany to reduce emissions and  highlighted continuing emissions increases in the US. He  said Annex I commitments must be met. The EU expressed  satisfaction with the number of Annex I Parties using the  new reporting format. He noted with concern the continuing  emissions increases in some countries.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

URUGUAY thanked the GEF for its  assistance. On the role of the Consultative Group of  Experts (CGE), KENYA and VANUATU drew attention to the  financial shortfall facing the CGE. The PHILIPPINES said  there had been a waste of resources in relation to the CGE,  and called for a review of its terms of reference. CHINA  urged Annex II countries to provide adequate financial  support to CGE. The US said many Parties regarded the CGE  as a useful group, and supported its activities.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL MEETINGS

### GEF

Parties engaged in an informal question-and-answer  session with the GEF Chair/CEO, Mohamed El-Ashry.  Responding to KENYA's comment on the difficulties in  dealing with the implementing agencies, El-Ashry said the  GEF was trying to improve the responsiveness of the  implementing agencies. He assured delegates that the GEF  would act according to the guidance received from the COP.  On questions about whether the GEF might reconsider its  current focus on mitigation projects in favor of other  areas such as adaptation once the CDM is introduced, El- Ashry noted the limited guidance provided by the COP on  adaptation activities, and added that the specifics of the  CDM had yet to be decided. However, he assured Parties that  the GEF would avoid duplication. El-Ashry said Parties  should communicate their concerns so that any problems can  be addressed.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Delegates met in informal  consultations to consider a proposed draft decision  submitted by the G-77/China containing additional guidance  to the operating entity of the financial mechanism. The  PHILIPPINES, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, outlined the  proposal, aimed at integrating decisions that refer to the  GEF's activities. SBI Chair Ashe said discussions would  continue this week, with a view to elaborating final text  at COP-6.

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Delegates considered text on  elements for a draft decision on 'best practices' in P&Ms.  Text proposed by the US acknowledging completion of the  BAPA requirements on P&Ms was accepted. On continuing  information exchange, delegates discussed revised text  proposed by the US on 'considering ways' to facilitate  cooperation on P&Ms under Article 2.1(b) (cooperation on  P&Ms). The G-77/CHINA proposed bracketing reference to sub- paragraphs 1 and b. VENEZUELA, opposed by the US and  CANADA, included reference to Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse  effects of P&Ms). The G-77/CHINA, opposed by CANADA and  JAPAN, urged limiting the scope of the decision to Annex I  Parties. The EU, opposed by CANADA, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA,  emphasized the establishment of a consultative process to  ensure continuity of information exchange.

On the nature of future activities, CANADA, the US and  JAPAN, opposed by the EU, proposed reference to 'future  work' rather than 'consultative process.' JAPAN and  AUSTRALIA highlighted information exchange on cross- sectoral issues.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Co-Chair Plume distributed  revised draft conclusions, noting that they do not specify  whether separate decisions will be taken at COP-6 on the  guidelines under Articles 5,7 and 8. She highlighted the  proposal that an informal consultation on the matters be  held. On the draft decision text on Article 5.2 for COP-6  and that for COP/MOP-1, SAUDI ARABIA, supported by TUVALU,  PERU, CHINA and BRAZIL, and opposed by the US and NEW  ZEALAND, suggested deleting references to activities under  Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4 at this stage, as outstanding  issues are being considered in the LULUCF group.

Delegates then discussed Part II of the guidelines under  Article 8. SAUDI ARABIA highlighted the G-77/CHINA's  inability to participate fully in discussions, and added  that text should be open for comment later on. Delegates  commented both on structural issues and on more specific  issues, placing brackets on many paragraphs.

### COMPLIANCE

The G-77/CHINA stressed the need for equitable  geographic distribution in the compliance committee. She  proposed text referencing common but differentiated  responsibility and suggested differentiation between Annex  I and non-Annex I Parties. The US, with CANADA, AUSTRALIA  and NEW ZEALAND, suggested that where members from one  branch participate in the work of the other, it be on a  non-voting basis. SAUDI ARABIA, with VENEZUELA, CHINA and  QATAR, said the enforcement branch's mandate should include  determination of whether an Annex I Party is in non- compliance with FCCC Article 3.14 (adverse effects). With  the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and VENEZUELA, but opposed by  CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, he supported text  referencing Protocol Article 18 (non-compliance) in the  establishment of the compliance committee. The EU, with  JAPAN, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and the US,  recommended that the options on the compliance committee's  composition be kept open. With JAPAN and CANADA, she said  the enforcement branch should be able to impose  facilitative consequences. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested  text referencing FCCC Article 4.6 (flexibility for EITs).

### MECHANISMS

Delegates continued discussing the consolidated  text. On the draft decision on the CDM, JAPAN said any  requirements on financial additionality should not result  in diversion of ODA. The US emphasized that revisions to  the modalities, procedures and guidelines be made by  consensus. The G-77/CHINA highlighted the need to  distinguish between additionality and baselines, and  underlined reference to funding additionality. The EU,  opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed that the COP invite the  IPCC to prepare guidelines for baselines. On the COP/MOP  rules, NORWAY and the US emphasized that institutional  responsibilities be part of the COP-6 decision.

On the Executive Board (EB), NORWAY, CANADA, JAPAN and the  US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, highlighted a role for the  EB in determining new baseline and monitoring  methodologies. The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that the EB  has been gaining at the cost of the COP/MOP. On  accreditation, BRAZIL suggested replacing a reference to  the accreditation body with the EB. SAUDI ARABIA  highlighted the COP/MOP as the supreme authority.

On designated operational entities, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA,  opposed by NORWAY, introduced a reference to conflict of  interest. On participation, Parties disagreed on the need  for text relating to: projects proposed, developed,  financed and implemented by non-Annex I countries;  conditions on non-Annex I participation such as the  fulfillment of commitments under FCCC Article 12  (communication of information); and certain eligibility  criteria for transfers and acquisitions under Protocol  Article 3 (commitments).

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The contact group met to consider the  Co-Chairs' draft text on a framework for meaningful and  effective actions to enhance the implementation of FCCC  Article 4.5 (development and transfer of technology).

On Purposes, the G-77/CHINA proposed specifying that the  text shall serve as a framework for implementation of FCCC  Article 4.5 commitments, and stressed that the extent to  which developing countries can implement their commitments  under the FCCC depended on effective participation by  developed countries. SWITZERLAND said it should enhance  implementation of Article 4.5 by increasing the flow of  environmentally-sound technologies.

On the Overall Approach, the G-77/CHINA proposed Agenda 21  language on technology transfer, while the US preferred  language from FCCC Article 4.5. SWITZERLAND objected to a  US proposal to delete the term 'equitable' in describing  the process of technology transfer, given the diversity of  characteristics of developing countries and regions. On  market-driven approaches, EL SALVADOR stressed the need to  reflect the involvement of governments.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Participants met to consider the revised  draft text on FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article  3.14. On text relating to the provision of information by  least developed countries (LDCs) through sources other than  national communications, the G-77/CHINA stressed that many  developing countries had difficulties completing their  national communications, and that other relevant  information should also serve as the basis for determining  their adaptation activities. The EU, supported by the US,  CANADA and JAPAN, stressed the importance of the national  communications process, and highlighted the recognition of  the special needs and circumstances of LDCs in the FCCC.  VANUATU, on behalf of the LDCs, cited marginalization in  the process, and requested that their special needs be  considered. BURKINA FASO underscored the importance of  establishing and strengthening national and regional  institutions for, inter alia, research on climate change  and its adverse effects.

### LULUCF

BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, presented basic  principles for Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4 (additional  activities). He said that, inter alia: activities should  not change the Protocol's global climate change mitigation  effect; forest conservation and rehabilitation of degraded  lands should be recognized as adaptation activities and  receive a share of the mechanisms' proceeds; a transfer of  commitments to a future commitment period should not be  allowed; carbon removed through LULUCF activities shall be  considered temporary; and the simple presence of carbon  stocks in national reservoirs shall not result in credits  in line with Article 5.2.

In response to the presentation, NEW ZEALAND called for  consistency with Protocol language, and said the issue of  share of proceeds for adaptation should be addressed later,  and elsewhere. The US noted that issues of permanence will  be addressed in Annex I countries because of inventory  requirements. BOLIVIA called for an operational link to the  CDM.

Co-Chair Gwage said the principles outlined by the G-77/China would provide the basis for a preamble for a  decision on Article 3.3 and 3.4. The US commented that  several paragraphs of the text addressed Article 12 more  directly than Article 3.3 and 3.4.
