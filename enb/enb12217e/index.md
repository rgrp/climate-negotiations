# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

Delegates considered revised draft  conclusions and decisions. Regarding issues relating to the  implementation of Article 8, Parties agreed draft COP and COP/MOP  decisions, following minor editorial amendments and the addition,  in the annex on criteria for selecting lead reviewers, of a  bracketed paragraph on desirable language skills for lead  reviewers. CHINA and JAPAN agreed to discuss this issue informally,  in order to reach resolution before the SBSTA plenary on Thursday,  12 June.

Parties also agreed Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, and draft COP  and COP/MOP decisions on technical guidance on methodologies for  adjustments under Article 5.2 (adjustments). The contact group  then approved the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions on methodological  issues relating to reporting and review of Annex I greenhouse gas  inventories.

Regarding the draft COP decision on the technical review of  inventories, delegates discussed at length the annex on the code  of practice for the treatment of confidential information. CHINA,  opposed by the US, CANADA, JAPAN, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and EU,  suggested deleting text in the annex that calls on experts to  disclose potential conflicts of interest, noting that this would  create an additional burden on expert reviewers. Following  consultations, delegates agreed to amend the draft decision to  provide that the Agreement on Expert Review Services be based on  the elements outlined in the annex and any additional elements  arising from consideration of consequences for breach of the  agreement. Parties then agreed the draft decision.

### SINKS IN THE CDM

NEW ZEALAND introduced a document on definitions  for modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation  (A&R) projects, which combines Parties' submissions. BOLIVIA said  that countries, rather than the COP, should decide on which carbon  'pools' to include in A&R projects, and that it was important to  include geo-referencing in the draft decision. BOLIVIA also noted  that Parties may want to elaborate sources and sectors listed in  Annex A of the Protocol, as they may want to account for other  sources not already included. The EU said that it preferred a  combined approach to account for carbon stock changes and some  emissions sources. AOSIS said the text on how to define  anthropogenic removals of emissions was ambiguous. COLOMBIA  indicated that carbon pools should be accounted for 'within the  project boundary.' CHINA noted that it needed capacity to  understand technical information associated with the timing for  baselines and actual emissions in projects. He also called for a  way to address zero carbon pools, and suggested simplifying the  concept of baselines. The EU and AOSIS said the proposed  definitions on the 'project boundary' should be amended to  differentiate between boundaries relevant to accounting methods  and those exclusively geographical in nature. CHILE noted that  more than one activity should be included in a LULUCF CDM project.

On project monitoring, BOLIVIA questioned how to estimate and  control leakage, and URUGUAY noted that there is a need to  minimize negative leakage. Parties then considered appendices to  text on definitions and modalities for sinks in the CDM in the  first commitment period. Introducing draft Appendix E on  environmental and socioeconomic impacts of CDM projects, the EU,  NORWAY and SWITZERLAND said this was developed following informal  consultations, and aimed to help countries in preparing CDM  projects. CANADA, with NEW ZEALAND, JAPAN and SENEGAL, expressed  concern over text requiring Parties to address a number of issues  when analyzing environmental impacts. On future work, Co-Chair  Karsten Sach urged Parties to hold informal inter-sessional  consultations and suggested convening pre-sessional consultations  to complete work before COP-9.

### IPCC TAR

Following informal consultations in the afternoon,  Parties met informally in the evening to consider a revised  version of the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions. The draft conclusions  state that SBSTA will establish two new agenda items for regular  consideration on the scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of adaptation, and of mitigation. They also note that  SBSTA will explore, in the context of sustainable development, the  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of cross-cutting  issues noted in the SBSTA-16 report.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Parties discussed the Co-Chairs' draft  conclusions paragraph-by-paragraph. The EU and JAPAN, opposed by  the G-77/CHINA, reiterated their request to delete a sentence  calling for information exchange on ways to minimize the adverse  effects of response measures. Following discussions, the EU  suggested replacing the sentence with a general reference to  decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms). The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU and US,  suggested replacing the sentence and surrounding text with a  specific paragraph from decision 13/CP.7. Following informal  discussions, Co-Chair Greg Terrill proposed new conclusions noting  the continued importance of implementing decision 13/CP.7, and  agreeing to reconsider this agenda item at SBSTA-19. Parties  agreed the draft conclusions.

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Following informal consultations conducted in  the morning, this group convened briefly to consider and agree  outstanding text on the comprehensive review's terms of reference.  Parties then agreed to the whole text including the draft  conclusions proposed by the Chair.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET

Delegates in this contact group exchanged views  on the UNFCCC conference services contingency and the Chair's  revised draft conclusions. The G-77/CHINA asked whether the UN  General Assembly's (UNGA) recent decision to fund UNFCCC  conference services from the UN regular budget would be applied  until 2006. JAPAN said the new UNGA scale of assessment should be  applied. Stressing that adaptation is of greater concern to  Central American countries than mitigation, HONDURAS noted its  concern about the amount of funding budgeted for CDM activities.  Parties then deliberated on the six options outlined in the draft  conclusions, unable to remove any of them. The UNFCCC Executive  Secretary noted that existing funds would only support activities  until February 2004.

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND

The G-77/CHINA presented its  amendments to the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, stating that the  Group's overriding interest is that a decision on the SCCF be  taken at COP-9. Opposed by the EU and CANADA, he said that the G-77/China's text should serve as the basis for negotiation. Co- Chair Rawleston Moore adjourned the meeting for an informal  consultation on this issue. Upon reconvening, Co-Chair Moore said  that the annex would be removed from the draft conclusions, and  that the G-77/China's paper would be listed in a MISC document.

Delegates then discussed the prioritization of the SCCF's  activities as outlined in the draft conclusions. CANADA, with the  EU, NORWAY and JAPAN, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed that  the SCCF support adaptation and mitigation activities. ARGENTINA,  supported by the G-77/CHINA and others, said that adaptation  projects are of global benefit and should be given the highest  priority under the SCCF. GHANA suggested that the SCCF provide  resources to non-Annex I Parties not identified as LDCs to enable  them to prepare their adaptation plans and strategies. He also  proposed that small-scale projects, including pilot and  demonstration activities, should have expedited access to the SCCF.  In response to Ghana's proposal, UGANDA and CANADA said these  elements provide operational guidance and should not be included  in the draft conclusions. ARGENTINA, opposed by the EU and others,  proposed that the SCCF be used to finance activities that are  complementary to those funded by the climate change focal areas of  the GEF, the LDC Fund, and bilateral and multilateral sources.  Delegates could not agree to an EU proposal, supported by CANADA  and NORWAY, that the SBI invite the GEF to submit its views on  complementarity among the funds under the UNFCCC. Delegates agreed  to delete text requesting further submission of views and calling  for inter-sessional informal consultation on the SCCF prior to  SBI-19.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

This group met to continue considering  the Co-Chair's proposed draft conclusions, which had been revised  to include proposals by the G-77/CHINA and EU. Delegates discussed  the options and their placement in the draft conclusions.

The G-77/CHINA proposed a new paragraph requesting the Secretariat  to compile a synthesis report on information regarding the  specific needs and concerns of developing countries arising from  the adverse effects of climate change and response measures, and  the support required to address these. AUSTRALIA, CANADA, NEW  ZEALAND and the US proposed alternative text listing activities  relating to the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 (Article 4.8 and  4.9) to reflect that progress had been made. The G-77/CHINA said  that this was an unrelated proposal that did not constitute  alternative text.

On the outcomes of the modeling workshop, AOSIS proposed a  paragraph calling on SBSTA to note the need to improve support for  capacity building to developing country experts and to increase  their participation in the modeling process. The G-77/CHINA  maintained its support for text on actions relating to the  workshop's results that could be recommended by the SBI and SBSTA.  The EU favored text noting that SBI-18 had considered the  workshop's outcomes. The G-77/CHINA proposed text on the outcomes  of the workshops on insurance and risk assessment and on related  actions, which the EU and US opposed, stating that the reports  were not available for consideration at SBI-18.

Regarding the workshops on insurance and risk assessment, AOSIS  proposed text calling on the SBI to invite further views from  Parties on the workshop outcomes for consideration by the COP with  the aim of agreeing a decision. The US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW  ZEALAND supported the invitation for views but said the SBI should  not prejudge the outcome of the COP's deliberations.

After a break to allow the Secretariat to revise the text,  delegates could not agree to delete some of the options. The EU,  US, AUSTRALIA and AOSIS expressed disappointment over the lack of  agreement and proposed that the draft conclusions include  paragraphs on which there was some agreement. The G-77/CHINA  preferred to state in the conclusions that there was no agreement,  or transmit the bracketed text to SBI-19. After brief  consultations with the delegates, Co-Chair Robert Mason reported  that there was a willingness to try and agree on some text and  said consultations would continue on Thursday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some delegates were concerned about the slow progress in  Wednesday's discussions, particularly on the Secretariat's  proposed budget, noting that the draft decision text currently  includes six options. One observer said that budget negotiations  seemed to be about 'principles' rather than 'practicalities.' She  also remarked that the UNGA resolution on conference servicing  would at most provide the UNFCCC with funding from the UN regular  budget for administrative services.
