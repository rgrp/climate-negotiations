abstract: "The eighth Conference of the Parties (COP-8) to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the  seventeenth sessions of the COP's Subsidiary Body for  Implementation (SBI) and Subsidiary Body for Scientific and  Technological Advice (SBSTA) were held at the Vigyan Bhawan  Conference Centre in New Delhi, India, from 23 October to 1  November 2002. Over 4300 participants from 167 Parties, 3 observer  States, 213 intergovernmental, non-governmental and other observer  organizations, and 222 media outlets were in attendance. This was  the first COP since November 2001, when delegates completed three  years of negotiations on the operational details of the Kyoto  Protocol and adopted the Marrakesh Accords to the Bonn Agreements.  The meeting marked a new phase of negotiations focused on  implementation of the Marrakesh Accords and UNFCCC issues."
---

Throughout the meeting, Parties convened in negotiating groups,  informal consultations, and plenary sessions of the SBI, SBSTA and  COP in an attempt to adopt decisions and conclusions on a number  of issues previously left off the agenda due to the pressing  negotiations under the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Among other  things, Parties took up and adopted decisions and conclusions on:  the improved guidelines for non-Annex I national communications;  several issues under the financial mechanism; 'good practices' in  policies and measures; research and systematic observation;  cooperation with relevant international organizations; and  methodological issues. Three ministerial high-level round table  discussions were held on Wednesday and Thursday, 30-31 October, to  discuss 'Taking Stock,' 'Climate Change and Sustainable  Development,' and 'Wrap Up.' On the final day, Parties adopted the  Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainable Development.

The usual division between developed and developing country  positions on many issues was in evidence at COP-8. Many countries  had hoped that the developed/developing country dichotomy would  break down, exposing the variety of interests within non-Annex I  countries. This would have facilitated the adoption of a Delhi  Declaration initiating a dialogue on broadening commitments, in  accordance with the stated positions of Annex I countries. Instead,  the voice of non-Annex I countries in favor of such a declaration  was drowned by calls from more powerful developing countries in  favor of a declaration focusing on adaptation. The Delhi  Declaration reaffirms development and poverty eradication as  overriding priorities in developing countries and implementation  of UNFCCC commitments according to Parties' common but  differentiated responsibilities, development priorities and  circumstances. It does not call for a dialogue on broadening  commitments.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  the world's environment, with negative impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth's atmosphere  are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed. Despite some lingering  uncertainties, the majority of scientists believe that prompt and  precautionary action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Adopted in  1992, the UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at  stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to  avoid 'dangerous interference' with the climate system. The  greenhouse gases to be limited include methane, nitrous oxide, and,  in particular, carbon dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21  March 1994. It now has 187 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, and gave it the task of reaching agreement on  strengthening efforts to combat climate change. Following intense  negotiations culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December  1997, delegates agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits  developed countries and countries making the transition to a  market economy to achieve quantified emission reduction targets.  These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, are to  reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least  5% from 1990 levels by 2008 to 2012 (the first commitment period),  with specific targets varying from country to country. The  Protocol also established three mechanisms to assist Annex I  Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively - an  emissions trading system, joint implementation (JI) of emissions- reduction projects between Annex I Parties, and a Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM) to encourage projects in non-Annex I  (developing country) Parties.

It was left for subsequent meetings to decide on most of the rules  and operational details that determine how these cuts in emissions  will be achieved and how countries' efforts will be measured and  assessed. To enter into force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55  Parties to the UNFCCC, including Annex I Parties representing at  least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990. To date,  96 Parties have ratified the Protocol, including 26 Annex I  Parties, representing a total of 37.4% of total carbon dioxide  emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

At COP-4, which met in Buenos  Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, Parties set a schedule for  reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and  the strengthening of the UNFCCC's implementation. In a decision  known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA), delegates agreed  that the deadline for reaching agreement should be COP-6. Critical  Protocol-related issues needing resolution included rules relating  to the flexibility mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties'  compliance, and accounting methods for national emissions and  emissions reductions. Rules on crediting countries for carbon  sinks were also to be addressed. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the Netherlands,  from 13-25 November 2000. Political positions on the key issues  remained entrenched, with little indication of willingness to  compromise. During the second week of negotiations, COP-6  President Jan Pronk (the Netherlands) attempted to facilitate  negotiations on the many disputed political and technical issues  by convening high-level informal plenary sessions. He grouped the  issues into four 'clusters' or 'boxes': (a) capacity building,  technology transfer, adverse effects and guidance to the financial  mechanism; (b) mechanisms; (c) LULUCF; and, (d) compliance, P&Ms,  and accounting, reporting and review under Protocol Articles 5 ,7  and 8. After almost 36 hours of intense talks in the final two  days, negotiators could not achieve an agreement, with financial  issues, supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance  and LULUCF proving particularly difficult. On Saturday afternoon,  25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates had failed  to reach agreement. Parties agreed to suspend COP-6, and expressed  a willingness to resume in 2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  Kyoto Protocol, stating that it considered the Protocol to be  'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempt  developing countries from emission reductions. Parties then  reconvened at COP-6 Part II and the fourteenth sessions of the  subsidiary bodies, which met in Bonn, Germany, from 16-27 July  2001. After protracted consultations, President Pronk presented  his proposal for a draft political decision. Several Parties  announced that they could support the political decision, but  disagreements surfaced over the nature of the compliance regime.  After several days of consultations, ministers finally agreed to  adopt the original political decision, with a revised section on  compliance. The political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - was  formally adopted by the COP on 25 July 2001.

Although draft decisions were approved on a number of key issues,  no agreement was reached on decisions regarding the mechanisms,  compliance and LULUCF. Since not all texts in the 'package' of  decisions were completed, all draft decisions were forwarded to  COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates met for COP-7 and the fifteenth sessions of the  subsidiary bodies in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10  November 2001. The main goal was to complete the tasks left  unfinished at COP-6 Parts I and II, thereby bringing to a close  three years of negotiations under the Buenos Aires Plan of Action.  The Bonn Agreements served as the basis for negotiation.

After protracted bilateral and multilateral talks, a package deal  on LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, and an input  to the WSSD was proposed on Thursday evening, 8 November. Although  the deal was accepted by most regional groups, including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose alliance of Annex  I Parties that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and  the Russian Federation) did not join the consensus. They disputed,  among other things, eligibility requirements and bankability under  the mechanisms. However, following extensive negotiations, the  Marrakesh Accords were agreed, with key features including  consideration of LULUCF Principles and limited banking of units  generated by sinks under the CDM.

### SB-16

Parties met for the sixteenth sessions of the subsidiary  bodies from 5-14 June 2002, in Bonn. The meeting considered a  range of issues previously left off the agenda due to the pressing  BAPA negotiations. Views on the direction of the climate process  varied greatly, with some Parties looking backward to recent  debates and others looking ahead toward the next commitment period.  Many expressed their hope that the Protocol would enter into force  by the August 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD),  with the EU and Japan announcing their ratifications just prior to  SB-16. Several draft decisions were agreed and forwarded to COP-8.

### WSSD

From 26 August to 4 September 2002, the WSSD was held in  Johannesburg, South Africa. The WSSD adopted text identifying the  UNFCCC as the 'key' instrument for addressing climate change,  reaffirming the UNFCCC's ultimate objective, and emphasizing the  importance of developing cleaner technologies in sectors such as  energy. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation also makes  reference to the timely ratification of the Protocol by those  States who have not yet done so. Delegates agreed to further text  identifying actions to address climate change, such as providing  technical and financial assistance to developing countries, and  countries with economies in transition.

# COP-8 REPORT

On Wednesday morning, 23 October, COP-7 President Mohamed Elyazghi  (Morocco) opened COP-8. He drew attention to the Marrakesh Accords,  noting that the focus of the process has shifted to implementation.

The COP then elected T. R. Baalu, Indian Minister of Environment  and Forests, as COP-8 President by acclamation. COP-8 President  Baalu welcomed participants, noting that the impacts of climate  change are already being felt. He stressed implementation, and  highlighted the need for adaptation. He said that a consensus- based Delhi Declaration addressing climate change and sustainable  development would be an important outcome of COP-8.

In her address, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter  stressed the linkage between poverty and environment made at the  WSSD. She said the Secretariat would host authoritative databases  of emissions, and of policies and measures (P&Ms) to facilitate  information exchange between Parties.

The Secretariat noted that 185 States and one regional  organization have ratified the UNFCCC. He said Afghanistan had  deposited its instrument of ratification on 19 September 2002,  bringing the total number of Parties to 187.

On the provisional agenda (FCCC/CP/2002/1, Add.1 and Add.2), the  G-77/China urged excluding Canada's proposal for a decision on  modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts under Protocol  Article 7.4 (registries) in relation to cleaner energy exports.  Canada emphasized the cleaner energy proposal as a priority for  the future success of the Protocol. The EU opposed Saudi Arabia's  request to include discussions on the implementation of Protocol  Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms) on the agenda. Saudi Arabia  said the issue was unfinished business from the BAPA and stressed  preparation of a draft decision for COP/MOP-1. The agenda was  adopted with these items and the issue of the second review of the  adequacy of commitments held in abeyance.

President Baalu noted that consultations would continue on the  election of officers other than the President. On Friday, 1  November, COP-8 President Baalu noted that officers had been  elected and invited Parties to approve the elections by  acclamation. The officers elected include Daniela Stoytcheva  (Bulgaria) for SBI Chair, HalldÃ³r Thorgeirsson (Iceland) for SBSTA  Chair, and Gonzalo MenÃ©ndez (Panama) for Rapporteur. The other  officers come from Burkina Faso, Chile, Germany, Morocco, Qatar,  the Russian Federation and Tuvalu.

In an opening statement, the G-77/China expressed disappointment  at the low level of financial resources provided by Annex I  Parties, stressing that action so far has been symbolic. Supported  by the Umbrella Group, he underscored the importance of linking  sustainable development and climate change. Stressing the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, China  said the climate regime should take into account the rising energy  demands that will occur as the quality of life in developing  countries improves. Zimbabwe, for the Africa Group, called for  increased support for adaptation projects.

The COP met in plenary sessions on Wednesday, 23 October, Friday,  25 October, and twice on Friday, 1 November. A high-level segment  took place on Wednesday and Thursday, 30-31 October, and included  round table discussions. The SBSTA held its opening session on  Wednesday, 23 October. It also met in sessions on Thursday, 24  October, Friday 25 October, and held its final meeting on Tuesday,  29 October. The SBI opened on Wednesday, 23 October. It met on  Thursday, 24 October, Friday, 25 October, late night on Tuesday,  29 October, Thursday, 31 October and closed on Friday, 1 November.  This report summarizes the issues discussed at the meeting,  organized in accordance with the agendas of the SBSTA, SBI and COP.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

SBSTA Chair HalldÃ³r Thorgeirsson (Iceland) opened the seventeenth  session on Wednesday afternoon, 23 October. Noting that the SBSTA  Vice-Chair had resigned, he said a replacement nomination was  expected from GRULAC. He also said Tatyana Osokova (Uzbekistan)  would serve as Rapporteur. The SBSTA adopted the provisional  agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/7). The SBSTA met for four days,  established numerous contact groups and adopted its conclusions  and draft decisions on Tuesday, 29 October. All conclusions and  draft decisions were forwarded to the COP for adoption on Friday,  1 November.

### THIRD ASSESSMENT REPORT (TAR) OF THE IPCC

On 24 October, the EU,  opposed by the US and the G-77/China, proposed an agenda item on  the methodological issues relating to the stabilization of  greenhouse gas emissions. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would prepare  conclusions. On 29 October, Parties adopted the conclusions with  minor amendments.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.20) note  that SBSTA considers the possible implications of the TAR for its  work and would consider the TAR further at SBSTA-18.

METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES - Review of Methodological Work under the  UNFCCC and Protocol: This issue was considered twice in the SBSTA  and numerous times in informal consultations. The Secretariat  introduced a report on this new SBSTA agenda item during the  opening session on Wednesday, 23 October, highlighting five  priority topics related to greenhouse gas inventories, emissions  and removals by sinks, P&Ms, mitigation and adaptation  technologies, and impacts, vulnerability and adaptation of climate  change. The EU, Norway, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand supported  consideration of the item beyond SBSTA-17. The US cautioned  against the Secretariat moving beyond its mandate in initiating  work.

Harald Dovland (Norway) undertook informal consultations. In SBSTA  Plenary on Tuesday, 29 October, he presented draft conclusions.  China said he had not been able to take part in the consultations  and proposed several substantive amendments. A revised text was  agreed at the end of the meeting, following informal consultations.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions, (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.17)  SBSTA:supports a strategic approach to future methodological work; invites Parties to submit their views in this regard; invites the IPCC to revise the guidelines for national  greenhouse gas inventories; requests the Secretariat to provide information on  methodologies for the estimation of emissions and removals by sinks;  and decides to continue consideration of this agenda item in  future SBSTA sessions.

###     Guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8

Delegates took up  issues related to Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information) in  the SBSTA opening session on Wednesday, 23 October. A contact  group was convened under Co-Chairs Helen Plume (New Zealand) and  Festus Luboyera (South Africa). The group met in three formal  sessions to take stock and agree on text negotiated during  informal sessions. On Tuesday, 29 October, the SBSTA Plenary  adopted conclusions and COP draft decisions.

At the first SBSTA Plenary, on Wednesday, 23 October, Chair  Thorgeirsson highlighted outstanding issues to be addressed,  including: options for the treatment of confidential data during  review; training and capacity building for expert review teams;  technical standards for data exchange between national registries,  the CDM registry and the transaction log; and reporting and review  of information on assigned amounts and national registries. The EU  welcomed progress on options for the terms of service for lead  reviewers and the training of experts. Saudi Arabia said training  of review experts should include developing country experts. The  US stressed the importance of options for the treatment of  confidential data and encouraged transparency of inventory data.

On technical standards for registries under Article 7.4  (registries), Murray Ward (New Zealand) reported on the outcome of  intersessional consultations. He outlined agreement on: the need  for a common standards framework; the need to engage technical  experts; and a future focus on detailed registry design.

In the first contact group meeting on 23 October, delegates  discussed the timing for expedited review procedures for  reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms. The EU  circulated a paper on preventing and resolving technical problems  and discrepancies in the technical standards and reporting and  review text. Delegates considered and endorsed a proposal for case  studies on the calculation of adjustments under Article 5.2  (adjustments). Turning to the training of experts in review teams,  the Secretariat highlighted plans for a pilot training programme.  On the treatment of confidential data, delegates exchanged  preliminary views, and decided to forward the issue to SBSTA-18.

At the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 29 October, Co-Chair Plume  reported that the contact group had completed its work, bringing  three years of negotiations on this issue to a close. Murray Ward  reported on informal consultations on guidelines under Article 7.4.  Conclusions and draft decision were adopted.

On Saturday, 26 October, the contact group addressed the pending  sections of the Article 7 and 8 guidelines. Informal discussions  continued throughout Saturday and Monday, 28 October. Monday  evening the entire text was agreed in the contact group, following  editorial changes by the EU, G-77/China and New Zealand.

The COP also adopted a draft decision forwarded by SBSTA-16 on  demonstrable progress.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and COP Draft Decisions

In the conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.15), the SBSTA, inter alia: decides to consider,  at its eighteenth session, the criteria for review experts and  ways to ensure their competence; requests the Secretariat to  organize training on inventory review and prepare a proposal on a  training programme; and requests the Secretariat to undertake case  studies on adjustment.

The COP draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.15/Add.1) contains the  remaining parts to be incorporated into the guidelines under  Articles 7 and 8, including sections on:reporting of supplementary information under Article 7.1  (information on emission reduction units (ERUs), certified  emissions reductions (CERs), assigned amount units (AAUs) and  removal units (RMUs)) and Article 7.2 (national registries); review of information on assigned amounts pursuant to Article  3.7 and 3.8, ERUs, CERs, AAUs and RMUs; review of national registries; and expedited procedures for the review of reinstatement of  eligibility to use the mechanisms.

The COP draft decision on terms of service for lead reviewers  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.15/Add.2) contains a draft COP/MOP-1 decision  on the terms of service.

Another COP draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.15/Add.3) contains  the technical standards for data exchange between registry systems  under the Protocol.

The decision on demonstrable progress (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.6)  elaborates on the report to be submitted by 1 January 2006, and  requests the Secretariat to provide a synthesis of the submissions.

###     Guidelines on Reporting and Review of Greenhouse Gas Inventories

Delegates considered this agenda item in the SBSTA Plenary on  Wednesday, 23 October. The Secretariat reported on the latest  national greenhouse gas inventory data from Annex I Parties for  1990 to 2000, noting that greenhouse gas emissions and removals  data is available from 39 out of 40 Annex I Parties. The final  SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 29 October, adopted conclusions without  amendments.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.16) take  note of the latest inventory data, information on training of  experts and Party views on treatment of confidential data, and  decide to consider these issues further at SBSTA-18.

###     Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ)

SBSTA considered a report on  AIJ on Thursday, 24 October. The Secretariat noted five new AIJ  projects, with three in Africa, bringing the total number of  projects to 157. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would prepare draft  conclusions.On Tuesday, 29 October, the SBSTA approved the draft  conclusions.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and COP Draft Decision

In the conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.21), the SBSTA notes that it considered the  sixth AIJ synthesis report and recommends a draft decision to the  COP for adoption.

In the draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.21/Add.1) the SBSTA:acknowledges that AIJ activities provide a learning-by-doing  opportunity; decides to continue the pilot phase, and to change the  frequency of the synthesis report to biannually; requests that the Secretariat submit updated information to  SBSTA and SBI; and decides that the reports must be submitted by 1 June 2004.

Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) - Definitions and  modalities for including afforestation and reforestation  activities under Protocol Article 12 (CDM): Parties addressed the  item of LULUCF under the CDM in the SBSTA Plenary and in three  meetings of a contact group, co-chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil)  and Karsten Sach (Germany).

In SBSTA, on Thursday, 24 October, the Food and Agriculture  Organization of the UN (FAO) reported on a recent workshop  regarding forest-related definitions. Malaysia stressed ensuring  the environmental integrity of CDM projects. Brazil supported  developing 'a common language.' Opposing Canada's SBSTA-16  proposal to change the baseline from 1989 to 1999, the EU stressed  its support for the definitions set out in the Marrakesh Accords.  Colombia said the 1989 baseline could impede projects. AOSIS  stressed the need for social and environmental project impact  assessments.

The contact group discussed procedural matters at its first  meeting, on Thursday, 24 October. Delegates agreed to focus on  technical issues. On Friday, 25 October, the contact group  addressed issues of non-permanence. The G-77/China delivered a  proposal that focused on principles, elements, and issues cutting  across non-permanence. The EU proposed a system for accounting  that relies on Temporary Certified Emissions Reduction Units  (TCERs). On Saturday, 26 October, contact group Co-Chair Krug  invited Parties to consider the definition of additionality. The  G-77/China supported the EU's principles on additionality and said  it should be considered on a project-by-project basis. The EU  stressed the importance of 'true' additionality. Canada, with  Norway, supported maintaining the existing definition of  additionality. On leakage, the EU expressed concern about  measuring leakage from activity displacement. The G-77/China noted  that leakage had both positive and negative impacts.

On Monday, 28 October, the contact group continued discussions on  socioeconomic and environmental impacts. Switzerland highlighted  biodiversity concerns. New Zealand drew attention to displacement  from other types of CDM activities. Tuvalu proposed developing a  checklist of socioeconomic and environmental project criteria.  Several Parties stressed that host countries should define such  criteria. On uncertainties, Canada, the EU and Uruguay supported  the Marrakesh Accords. Uruguay noted the need to separate  uncertainty from risk.

On crediting and project lifetime, the EU, supported by a number  of Parties, argued for long-term crediting. Colombia, Paraguay and  Chile said projects should be considered on a case-by-case basis.  Tuvalu noted the problem of project crediting beyond the first  commitment period. Brazil stressed limiting the crediting to up to  20 years. Colombia, with Uruguay, Bolivia and Chile, called for  small-scale sinks projects. The group forwarded draft conclusions  to the SBSTA, which were adopted on Tuesday, 29 October.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.22), note,  inter alia, an options paper on sinks under the CDM to be prepared  by the Secretariat and a workshop to be held in February 2003.

###     Scientific and Methodological Aspects of the Brazilian Proposal

The Brazilian proposal to set differentiated emission reduction  targets for Parties according to the impact of their historic  emissions on temperature rise was addressed in the SBSTA and in  several informal consultations facilitated by Murray Ward (New  Zealand) and Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil). On Thursday, 24 October,  the Secretariat highlighted a recent expert meeting held in  Bracknell, UK (25-27 September). Opposed by Saudi Arabia and  supported by Mexico and the EU, Brazil recommended renewing  SBSTA's mandate on this issue. The US, Canada and Australia  expressed concern regarding the lack of rigorous research on  contributions to climate change. On Tuesday, 29 October, Ward  reported outcomes of the informal consultations to the SBSTA,  which subsequently adopted conclusions.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/ 2002/L.24),  SBSTA agrees to continue supporting the work to a standard  consistent with peer-review; invites the scientific community,  including the IPCC, to participate and share information on future  work on the proposal; and decides to review the work at SBSTA-23.

###     Special Circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6

On  Wednesday, 23 October, Croatia introduced a new technical paper on  a new base year for its emissions estimates under Article 4.6  (special circumstances of economies in transition). Yugoslavia,  opposed by the EU, said it could not support Croatia's proposal.  Chair Thorgeirsson asked Jim Penman (UK) to convene an informal  contact group. At the final SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 29 October,  Chair Penman reported on the outcomes.  SBSTA Conclusions: SBSTA adopted conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.14), which note that the procedure used by  Croatia to estimate its base year emissions is neither consistent  with IPCC good practice guidance, nor with UNFCCC reporting  guidelines, and agreed to forward these conclusions to the SBI.

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

This issue was taken up  in the opening SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday, 23 October, and in  informal consultations led by Terry Carrington (UK) and Philip  Gwage (Uganda) throughout the week. On Wednesday, 23 October,  SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted the annual progress report on  the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) and the report on  the implementation of activities under decision 4/CP.7 (technology  transfer). SBSTA elected William Bonsu (Ghana) and Richard Bradley  (US) as EGTT Chair and Vice-Chair, respectively. Suggesting that  technology transfer to developing countries has been ineffective,  the G-77/China urged additional assistance for both mitigation and  adaptation. India supported consideration of access to resources,  institutional capacity building, and business community  participation. In the SBSTA Plenary on Tuesday, 29 October,  delegates adopted conclusions and approved a draft COP-8 decision.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and COP Draft Decision

The SBSTA conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.29), inter alia, urge developed country Parties  to continue to provide support to developing country Parties, note  several initiatives on technology transfer, and request the  Secretariat to prepare technical papers and organize a workshop on  enabling environments for technology transfer.

The COP draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.29/Add.1) requests the  SBSTA Chair to conduct consultations and ensure collaboration  among expert groups on the cross-cutting issues of their work  programmes, including issues relating to technology transfer and  capacity building; and calls on SBSTA-19 to consider innovative  ways to address outcomes of the technology needs assessments under  the EGTT work programme.

### RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EFFORTS TO PROTECT THE STRATOSPHERIC OZONE  LAYER AND EFFORTS TO SAFEGUARD THE GLOBAL CLIMATE SYSTEM - ISSUES  RELATING TO HYDROFLUOROCARBONS AND PERFLUOROCARBONS

Delegates  addressed this issue in the SBSTA twice. On Thursday, 24 October,  the IPCC and the Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP)  of the Montreal Protocol reported on the development of a Special  Report on practices and technologies to assist Parties with issues  relating to alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. Many  Parties supported a single integrated report to be completed by  COP-11. Australia stressed that future work should be policy  neutral, not prescriptive. Richard Bradley (US) conducted  consultations on draft SBSTA conclusions and a draft COP decision.  On Tuesday, 29 October, Bradley reported back to the SBSTA. The  SBSTA adopted the conclusions and agreed to forward a draft  decision to the COP. The COP adopted the decision on Friday, 1  November.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and COP Draft Decision

The SBSTA conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.19) note that the responses of the IPCC and  TEAP fully address the modalities, feasibility, resource  implications, and timing for providing balanced scientific and  technical information.

The COP draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.19/Add.1) requests the  Secretariat to bring the decision to the attention of the IPCC and  Montreal Protocol Meeting of the Parties, and decides that the  issue will be considered under the agenda item 'Cooperation with  relevant international organizations' upon receipt of the  acceptance by the IPCC and TEAP.

### 'GOOD PRACTICES' IN POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&MS) AMONG ANNEX I  PARTIES

On Thursday, 24 October, Chair Thorgeirsson reported on  intersessional consultations, noting agreement that future steps  should include strengthening web-based approaches for information  exchange and further work on developing and sharing self- evaluations of P&Ms. A contact group co-chaired by Peer Stiansen  (Norway) and Suk-Hoon Woo (Republic of Korea) was convened in the  afternoon. Several developing country Parties objected to  voluntary information exchange on non-Annex I P&Ms, and expressed  concern at the lack of information presently available on adverse  effects. Parties agreed on the need for further work on assessment  methodologies.

On Saturday, 26 October, Co-Chair Stiansen introduced a draft  decision. Several Parties advocated using it as a basis for  discussion. Saudi Arabia said that the G-77/China had not had  enough time to consider the text fully, and could not accept it as  a basis for discussion. Co-Chair Stiansen said he would hold  informal consultations.

On Monday, 28 October, the G-77/China said that there could be no  progress on P&Ms until there was progress on other issues. Co- Chair Stiansen said SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson would hold informal  consultations on a range of issues, including P&Ms.

On Tuesday, 29 October, Co-Chair Woo reported to the SBSTA Plenary,  noting that the group was unable to reach consensus. SBSTA Chair  Thorgeirsson said that informal consultations on this issue were  also unsuccessful. He introduced draft conclusions that took note  of the oral report and other documents under consideration. Saudi  Arabia proposed replacing all paragraphs with text noting only  that SBSTA agreed to continue consideration of the issue at SBSTA- 18. The EU proposed making reference to the implementation of  decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms). The conclusions were adopted as amended.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.28) state  Parties' agreement to consider the issue further at SBSTA-18.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

On Thursday, 24 October,  SBSTA heard presentations and research updates by the World  Climate Research Programme, the International Geosphere-Biosphere  Programme, the International Human Dimensions Programme and the  Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Parties exchanged views on  priority research topics, with Chair Thorgeirsson noting  convergence on: impacts, vulnerability and adaptation; adaptive  capacity and adaptation options; risk assessment and management;  resource management in the context of climate change; ways to deal  with uncertainty; and stabilization pathways. On systematic  observation, he noted support for a voluntary donor fund for GCOS  proposed by Australia. A contact group was convened under the  facilitation of Co-Chairs Sue Barrell (Australia) and S.K.  Srivastav (India).

In the contact group meeting on Thursday, 24 October, discussion  focused on the importance of funding to achieve improvement in  systematic observation systems.

On the draft conclusions, China, supported by Japan, India,  Malaysia and Botswana, highlighted the importance of building  endogenous capacity in developing countries. Canada, with the EU  and US, opposed text inviting the SBI to provide guidance to the  financial mechanism in relation to decision 5/CP.5 (R&SO) and  5/CP.7 (adverse effects). The EU, Norway, Switzerland, China and  AOSIS, opposed by the US, Japan and India, supported a sub- paragraph proposed by the Russian Federation referencing research  priorities in support of the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC.

The group met Monday evening, 28 October, to consider key issues  emerging from a special side event on research, involving  representatives of the SBSTA, the IPCC and several international  research programmes. On a new paragraph noting the need for a more  coordinated research approach to address cross-cutting issues,  India, Malaysia and China, opposed by the EU, Russian Federation,  Norway and Switzerland, proposed deleting reference to the  stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations.

The SBSTA Plenary adopted the conclusions on Tuesday, 29 October.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.27) note the  statements by GCOS and international research programmes. The  conclusions also:welcome the exchange during the special side event; recognize main issues emerging from it and note the need for  a more coordinated approach to cross-cutting issues; decide to consider the need to support developing country  research and systematic observation; decide to regularly consider research issues; request the Secretariat to organize consultations on the  second adequacy report of the global climate observation system;  and note a proposal for a voluntary GCOS fund.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

On Friday,  25 October, the Secretariat presented a scoping paper on cross- cutting thematic areas under the UNFCCC, the United Nations  Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and Convention on  Biodiversity (CBD). Parties diverged on the terms of reference for  a workshop. An informal contact group, co-chaired by Jimena Nieto  (Colombia) and Outi BerghÃ¤ll (Finland), was convened.

On Tuesday, 29 October, Co-Chair Nieto reported on consultations  and SBSTA adopted draft conclusions.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and COP Draft Decision

SBSTA conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA2002/L.18) note the terms of reference for a workshop.  The draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA2002/L.18/Add.1) requests SBSTA to  enhance cooperation with subsidiary bodies of the UNCCD and CBD,  and urges the Joint Liaison Group of the convention secretariats  to enhance the coordination between the UNFCCC, UNCCD and CBD.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Article 6 (education, training and public  awareness) was addressed in the opening SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday,  23 October, and in a contact group co-chaired by Fatu Gaye (Gambia)  and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium). The contact group met  twice formally and held further informal consultations.

On Friday, 25 October, the contact group discussed designating an  international climate change day and the role of NGOs in reporting  on the implementation of the work programme. On Monday, 28 October,  the contact group bracketed all text related to financial  resources and the provision of additional guidance to the  financial mechanism. Unable to reach agreement, Co-Chair van  Ypersele requested Parties to meet informally.

In the final COP Plenary on Friday, 1 November, Namibia, supported  by Senegal, Gambia and Canada, proposed renaming the work  programme the 'New Delhi Work Programme.' SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson  noted that in future sessions, this agenda item would be addressed  as a standing item under the SBI.  SBSTA Conclusions and COP Draft Decision: The conclusions  (FCCC/CP/2002/L.23) note that, rather than designating an  international climate change day, Parties might wish to organize a  climate change awareness day at the national level, and request  the Secretariat to continue to explore with other UN bodies the  possibility of incorporating climate change as an areas of focus  in one of the 41 theme days observed annually within the UN system.  The conclusions also request the Secretariat to prepare a report  on the possible options for increasing the participation of youth  and other groups in the COP.

The decision on the New Delhi Work Programme  (FCCC/CP/2002/L.23/Add.1) recommends adopting a five-year work  programme on Article 6 and undertaking a review of the work  programme in 2007, with an intermediate review of progress in 2004.  It also requests the GEF to provide financial resources to Parties  not included in Annex I, in particular the LDCs and small island  developing States.

OTHER MATTERS - Issues Relating to Cleaner or Less Greenhouse Gas- emitting Energy: On Friday, 25 October, Canada introduced draft  decision text supported by New Zealand, Poland, the Russian  Federation and Slovenia, and opposed by G-77/ China, Switzerland,  and the US. The text requests the Secretariat to ask competent  organizations to analyze the role of trade in cleaner energy in  meeting the objective of the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and to  report back to SBSTA-21. The EU and other Parties reaffirmed their  objection to Canada's original proposal on accounting for cleaner  energy exports. The EU said that only generic issues relating to  trade in cleaner energy should be discussed. Chair Thorgeirsson  said he would undertake consultations on this issue.

On Tuesday, 29 October, Chair Thorgeirsson said consultations had  been unsuccessful.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.25) state  Parties' agreement to consider the issue further at SBSTA-18.

###     Issues Relating to Implementation of Protocol Article 2.3

On  Friday, 25 October, Parties discussed issues relating to possible  workshops. Saudi Arabia argued for a draft decision requesting the  Secretariat to analyze the adverse effects of P&Ms on developing  countries. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would undertake  consultations on this issue.

On Tuesday, 29 October, Chair Thorgeirsson reported that  consultations had been unsuccessful.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/ SBSTA/2002/L.26) state  Parties' agreement to consider the issue further at SBSTA-18.

### REPORT ON THE SESSION

The report on the session  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.13) was adopted on Tuesday, 29 October. Chair  Thorgeirsson then closed SBSTA-17.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

On Wednesday, 23 October, SBI Chair RaÃºl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina)  opened the first meeting of SBI-17. Parties adopted the agenda  (FCCC/SBI/2002/7). On Friday, 1 November, Chair Estrada announced  that Fadhel Lari (Kuwait) had been nominated as SBI Vice-Chair and  Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) as Rapporteur. Parties approved the  elections by acclamation. All SBI conclusions and draft decisions  were forwarded to the COP and adopted on Friday, 1 November.

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM ANNEX I PARTIES

On Wednesday, 23  October, the Secretariat introduced the status report on the  review of the third national communications. Chair Estrada said  that Parties would discuss, among other issues, possible dates for  the submission of the fourth national communications. On Thursday,  24 October, the EU requested the SBSTA to consider including  reporting on P&Ms and proposed that the fourth national  communications be submitted on 1 January 2006, to coincide with  the reporting process on demonstrable progress. Canada, supported  by the US, said that it would be premature to undertake major  revisions to the guidelines. India emphasized strengthening the  reporting process for Annex I Parties. Chair Estrada said he would  produce recommendations for the SBI based on consultations with  delegates.

On Tuesday, 29 October, Parties agreed to conclusions and a  decision on Annex I national communications.

###     SBI Conclusions and COP Draft Decision

The SBI conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.9 and Corr.1), inter alia, note that 12 Parties  had been visited by international review teams, and the  information contained in national communications provided a basis  for the consideration of progress in the implementation of the  UNFCCC.

The COP draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.9/Add.1): urges Annex I  Parties that have not submitted their first, second, or third  national communication or annual greenhouse gas inventory to do so  as soon as possible; requests the Parties to submit a fourth  national communication by 1 January 2006; and concludes that  review of the national communications should continue.

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM NON-ANNEX I PARTIES

Consideration of  the Fourth Compilation and Synthesis of Initial National  Communications: This issue was discussed in the SBI Plenary twice.  On Wednesday, 23 October, Chair Estrada said that the Secretariat  would prepare a report to be addressed at SBI-18. On Thursday, 31  October, Parties agreed on the COP draft decision.

###     COP Draft Decision

The draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.23)  requests: non-Annex I Parties that have not submitted initial  national communications to do so as soon as possible, on the  understanding that LDCs may submit their national communications  at their discretion; the Secretariat to prepare the fifth  compilation and synthesis report on initial national  communications; and an information document describing steps taken  by non-Annex I Parties to implement the UNFCCC.

###     Improvement of Guidelines for the Preparation of Non-Annex I  National Communications

On Wednesday, 23 October, the Secretariat  introduced the proposed improved guidelines for non-Annex I  national communications. The GEF expressed concern about the  inestimable funding requirements of proposed guidelines for  developing local emissions factors and on vulnerability and  adaptation assessments, and remarked that without these, funding  requirements would only be marginally higher than current levels.  Several LDCs highlighted their difficulties in developing national  communications and called on the SBSTA to address financial  support. Tuvalu drew attention to possible negative implications  of tying adaptation finance to the completion of national  communications.

On Thursday, 24 October, Parties agreed to use text prepared by  the G-77/China as the basis for discussion. On Friday, Saturday  and Monday, 25-28 October, Parties continued deliberations on the  issue in formal and informal groups. On Tuesday, 29 October, Chair  Romero reminded delegates that unless agreement was reached on the  improved guidelines, the second national communications would be  prepared using the existing guidelines.

On Wednesday, 30 October, Parties returned to the beginning of the  text in an effort to remove remaining brackets, with little  progress. On Thursday afternoon, 31 October, SBI Chair Estrada  convened a high-level contact group and introduced a new draft of  the guidelines. The G-77/China accepted the text as a basis for  discussion, and several others aired concerns, which Chair Estrada  said could not be integrated into the guidelines, but could be  mentioned in his oral report to the COP.

Thursday evening, Chair Estrada said the draft decision was not  yet available. Noting that delegations had a number of suggestions,  additions and proposals for the document, he said Parties had  agreed to adopt the guidelines 'in a spirit of compromise.' The EU  requested to see the decision. Canada stressed 'normal' UN  procedures by which documents are seen before they are adopted.  Chair Estrada adjourned the meeting, saying the text would be  ready for consideration on Friday, 1 November.

In the final SBI meeting on 1 November, Chair Estrada introduced  the draft decision and an addendum including the guidelines in an  annex, and noted an additional document outlining further  amendments proposed by the Chair. With amendments proposed by  Australia and Japan, Parties adopted the draft decision.

###     COP Draft Decision

In the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.26 and  Add.1), Parties decide that:non-Annex I Parties should use the guidelines contained in  the annex for the preparation of second and, where appropriate,  third national communications, except where Parties have initiated  the process of preparing second national communications; the guidelines should be used to provide guidance to an  operating entity of the financial mechanism for funding the  preparation of national communications; and COP-9 shall determine the frequency of submissions.

The decision also invites non-Annex I Parties wishing to use  elements from the guidelines for Annex I national communications  to do so.

###     Work of the Consultative Group of Experts on Non-Annex I National  Communications

A new mandate and revised terms of reference for  the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national  communications (CGE) was taken up twice in the SBI, and several  times in the contact group on non-Annex I issues chaired by JosÃ©  Romero (Switzerland).

On Wednesday, 23 October, CGE Chair Mahendra Kumar (Fiji)  presented the final report of the CGE, stressing that the process  plays an important role in capacity building through the sharing  of experiences and the evaluation of technical problems and  constraints. The CGE proposed several recommendations, including  that additional financial and technical resources be mobilized,  and that the IPCC develop methods and tools for assessing impacts  on time-scales relevant to policy-makers.

In the non-Annex I issues contact group on Thursday, 31 October,  Parties discussed the text of the draft decision. The EU called  for the initiation of a process for the voluntary review of  national communications. SBI Chair Estrada noted that the review  of national communications was a key difference between the  processes of Annex I and non-Annex I national communications.  Following a query from Japan on the funding for CGE meetings, the  US expressed surprise to hear that funding came from the core  budget, and said she could not agree to the text without further  consultations. Chair Estrada said that he would take the text as  it stood to the Plenary for Parties to accept or reject.

In the SBI Plenary on Friday, 1 November, Parties approved the  draft decision on the work of the CGE, and the terms of reference  of the CGE included in an annex to the decision.

###     COP Draft Decision

In the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.25),  Parties decide to continue supporting the mandate of the CGE, to  be reviewed at COP-13. The terms of reference of the CGE include,  among other things, details on the 24 experts, and the period of  nomination of the experts. They outline the mandate of the CGE,  including to:identify and assess technical problems and constraints that  have affected the preparation of initial national communications; review existing activities and programmes, including those of  multilateral and bilateral funding sources; provide technical advice to the SBI on matters relating to  the implementation of the UNFCCC by non-Annex I Parties; and develop the agenda for workshops and meetings.

###     Provision of Financial and Technical Support

This issue was taken  up in SBI on Wednesday, 23 October. Parties agreed that Chair  Estrada would draft conclusions. On Friday, 1 November, Parties  agreed on the conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.24), the SBI  takes note of: progress made by non-Annex I Parties in the  preparation of their national communications; information provided  by the GEF on its activities in support of initial national  communications; and the list of projects for funding. It also  requests the Secretariat to initiate the assessment of activities  aimed at reducing emissions and enhancing removals of greenhouse  gases reported in national communications.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

In the SBI Plenary on Thursday, 24 October,  the G-77/China expressed concern regarding the conditionality of  GEF funding. Chair Estrada cautioned against possible  inconsistencies between COP guidance to the GEF and GEF decisions  on funding modalities. On funding under the UNFCCC, the GEF noted  that its current operational procedures would apply to the Special  Climate Change Fund until the COP provides additional guidance.

In a contact group meeting on Monday, 28 October, Parties could  not agree on a process to provide additional guidance on the  operation of the Special Climate Change Fund. Norway, Switzerland,  Canada, Japan and the EU, opposed by India, Brazil, Barbados and  China, requested the option to provide further submissions on the  operational priorities of the Fund at SBI-18. Delegates then heard  views on the LDC Fund and decided to continue negotiations though  informal consultations. On the review of the financial mechanism,  Parties could not agree on text initiating a process to aggregate  GEF funding requirements for the UNFCCC.

On Tuesday, 29 October, the contact group continued discussions on  the report of the GEF, with Parties failing to reach agreement on  negotiating text tabled by the EU and Canada. On guidance to the  Special Climate Change Fund, Parties agreed to a proposal from the  EU to conclude a decision at COP-9. Following informal  consultations on the LDC Fund, delegates agreed to a draft  decision on additional guidance. On the provision of additional  guidance to the GEF, several Parties requested this discussion be  delayed until receiving text from relevant contact groups.  Regarding the review of the financial mechanism, the EU expressed  concern with moving forward on the basis of the Chair's draft  decision and distributed a new proposal. During a late night  session, the contact group reached consensus on the outstanding  elements and agreed to forward their conclusions and draft  decisions to the SBI Plenary.

In the final SBI Plenary on Friday, 1 November, the G-77/China,  opposed by the EU, Norway, Japan and Canada, attempted to re-open  the timeframe for providing guidance on the Special Climate Change  Fund, deleting laudatory language on the third GEF replenishment  and a request for an expert group. Chair Estrada requested Parties  to consult informally and return with a consensus text, which was  adopted.

On Friday, 1 November, the SBI adopted the decisions on the LDC  Fund, the report of the GEF, the review of the financial mechanism  and additional guidance to an operating entity of the financial  mechanism, with minor editorial changes. The COP subsequently  adopted the decisions the same day.

###     SBI Conclusions and COP Draft Decisions

The SBI conclusions on  the report of the GEF (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.19) request the GEF to  enhance its strategic business plan for the allocation of scarce  GEF resources, and to include in its report to COP-9 detailed  information on how it has applied the guidance on funding  activities related to decisions of the COP.

The COP draft decision on guidance to an entity entrusted with the  operation of the UNFCCC financial mechanism for the LDC Fund  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.21), requests the financial mechanism to ensure  the speedy release and disbursements of funds and timely  assistance for the preparation of NAPAs and the organization of  four regional workshops on the advancement of the preparation of  NAPAs.

The draft decision on initial guidance to an entity entrusted with  the operation of the UNFCCC financial mechanism for the operation  of the Special Climate Change Fund (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.22) initiates  a process now, with a view to providing further guidance to the  GEF. A decision at COP-9 will the provide guidance to the GEF in  order to operationalize the fund without delay. The decision  promotes, inter alia, complementarity between the Fund and other  funds entrusted to the operational entity. It recommends  streamlined procedures for the operation of the Fund, while  ensuring sound financial management.

The draft decision on the review of the financial mechanism  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.18) requests: the Secretariat to prepare for  consideration at SBI-20 a report on the implementation of  decisions 12/CP.2 (Memorandum of Understanding between the COP and  the GEF Council) and 12/CP.3 (annex to the MOU on the  determination of funding necessary and available for the  implementation of the UNFCCC). It also requests the GEF to review  its project cycle with a view to making it simpler and more  efficient and decides to initiate the third review of the  financial mechanism at SBI-21.

The draft decision on additional guidance to an operating entity  of the financial mechanism (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.20) contains guidance  to the GEF to provide financial support and additional resources  related to the implementation of COP decisions on national  communications, capacity building, technology transfer, Article 6  and matters related to the report of the GEF to the COP.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This issue was discussed in the opening Plenary  and in informal consultations facilitated by Dechen Tsering  (Bhutan). In the opening Plenary on Thursday, 24 October, the  Central Group of Eleven (CG-11), called for further consultations  to develop a future framework for the economies in transition. The  G-77/China expressed concern that the COP-7 decision on capacity- building had not been implemented by the GEF. On Friday, 1  November, the SBI adopted the Chair's conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.15) note the  need to further implement decisions 2/CP.7 (capacity building in  developing countries) and 3/CP.7 (capacity building in economies  in transition) and invites Parties to submit their views on  detailed elements, methodologies and guidelines for the  comprehensive review of the implementation of the capacity- building framework for developing countries.

IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9 - Progress on the  Implementation of Activities under Decision 5/CP.7: This issue was  taken up in the SBI and in informal consultations facilitated by  Daniela Stoytcheva (Bulgaria) and Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu). On  Friday, 25 October, Parties discussed implementation issues under  Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects), as well as the outcomes of  a workshop on modeling held in Bonn in May 2002, and the terms of  reference for workshops on insurance and risk assessment. The G-77/China expressed concern about the lack of financial support for  implementation of the decision. She called for a mechanism to  finance the workshops and proposed creating an expert group on  adaptation. Canada expressed interest in supporting the workshops,  and Iran offered to host them.

On Tuesday, 29 October, the SBI adopted conclusions on progress in  the implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7. It was  agreed that the subsidiary body Chairs and the Secretariat would  make arrangements for a meeting on the implementation of decision  5/CP.7, to be held back-to-back with a workshop on cooperation  with international organizations proposed by the SBSTA.

###     SBI Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.17) note  progress in the implementation of decision 5/CP.7; request the  Secretariat to organize workshops on insurance; decide to consider  the reports of the workshops at COP-9; and invite Parties to  submit further views relating to progress in the implementation of  decision 5/CP.7 by 15 April 2003.

###     Matters relating to LDCs

On Friday, 25 October, LDC Expert Group  (LEG) Chair Bubu Jallow (Gambia) reported on the second meeting of  the Group and on progress in implementing the LEG work programme.  He highlighted a workshop held in Dhaka that aimed to develop  NAPAs. He noted that the Group had decided against revising NAPA  guidelines at COP-8, preferring to do this at COP-9.

On Tuesday, 29 October, SBI approved a draft decision on matters  related to LDCs.

###     COP Draft Decision

In the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.8), the  COP: decides to postpone the revision of NAPA guidelines; invites  the LDCs to use the annotations to the NAPA guidelines prepared by  the LEG; and decides to review the NAPA guidelines at COP-9.

### REQUEST FROM A GROUP OF COUNTRIES OF CENTRAL ASIA AND THE CAUCASUS,  ALBANIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA REGARDING THEIR STATUS UNDER  THE UNFCCC

This issue was discussed in the SBI on Thursday, 24  October. Chair Estrada noted a lack of consensus on the proposal  from the group of countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus,  Albania and the Republic of Moldova (CACAM) regarding a clear  definition of the term 'developing countries' and the status of  the group in the context of COP decisions, including those  prepared at COP-6 Part II. He said, however, that Parties agree  that the countries should be able to access financial resources  provided for in UNFCCC decisions. The CACAM group proposed the  definition 'developing countries and other countries not included  in Annex I.' On Tuesday, 29 October, the SBI, noting that the CACAM can access  GEF funding, adopted conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.14) recommend  that in future all references to Parties in COP decisions should  follow the language of the UNFCCC, for example 'Parties included  in Annex I,' 'Parties included in Annex II' and 'Parties not  included in Annex I.'

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This agenda item,  with its sub-items, was discussed in the SBI Plenary on Friday, 25  October, and conclusions were adopted on Tuesday, 29 October.

###     Date and Venue for COP-9

Italy offered to host COP-9 in the  absence of an offer from the Eastern European regional group.  Delegates decided to authorize the Bureau to decide on the venue.  The SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.10).

###     Arrangements for COP/MOP-1

The Secretariat presented a paper  proposing an integrated approach to the COP and MOP sessions. The  EU, Canada, Australia and Japan, opposed by Slovenia, supported  one combined session for the sake of efficiency, noting that some  details needed clarification. The US stressed the need to ensure  that its contributions were used to support the UNFCCC process.  The SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.16 and Add.1).

###     Effective Participation in the UNFCCC Process

The Secretariat  outlined options and proposals for the participation of observers  in intersessional workshops and meetings of limited membership  bodies. Canada, with Australia and the EU, advocated transparency  while recognizing financial realities. The US supported  participation through new approaches, including a constituency  system. The SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.13),  recording that the EU did not agree with the conclusions, since  the text was introduced only at this SBI session and had not  previously been available.

###     Administrative and Financial Matters

This matter was referred by  the COP to the SBI, which took it up on Thursday, 24 October, when  the Executive Secretary presented the reports on administrative  and financial matters. Switzerland and Bulgaria supported a text  proposed by Canada urging Parties to ensure early payment of  contributions. Canada requested the Secretariat to provide its  budget requirements for the activities relating to implementation  of the Marrakesh Accords. The COP adopted the decision on Friday,  1 November.

###     COP Draft Decision

The draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.7) notes  with concern the large number of Parties that have not made their  contributions for 2002 and urges these Parties to do so without  delay.

OTHER MATTERS - Proposal by Croatia on LULUCF: During the SBI  session on Friday, 25 October, delegates requested the SBSTA  informal group, chaired by Jim Penman (UK), to also consider the  Croatian proposal regarding its allowance for forest management  credits. The SBI decided in its session on Tuesday, 29 October, to  continue consideration of the Croatian proposal, and adopted  conclusions prepared by the informal group. The SBI also decided  to continue consideration of Croatia's request with regard to its  base year for emissions calculations, noting a SBSTA decision  forwarded to the SBI on the matter.

###     SBI Conclusions

The SBI conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.11) decide  that the SBI will continue consideration on the Croatian proposal  on LULUCF at SBI-18, and invite Croatia to provide country- specific data and other information. The conclusions on Croatia's  base year emissions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.12) note that the SBI will  continue consideration at SBI-18.

### REPORT ON THE SESSION

On Friday, 1 November, Chair Estrada  presented the report of the session (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.6). Parties  adopted the report, and Chair Estrada announced SBI-17 closed.

# PLENARY

### FOLLOW-UP TO THE WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

In the  opening COP Plenary on Wednesday, 23 October, UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter reported on the outcomes of the World  Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). She noted that the  Summit reaffirmed sustainable development's central place on the  international agenda and highlighted that the Johannesburg Plan of  Implementation called for: greenhouse gas emission reductions;  ratification of the Kyoto Protocol; provision of technical and  financial support and capacity building; ensuring energy access  and increasing the share of renewable energy resources; and  enhancement of synergies between the CBD, UNCCD and UNFCCC. The  COP took note of the report.

### REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THE CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM

The Report on Guidance to the CDM Executive Board and its annex  containing draft rules of procedure were presented to the COP  Plenary on Friday, 25 October, and the decision was adopted by the  COP on Friday, 1 November.

###     COP Decision

The decision (FCCC/2002/L.5 and Add.1) adopts, inter  alia: the implementation of work plan tasks; financial and  operational procedures; and the draft rules of procedure. The  draft rules lay out the nomination, election and re-election of  the board members and their alternates, meetings, and the role of  the UNFCCC Secretariat.

###     OTHER MATTERS -- Impacts of Single Projects

The COP Secretary  said this issue was introduced following a proposal from Iceland.  He noted that decision 14/CP.7 (impacts of single projects) states  that industrial process CO2 emissions resulting from a single  project that amount to more than 5% of the 1990 base year  emissions can be reported separately. He said the COP-7 decision  required any Party wishing to report separately should make a  notification before COP-8. Two notifications, from Iceland and  Monaco, had been received and were included in a miscellaneous  document. The COP took note of this information.

# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

### INAUGURATION OF THE HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

Prime Minister Atal Bihari  Vajpayee of India inaugurated the high-level segment on Wednesday,  30 October, with the 'lighting of the lamp' ceremony. COP-8  President Baalu expressed hope that the Delhi Declaration would  become a historic milestone in the UNFCCC process.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter noted achievements  since COP-7, including the WSSD outcomes. Emphasizing the  importance of implementation, she supported practical approaches,  including: action on adaptation and vulnerability; the development  of national communications; and use of the CDM.

UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs Nitin  Desai delivered a message on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi  Annan. He said that one challenge for the COP was to consider to  what extent the approaches, goals and methods agreed at WSSD could  be a basis for cooperation in this forum.

Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee noted India's  commitment to combating global climate change, remarking on its  renewable energy sector and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. He  highlighted the importance of adaptation, vulnerability, and  capacity building for developing counties, and said that  consideration of developing country commitments would be premature  due to, among other things, inequitable per-capita emissions  rights, and differences in per-capita income between developing  and developed countries.

### STATEMENTS FROM HEADS OF UN AGENCIES

The World Meteorological  Organization Secretary General G. O. P. Obasi called on Parties to  continue supporting the systematic observation of the atmosphere  and other activities to reduce scientific uncertainties. Noting  that those in poverty will suffer most from the adverse effects of  climate change, UNEP Executive Director Klaus TÃ¶pfer called for  concrete action on adaptation as well as mitigation.

### STATEMENTS FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS

The IPCC  encouraged Parties to make maximum use of the IPCC TAR in their  deliberations, and noted that the Fourth Assessment Report would  focus more on the costs and benefits of mitigation options and  hopefully include regional analyses. The GEF remarked on the third  replenishment, which will allow the GEF to increase funding for  climate change related activities, and noted that the GEF will  make initial disbursements under the UNFCCC LDC Fund in the coming  weeks. The World Bank stressed its commitment to supporting carbon  finance and noted the growth in renewable energy investments,  which presently account for 64% of the Bank's energy-lending  portfolio.

OPEC reminded delegates of the need to minimize the adverse  effects of policies and measures to address climate change and  said that adequate provision should be made for the transfer of  technology to developing countries. The Asian-African Legal  Consultative Organization stressed that the principle of common  but differentiated responsibilities should remain as the basis for  the UNFCCC process. The Asian Development Bank said that it has  provided assistance to developing countries for least-cost  adaptation and capacity building.

### STATEMENTS FROM NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS

The Climate Action  Network called for substantial financial transfers from developed  countries to developing countries to support adaptation, and for  measures to keep temperature change well below 2 degrees Celsius,  while ensuring development. Business and industry NGOs called for  clear rules and procedures, particularly relating to the CDM.

The Federation of the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry  called for an efficient and transparent policy framework.

The International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives  (ICLEI) highlighted local initiatives to combat climate change,  and stressed the need for financial resources.

A representative of Indigenous Peoples Organizations noted the  vulnerability of indigenous peoples and their important role in  the protection of natural resources and called for support for  their participation in the UNFCCC process.

Noting the vulnerable role of workers, the International  Confederation of Free Trade Unions noted the employment  opportunities inherent in emissions mitigation.

The Tata Energy and Research Institute announced that NGOs  undertaking independent research and analysis on climate change  issues have formed a new group, the research and independent NGOs,  RINGOs.

### PRESENTATION OF A CHILDREN'S CHARTER TO THE PRESIDENT

Two youth  delegates presented a Children's Charter to COP-8 President Baalu.  The Charter highlights several concerns faced by India's youth,  including the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations, the rise  in sea levels, and the threat climate change poses to flora and  fauna.

### ROUND TABLE I - 'TAKING STOCK

' COP President Baalu welcomed  delegates to the first ministerial round table under the theme  'Taking Stock,' co-chaired by Minister Margaret Beckett (UK).  While noting the comprehensive climate change mitigation framework  already achieved, Co-Chair Beckett said there is no room for  complacency.

Many delegates highlighted their domestic circumstances, actions  and experiences. AOSIS noted that small island developing States  are among those hardest hit by climate change. Finland stressed  the EU's efforts to achieve tangible results and show demonstrable  progress by 2005.

On meeting the UNFCCC's ultimate objective, New Zealand said that  not nearly enough progress has been made to date. The EU called  for a common dialogue, including identifying a level of non- dangerous emissions concentrations. AOSIS called for an immediate  reduction in global emissions of 50-80%. The Climate Action  Network urged the COP to begin discussions on establishing limits  to prevent dangerous climate change. Ireland proposed discussion  on a fair and equitable distribution of emission targets.

On future action, AOSIS and Japan said all countries will need to  be involved in mitigation. Recognizing that countries will carry  different burdens with regard to mitigation, Switzerland stressed  cooperation and partnerships. Poland said adaptation and funding  for climate change must go hand-in-hand with mitigation and long- term strategies.

AOSIS, Mexico and Uganda noted that Annex I countries are not  fulfilling their commitments and emissions are on the rise.  Considering this, Malaysia questioned how some Annex I countries  can propose developing country emissions reduction commitments.  Thailand, Venezuela, Tanzania and Saudi Arabia opposed discussion  of reduction commitments for developing countries. The EU  underscored the need for dialogue.

Uganda, Iran and Malaysia urged further efforts with regard to  transfer of technology, financial resources and capacity building.  Nepal underscored the need for further research to mitigate the  effects of climate change.

Ethiopia said economic development is crucial for adapting to  climate change, and urged increased financial support. Iran  stressed minimizing losses due to adverse effects and impacts of  response measures on developing countries with economies dependent  on fossil fuels.

Finland and Denmark pledged support to the LDC Fund. Kenya and  Uganda appealed for a special fund for developing countries other  than LDCs.

On the CDM, Colombia supported sequestration projects. ICLEI  supported simplified procedures. Uruguay said the lack of  institutional and legal capacity was a barrier to CDM  implementation.

On ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, New Zealand said his  country will 'almost certainly' ratify the Protocol next month.  The Republic of Korea, Japan, Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Kenya, the EU  and Brazil urged remaining countries to ratify.

On the Delhi Declaration, Japan supported including reference to  future reductions. Uganda said the Declaration should call for the  ratification of the Protocol. Switzerland supported reference to a  forward-looking approach. Australia said it should put into place  a process for future global emissions reduction arrangements. The  Republic of Korea supported a Declaration that considers the human  dimension to climate change. Co-Chair Beckett summarized the  session's key themes and closed the session.

### ROUND TABLE II - 'CLIMATE CHANGE AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT'

COP-8 President Baalu opened the session on Thursday, 31 October,  and Co-Chair Mohammed Valli Moosa (South Africa) highlighted  consumption, and energy supply and access as issues where climate  change and sustainable development meet.

Uganda recalled the Millennium Development Goals and said climate  change 'cripples' developing country economies, hindering  sustainable development. Slovakia stressed the need to move beyond  politicized negotiations to real action.

Namibia announced its ratification of the Protocol.

Greece, Belgium, Spain and Slovenia supported renewable energy and  energy efficiency. Germany said the EU would build a coalition of  like-minded countries willing to commit themselves to timetables  and targets for increasing renewable energy use. Stressing that  combating poverty was the agreed priority, Kuwait said issues  related to renewable energy should not be introduced at this point.

Mauritius called for Parties to give practical meaning to  technology transfer. Mozambique urged financial support for  implementing NAPAs and strengthening existing national focal  points. Kiribati underscored the need for development projects to  incorporate climate change considerations. Israel said that it was  developing a greenhouse gas emissions reduction policy.

On the CDM, Uganda said the poorest and most vulnerable countries,  many of which are in Africa, may not attract profit-driven CDM  projects. The International Chamber of Commerce cautioned that CDM  modalities are becoming too complex, and stressed a need for  regulatory certainty. Bangladesh supported a multilateral CDM  programme for LDCs.

The US said that its climate approach is grounded in sound  economic policy and noted its commitment to reduce the greenhouse  gas intensity of its economy by 18% over ten years. The US claimed  that economic growth is the key to environmental progress. Germany  responded by calling for 'absolute' emissions reductions, noting  that a failure to address climate change would result in economic  harm. Regarding future actions, he said it would commit itself to  a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels by  2020 if all developed countries committed themselves to further  reductions, and the EU committed itself to emissions reductions of  about 30%. Sweden, supported by the Russian Federation and Belgium,  and opposed by Oman and Nigeria, called for a dialogue on  developing country commitments. Co-Chair Moosa summarized the  discussions and closed the session.

### ROUND TABLE III - 'WRAP-UP

' On Thursday afternoon, 31 October,  COP-8 President Baalu opened the third and final round table.  Addressing the Delhi Declaration, Italy said it should consider  action beyond 2012. Canada said it should consider, inter alia:  ratification of the Protocol; recommendations of the IPCC TAR;  efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and the UNFCCC's  ultimate objectives. The Cook Islands called for a World Climate  Day. Saudi Arabia said that the Declaration should be a consensus  document prioritizing adaptation to climate impacts and impacts of  Annex I response measures.

On non-Annex I commitments, the G-77/China opposed any text that  would infer new commitments. Venezuela called on the COP to  address compliance under the UNFCCC and the Marrakesh Accords.  Claiming a right to development, Cuba opposed new commitments for  developing countries. The EU underscored that mitigation has  proven to be a powerful force for technological change and  economic development. Iceland addressed carbon intensities and the  need to stimulate the development of technologies to avoid  wasteful emissions. India called for the provision of sufficient  environmental 'space' for developing countries to develop.  Thailand asked Parties to differentiate between luxury and  survival emissions.

Noting that biodiversity, coral reefs and the existence of some  cultures are threatened by global warming, Palau called for  immediate greenhouse gas emissions reductions by all Parties.

Qatar, Egypt and Algeria opposed new commitments and urged Parties  to operationalize UNFCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9.

On the need to address sustainable development, Brazil said  policies and measures must be linked with actions to promote  renewable energy, technology transfer and capacity building. The  EU stressed that renewable energy exemplified the synergies  between sustainable development and climate change.

Chile emphasized that national strategies for sustainable  development must address adaptation and mitigation policies.

On the CDM, Papua New Guinea called for greater forest and  biodiversity incentives. Brazil supported projects in large cities.  Tanzania stressed equity in the distribution of projects.

On capacity building, Nepal, for LDCs, stressed that institutional  capacity building is a priority need and called for the immediate  implementation of the work programme under UNFCCC Article 6  (education, training and public awareness).

COP President Baalu then closed the high-level segment.

# THE DELHI DECLARATION

The Delhi Declaration was addressed informally in the Plenary on  Friday, 25 October, and in informal discussion throughout the week.  On Friday, 1 November, the COP Plenary adopted the Declaration.

In informal discussions in conjunction with the COP Plenary on  Friday, 25 October, numerous speakers supported an implementation- oriented declaration focusing on climate change and sustainable  development, building on the WSSD outcome. Several Parties  proposed urging the ratification of the Protocol, and emphasized a  focus on adaptation and poverty eradication. Many argued for a  two-pronged approach that would stress mitigation and adaptation.  Several Annex I countries supported a forward-looking declaration  that would emphasize the need to broaden and deepen commitments  globally in preparation for the second commitment period and  beyond.

Stressing the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities, a number of developing country representatives  said Annex I Parties must take the lead, and opposed any process  that would result in new developing country commitments. The US  stressed economic growth as the key to environmental progress,  cautioning against burdensome targets for developing countries.  Many countries supported an emphasis on renewable energy.

In the COP Plenary Friday evening, 1 November, President Baalu  said extensive informal consultations had been held and proposed  the adoption of the Declaration.

The CG-11 noted that the group could not support the Declaration,  but would not block its adoption. The COP adopted the Delhi  Declaration.

The EU submitted a statement of concern regarding the Declaration,  calling on all countries to engage in a common dialogue with a  view to further action consistent with the UNFCCC's ultimate  objective and based on the TAR. Noting views from across the board  in support of new commitments for developing countries, he  stressed that the world is not 'divided into two.' The G-77/China, with the US and China, expressed its full support  for the Delhi Declaration. Canada, with Tuvalu and Japan, said the  Declaration was a disappointment as it failed to respond to the  TAR and did not provide a long-term collective plan. He stressed  that without a substantial increase in global mitigation, the race  to adapt in time would be lost. Japan noted that COP-8 had  succeeded in opening a small window of opportunity for on-going  informal dialogue on future mitigation action.

Saudi Arabia said the Delhi Declaration was well balanced, and  Nigeria noted that the Declaration recognized the needs of the  developing world and pointed the way to new avenues of cooperation  between the North and South. He praised the US, noting it had  shown leadership and signaled 'a good prospect for change in the  dynamics of the COP.'Declaration Text: The Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and  Sustainable Development (FCCC/CP/2002/L.6 Rev.1): recalls the  UNFCCC ultimate objective; reaffirms development and poverty  eradication as overriding priorities in developing countries;  recognizes with concern the findings of the TAR and its ongoing  consideration in the SBSTA; notes the need for both mitigation and  adaptation measures; expresses concern at the vulnerability of  developing countries, especially LDCs and small island developing  States; and recognizes Africa as the region suffering most from  the combined impacts of climate change and poverty.

The Declaration calls for Parties that have ratified the Protocol  to urge others to ratify. It calls for policies and measures  specific to each country's conditions, integration of climate  change objectives into national sustainable development strategies,  and implementation of UNFCCC commitments according to Parties'  common but differentiated responsibilities, development priorities  and circumstances. It stresses adaptation, the exchange of  information, and consideration of developing country concerns  arising from the adverse effects of climate change and  implementation of response measures.

The Declaration further calls for development, dissemination and  investment in innovative technologies, the strengthening of  technology transfer, as well as improved energy access,  diversification of energy supplies and an increase in the use of  renewable energy. It also stresses the need for Annex I Parties to  take the lead and further implement their commitments under the  UNFCCC, including with regard to the provision of financial  resources, technology transfer and capacity building.

# CLOSING PLENARY

During the final sessions of the COP Plenary on Friday, 1 November,  the COP adopted the draft decisions and conclusions forwarded by  the SBSTA, and the report of the SBSTA (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.13). The  COP also adopted the draft decisions and conclusions forwarded by  the SBI and the report of the SBI (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.6).

COP-8 Rapporteur MenÃ©ndez introduced the report of COP-8  (FCCC/CP/2002/L.1 and Add.1), which Parties adopted. UK Minister  Beckett introduced and the COP adopted a resolution expressing  gratitude to the Government of India (FCCC/CP/2002/L.7).  Expressing thanks to Parties, the Bureau, the Executive Secretary  and the delegation of India, COP-8 President Baalu said the  noteworthy efforts of all had culminated in the Delhi Declaration,  making the meeting a major milestone in combating climate change.  He declared the meeting closed at 8:54 pm.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF COP-8 NEGOTIATING DICHOTOMIES

First-time visitors to Delhi are often fascinated by the  incongruity of a city divided in two. Old Delhi, a labyrinth of  small streets, contrasts starkly with the grand avenues of  monumental New Delhi. Yet both Old and New Delhi have much in  common: busy streets, bustling markets and thick smog. A series of  policies and measures to reduce air pollution have been reasonably  successful, although the problem remains.

In their attempts to address common concerns about atmospheric  pollution of a global kind, COP-8 negotiators quickly uncovered  incongruities of their own. Dichotomies, real and imagined, true  and false, seemed to emerge on every issue and in every context.  In particular, negotiators grappled with the divergence between  developed and developing country positions, and different views on  adaptation and mitigation, the UNFCCC and Protocol, and  environment and development.

# DEVELOPED/DEVELOPING

The usual division between developed and developing country  positions on many issues was in evidence at COP-8. Many countries  had hoped that the developed/developing country dichotomy would  break down, exposing the variety of interests within non-Annex I  countries. This would have facilitated the adoption of a Delhi  Declaration initiating a dialogue on broadening commitments, in  accordance with the stated positions of Annex I countries. Instead,  the voice of non-Annex I countries in favor of such a declaration  was drowned by calls from more powerful developing countries in  favor of a declaration focusing on adaptation.

The initial draft of the Delhi Declaration stressed adaptation and  did not contain a single reference to the Kyoto Protocol, pleasing  the OPEC member States chairing the G-77/China. Some negotiators  claimed that portions of text from other declarations and  documents had simply been compiled. It was upon the release of  this draft that delegates began questioning COP-8 President  Baalu's leadership.

Informal discussions between ministers and heads of delegations on  the Delhi Declaration were variously described as 'impossible' and  'intense.' Though discussions were generally divided along  developed/developing country lines, there was one important  exception. The US reportedly supported the G-77/China position,  and in the final plenary, was the only Annex I country to state  its complete satisfaction with the Declaration, which does not  call for any follow-up action whatsoever, let alone the initiation  of a dialogue. The US ultimately received a heartfelt expression  of gratitude from Nigeria during the closing plenary. It was  rumoured that, despite its historical position in favor of  broadening commitments, the US found a weak declaration more  convenient than a strong one, given the US repudiation of the  Protocol and the need for developing country allies in the war on  terrorism.

Negotiations on the draft decision on policies and measures,  meanwhile, were almost completely polarized. Developed countries  tried to insert a provision allowing voluntary information  exchange on developing country P&Ms, and developing countries  insisted on a heavy emphasis on the need to minimize the adverse  effects of P&Ms. The G-77/China refused to negotiate after a time,  citing a lack of progress in negotiations on Protocol Article 2.3.  Unwilling to concede on adverse effects, developed countries  allowed consideration of P&Ms to be deferred to COP-9.

# ADAPTATION/MITIGATION

COP-8 was also characterized by claims and counter claims about  the nature of adaptation and mitigation. Some Parties viewed these  as 'two sides of the same coin,' while others claimed that  mitigation and adaptation are separate issues, mitigation applying  to developed countries and adaptation applying to developing  countries. Attempts to achieve a balance between adaptation and  mitigation in the Delhi Declaration clearly failed, but the  difficulties presented by this dichotomy affected negotiations on  other issues as well.

Discussions on the improved guidelines for non-Annex I national  communications began with one Annex I Party calling for the  Chair's text to reflect a balance between adaptation and  mitigation reporting requirements. Parties had difficulty agreeing  on what should be reported, let alone when to use 'shall' instead  of 'should.' Developing countries have an interest in reporting on  their adaptation needs, but improvements in the content and  comparability of national communications could make it more  difficult for developing countries to secure funding if they fail  to provide requested information. Moreover, good quality  information on developing country emissions and capacities could  open the door to a broadening of commitments. In this connection,  the G-77/China succeeded in obstructing an EU proposal for the  voluntary review of national communications. Eventually, Parties  adopted a Chair's compromise text that resembles the positions of  non-Annex I countries.

The issue of the adverse effects of policies and measures on  developing countries, meanwhile, was used by the G-77/China at  COP-8 to ensure delegates focused on the question of adaptation in  developing countries, rather than mitigation. The G-77/China cast  mitigation exclusively in terms of the implementation of existing  commitments, repeatedly noting in discussions on P&Ms that Annex I  Parties' emissions continue to increase, and that their policies  and measures are not designed to minimize adverse effects. The  argument made by most Annex I Parties and some developing  countries particularly threatened by climate change, that  adaptation will ultimately be useless unless climate change is  allayed by global mitigation efforts, did not seem to have any  impact on the leaders of G-77/China.

# UNFCCC/PROTOCOL

Australia and the US introduced a new dichotomy into the climate  change negotiations last year by behaving as if the Protocol is  somehow antithetical to the goals of the UNFCCC. The US  repudiation of the Protocol has been particularly damaging, and at  COP-8, many observers noted that the US delegation interfered in  progress on several Protocol issues besides the Delhi Declaration.

For instance, the US delegation substantially affected discussions  on the issue of trade in cleaner energy. The original proposal by  Canada on cleaner energy would have given it assigned amount units  for the environmental benefit created by its exports to the US of  cleaner energy. Most Parties objected to this proposal at SB-16 in  Bonn, with the notable exception of the US. When the US objected  at COP-8 to a new Canadian proposal, which merely requested an  analysis of the role of trade in cleaner energy, some could not  help but speculate that the US was trying to discourage Canadian  ratification. Other more sympathetic observers believed the US  objected to stem discussion on adverse effects, which the G-77/China had linked to the Canadian proposal during discussions on  the SB-16 agenda. In any event, although discussions on cleaner  energy did not lead to substantive conclusions, Canada gave no  indication that this would dampen the Prime Minister's resolve to  ratify the Protocol.

# ENVIRONMENT/DEVELOPMENT

Another dichotomy that marked COP-8 was that of  environment/development. At the WSSD, States agreed on the  falseness of this dichotomy, embracing the concept of sustainable  development.

During the COP-8 high-level round tables, however, it became clear  that Parties do not share the same understanding of sustainable  development. Many African States linked poverty with climate  vulnerability, and claimed that development depends on sound  environmental management. Meanwhile, other developing countries,  supported by the US, used poverty eradication as an argument  against new commitments, claiming that development is necessary  for sound environmental management because economic growth  provides financial and technological resources.

The environment/development dichotomy was also present in  discussions on LULUCF under the CDM. At least one Latin American  country made it clear during the high-level round tables that it  considered afforestation and reforestation to be part of its  development plan. Uniting environment and development in this way,  however, was not accepted by all countries. Some claimed that  sinks projects do not represent true development and could  undermine the environmental integrity of the Protocol. As a result,  Parties remained in disagreement at COP-8 over the definitions and  modalities for sinks projects under the CDM.

# CONCLUSION

COP-8 can hardly be considered an overall success, yet it was by  no means a complete failure. While delegates reached agreement on  the Delhi Declaration, it did not dispel the dichotomies. These  are certain to emerge again future negotiations. Moreover,  negotiators failed to provide additional guidance to the Special  Climate Change Fund, and on issues like policies and measures,  trade in cleaner energy and adverse effects, negotiators could not  reach substantive conclusions. These are already on the agenda for  SB-18.

On the positive side, many discussions relating to the  implementation of existing commitments were successful. In  particular, Parties agreed on the rules and procedures for the CDM,  concluded guidelines for reporting and review (Articles 5, 7 and  8), and provided additional guidance to the LDC Fund. These  important steps will further the implementation of both the UNFCCC  and Protocol. Moreover, although the Delhi Declaration did not  initiate a formal dialogue on broadening future commitments,  informal discussions have begun.
