The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)  and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) are expected to  address a range of agenda items, including methodological issues,  such as definitions and modalities for including afforestation and  reforestation activities under Protocol Article 12 (Clean  Development Mechanism), and financial matters relating to non- Annex I Parties under the UNFCCC, including the Special Climate  Change Fund.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  the global environment, with negative impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to a change in the climate. According to  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects  of climate change have already been observed, and a majority of  scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is  necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid 'dangerous  interference' with the climate system. Controlled gases include  methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon dioxide. The  UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994. It now has 188 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, and charged it with reaching agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  (EITs) to achieve quantified emission reduction targets. These  countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to  reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least  5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment  period), with specific targets varying from country to country.  The Protocol also established three mechanisms to assist Annex I  Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively - an  emissions trading system, joint implementation (JI) of emissions- reduction projects between Annex I Parties, and a Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM) that encourages projects in non-Annex  I (developing country) Parties.

At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how countries will cut emissions  and measure and assess emissions reductions. To enter into force,  the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, and by  Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total carbon  dioxide emissions for 1990. To date, 109 Parties have ratified the  Protocol, including 31 Annex I Parties, representing 43.9% of the  emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

In November 1998, Parties met at  COP-4 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and agreed a decision known as  the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The BAPA set COP-6 as the  deadline for reaching agreement on the operational details of the  Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC. Issues  to be addressed include rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime  for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting methods for national  emissions and emissions reductions, and rules on crediting  countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed SB-13 were held in The Hague,  the Netherlands, in November 2000. Positions on the key issues  remained entrenched, with little indication of a willingness to  compromise. During the second week of negotiations, COP-6  President Jan Pronk (the Netherlands) attempted to facilitate  negotiations on the many disputed political and technical issues  by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions. After almost 36  hours of intense talks in the final two days of COP-6, negotiators  could not agree on a range of issues, particularly financial  issues, supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance  and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). On Saturday  afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates  had failed to reach agreement. Delegates agreed to suspend COP-6  and resume negotiations in 2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  Protocol, stating that it considered the Protocol to be 'fatally  flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempt developing  countries from emission reduction targets. Parties reconvened at  COP-6 Part II and SB-14, in July 2001, in Bonn, Germany. After  protracted consultations, President Pronk presented his proposal  for a draft political decision. Despite support from several  Parties, disagreements surfaced over the nature of the compliance  regime. After several days of consultations, ministers agreed to  adopt President Pronk's political decision, with a revised section  on compliance on 25 July 2001. The political decision - or 'Bonn  Agreements' - needed to be operationalized through COP decisions.  These decisions were considered a 'package,' and since no  agreement was reached on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF,  all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates continued discussions on the Bonn Agreements at  COP-7 and SB-15 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10  November 2001. After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on  LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), and  input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was  proposed on 8 November. Although the deal was accepted by most  regional groups, some Annex I Parties, including Australia, Canada,  Japan, New Zealand, and the Russian Federation, did not join the  consensus. They disputed, among other things, eligibility  requirements and credit banking under the mechanisms. However,  following extensive negotiations, the 'Marrakesh Accords' were  agreed, with key features including consideration of LULUCF  Principles and limited banking of units generated by sinks under  the CDM.

### SB-16

Parties met at SB-16 in Bonn from 5-14 June 2002.  Participants considered several issues previously left off the  agenda due to the pressing BAPA negotiations. Views on the  direction of the climate process differed, with some Parties  looking back to recent debates and others looking ahead toward the  next commitment period. Many hoped the Protocol could enter into  force by the WSSD in August 2002. The EU and Japan announced their  Protocol ratifications just prior to the WSSD.

### COP-8

Delegates to COP-8 and SB-17 met from 23 October to 1  November 2002, in New Delhi, India. On the final day of COP-8,  they adopted the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and  Sustainable Development. The Declaration reaffirms development and  poverty eradication as overriding priorities in developing  counties, and recognizes Parties' common but differentiated  responsibilities and national development priorities and  circumstances in the implementation of UNFCCC commitments. Parties  at COP-8 considered institutional and procedural issues under the  Protocol and adopted several decisions, including on the rules and  procedures for the CDM.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### WORKSHOP ON DEFINITIONS AND MODALITIES FOR INCLUDING AFFORESTATION  AND REFORESTATION PROJECT ACTIVITIES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLE 12

This workshop was held from 12-14 February 2003, in Foz do Igua√ßu,  Brazil. In addition to considering issues associated with  afforestation and reforestation in the CDM, the workshop assisted  governments in the preparation of draft text for modalities for  including afforestation and reforestation project activities under  the CDM in the first commitment period. Key themes included non- permanence, baselines, additionality, leakage; socio-economic and  environmental impacts, including impacts on biodiversity and  natural ecosystems; and cross-cutting issues.

### WORKSHOP ON ADJUSTMENTS UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLE 5.2

This workshop  took place from 7-9 April 2003, in Lisbon, Portugal, and assessed  case studies undertaken by the UNFCCC Secretariat for simulating  the calculation of adjustments under Article 5.2. The outcome was  refined draft technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments  under Article 5.2. SBSTA-18 is expected to complete the technical  guidance.

### WORKSHOP ON THE USE OF THE GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION OF NON- ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

This workshop, held in Port Luis,  Mauritius, from 8-11 April 2003, examined the guidelines for the  preparation of non-Annex I national communications agreed at COP-8.  Participants heard a number of presentations on the guidelines,  and other reporting guides and programmes for facilitating the  preparation of non-Annex I national communications.

### WORKSHOP ON ENABLING ENVIRONMENTS FOR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

This  workshop was convened from 9-10 April 2003, in Ghent, Belgium. The  workshop provided an overview of technology transfer, reviewed the  draft technical paper on enabling environments for transfer of  environmentally-sound technology for consideration by the Expert  Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) at its third meeting, and  examined barriers and opportunities to technology transfer.  Working groups discussed ways in which governments could identify  and remove barriers to technology transfer; and how multilateral  lending institutions, bilateral programmes and the private sector  could assist governments.

### WORKSHOPS ON INSURANCE AND RISK ASSESSMENT IN THE CONTEXT OF  CLIMATE CHANGE AND EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS, AND ON INSURANCE- RELATED ACTIONS TO ADDRESS ADVERSE EFFECTS

These two workshops  were held back-to-back from 12-13 May and 14-15 May 2003, in Bonn.  The first workshop heard presentations from reinsurance companies,  researchers and multilateral bodies on the possible roles of  insurance and risk assessment in responding to climate change. The  second workshop focused on insurance-related actions for  addressing the adverse effects of climate change and from the  impact of the implementation of response measures.

### MEETINGS OF CONSTITUTED BODIES

The following UNFCCC constituted  bodies held meetings since COP-8. The LDC Expert Group held its  third meeting from 3-5 March 2003, in Samoa. The CDM Executive  Board held its seventh and eighth meetings in Bonn from 20-21  January 2003 and 20-21 March 2003, respectively. The EGTT held its  third meeting from 30-31 May 2003. In addition, pre-sessional  consultations were held on 2 June to discuss registries, and the  Global Climate Observing System second adequacy report.
