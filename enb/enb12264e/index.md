# SBI

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBI Chair Thomas Becker (Denmark) opened  the session. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter stated  that SBI 22 is an opportunity to complete work on various issues  left unfinished at COP 10, and to address other items, including  improving the intergovernmental process, arrangements for COP 11  and COP/MOP 1, and financial matters.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Delegates discussed the provisional agenda  (FCCC/SBI/2005/1 and Add.1) in detail, particularly additions  proposed by SAUDI ARABIA on implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8  and 4.9 (FCCC/SBI/2005/1/Add.2), and the G-77/CHINA's proposed  agenda item on capacity building.

The EU, CENTRAL GROUP and ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP supported  the agenda without amendments, while the AFRICA GROUP and AOSIS  supported adding an item on capacity building. The UMBRELLA GROUP  opposed Saudi Arabia's proposal and sought more information on the  capacity building proposal. SAUDI ARABIA, NIGERIA, OMAN, EGYPT,  ALGERIA, QATAR, PAKISTAN, KUWAIT, and UNITED ARAB EMIRATES  supported the additions.

Delegates agreed to begin work based on the original provisional  agenda while consultations were held. After consultations, Chair  Becker asked Parties to adopt the provisional supplementary  agenda, with the proposed additional items held in abeyance.  However, no agreement was reached and the matter was left  unresolved.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Submission of Second and, Where  Appropriate, Third National Communications: The Secretariat  explained that talks held during SBI 21 and COP 10 on timelines  for the preparation of national communications from non-Annex I  Parties were not conclusive, and that a draft text  (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.27) had been referred to SBI 22. The EU noted  significant progress on the issue at COP 10 and, with the US,  recommended adopting the draft text. The G-77/CHINA proposed  further informal consultations. Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu  (Mauritius) and Anders Turesson (Sweden) convened informal  consultations.

Work of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE) on Non-Annex I  Communications: CGE Chair Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) reported on  the CGE's activities (FCCC/SBI/2005/7). She described a series of  training workshops on inventories for the Latin America and  Caribbean region and Asia, and on vulnerability assessments for  African countries. REPUBLIC OF KOREA described plans to host a CGE  workshop on mitigation assessment from 26-30 September 2005. The  US invited other Parties to provide financial support for the CGE.  SWITZERLAND noted the potential role of the Secretariat, the UNDP  and UNEP in helping Parties to utilize the knowledge acquired at  CGE workshops. He called for avoidance of duplication of work, the  reinstatement of a budget line for a fourth CGE meeting in the  next biennium, and support from other donors for the national  communications support programme.

###     Compilation and Synthesis of Initial National Communications

The  Secretariat noted inconclusive discussions at SBI 21 and COP 10 on  guidance to the GEF on this issue (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.2 and  FCCC/SBI/2004/L.23). Parties agreed to hold informal  consultations.

###     Provision of Financial and Technical Support

The Secretariat  briefed Parties on this issue (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.1 and INF.3). The  Chair noted that draft conclusions will be prepared in  consultation with interested Parties.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

COP 11 and COP/MOP I:  Secretary of the COP Richard Kinley briefed delegates on  preparations for COP 11 and COP/MOP I in Montreal (FCCC/SBI/2005/4  and Corr.1). AUSTRALIA questioned the need for an agenda item on  UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 at COP 11. SAUDI ARABIA was satisfied  with the current draft agenda. KENYA, AOSIS, TANZANIA and others  raised concerns about visa issues.

###     Future Sessional Periods

Richard Kinley noted an IPCC request to  postpone COP 13 for three or four weeks to avoid it occurring too  soon after the Fourth Assessment Report is finalized. The EU  supported this request, while the US questioned whether it was  necessary.

###     Organization of the Intergovernmental Process

Richard Kinley  noted a recent workshop on ways to improve the organization of the  intergovernmental process (FCCC/SBI/2005/2). Several Parties  commented on the heavy workload at sessional meetings. SWITZERLAND  questioned a proposal to hold intersessional bilateral discussions  on transparency grounds, and supported 'clustering' issues on the  agenda.

###     Observer Organizations in the Convention Process

Richard Kinley  noted ongoing work in the UN on the involvement of civil society.  The US noted that the UN Secretary-General's report on civil  society involvement is still being considered in the General  Assembly. The EU suggested that current UNFCCC practices in this  area are balanced and transparent. Several Parties suggested  taking up this matter in 2007 or 2008. Karsten Sach (Germany) will  chair a contact group on all issues under this agenda item.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Budget Performance for the  Biennium 2004-2005: The Secretariat presented on its financial  situation (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.4), underscoring a funding shortfall.  The Chair will consult informally and develop conclusions.

###     Programme Budget for the Biennium 2006-2007

The EU, opposed by  the US and JAPAN, supported the Secretariat's proposal to  compensate for US dollar depreciation by fixing the budget in  Euros. John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) will chair a contact group.

Implementation of Paragraph 7(c) of the UNFCCC's Financial  Procedures (Financial Support for Participation): The Secretariat  recalled that its practice of withholding funding to Parties from  the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC process if they had  outstanding contributions to the core budget was suspended at the  request of SBI 19. SBI 19 also requested the Secretariat to review  the financial impacts. He explained that some contributing Parties  have introduced their own similar conditions on payment from the  Fund. Draft conclusions will be developed following informal  consultations.

###     Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement

GERMANY and Joke  Waller-Hunter reported on the Headquarters Agreement and progress  on extending it to cover the Kyoto Protocol. Draft conclusions  will be prepared on this matter.

###     Internal Review of the Activities of the Secretariat

Joke  Waller-Hunter reported on an interim review of the Secretariat's  activities (FCCC/SBI/2005/6), noting a lack of resources to meet  demands, and inviting guidance from Parties. Harald Dovland  (Norway) will chair a contact group.

### OTHER MATTERS

Level of Emissions for the Base Year of Croatia:  Chair Becker noted that this issue had been on the agenda for  several years, and hoped it could be resolved at this meeting. The  EU supported CROATIA's proposal for its emissions baselines for  1990, while BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA and SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO  expressed their reservations. Informal consultations will be  chaired by Jim Penman (UK).

###     Climate Neutral UNFCCC Meetings

The US and SAUDI ARABIA opposed a  proposal to offset greenhouse gas emissions from UNFCCC meetings  (FCCC/SBI/2005/9). MICRONESIA and TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO supported  the initiative, and CANADA noted that COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 would  be carbon neutral. Chair Becker said he would develop draft  conclusions.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF): On the  SCCF (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.25), ARGENTINA, SAUDI ARABIA, SOUTH AFRICA  and others expressed disappointment that the matter had not been  resolved at COP 10. The EU noted its support for SCCF, and its  funding pledge on adaptation and technology transfer. BANGLADESH  said LDCs should be able to access the SCCF for adaptation. Emily  Ojoo-Massawa and Jozef Buys (Belgium) will co-chair a contact  group.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9 (ADVERSE EFFECTS)

LDCs: On LDCs, Paul  Desanker (Malawi) briefed delegates on the LDC Expert Group's  April 2005 meeting, noting work on National Adaptation Programmes  of Action (NAPAs) and its links with LDCs' national  communications. Delegates were also briefed by Ricardo Moita  (Portugal) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) on pre-sessional  discussions involving representatives of various Parties and IGOs.  Many parties indicated the need to agree on the operation of the  LDC Fund and to move on to implementation. Several LDCs reported  that they are finalizing their NAPAs. Bubu Pateh Jallow (Gambia)  and Ricardo Moita will chair a contact group to develop draft  conclusions and a draft decision.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### RESEARCH NEEDS RELATING TO THE CONVENTION

Delegates stressed the  IPCC's importance as an independent scientific body, while  underscoring that scientific priorities differ from government  research necessities, and the need for mechanisms to address the  research gap. CHINA and JAPAN highlighted the importance of social  sciences as well as natural sciences. The US said it was difficult  to achieve consensus on research priorities, and the EU proposed  compiling a summary of research needs. Belize, for the G-77/CHINA,  said the mechanism should draw from national contributions. María  Paz Cigarán (Peru) and Sergio Castellari (Italy) will hold  consultations and prepare draft conclusions and a decision.

### CDM AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES

Chair Georg Børsting  (Norway) recalled statements made at SBSTA highlighting broad  agreement on the need to address perverse incentives for new  HCFC-22 plants. CHINA supported coordination between the Montreal  and the Kyoto protocols, but said it should not affect their  separate implementation. Opposed by BRAZIL, he said SBSTA should  provide general rather than technical guidance.

The EU, with BRAZIL, suggested dealing with the problem outside  the CDM. Parties agreed to request the Secretariat to prepare an  options paper, with the CDM Executive Board, based on Parties'  submissions. Delegates will continue informal consultations.

### ADJUSTMENTS FOR LULUCF

Co-Chair Newton Paciornik (Brazil)  reported on an informal group meeting in which delegates had  reviewed the 'conservativeness factor' tables. Delegates discussed  text in the annex of a draft COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 decision  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/2), including on adjustments relating to  overestimation of removals from LULUCF activities. A drafting  group will continue informal consultations.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates met informally to present and  exchange views on the main negotiating groups' written  contributions for draft conclusions and EGTT terms of reference.  Many delegates focused on the issue of publicly-owned and public  domain technologies. Co-Chairs William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana)  and Holger Liptow (Germany) will prepare a compilation text and  continue informal consultations.

### SAFEGUARDING THE OZONE LAYER AND CLIMATE CHANGE - HFCS AND PFCS

Chair Darren Goetze (Canada) invited comments on the joint report  of the IPCC and Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP).  AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and the US praised the report. The UK, for the  EU, suggested a follow up process, including an expert meeting or  workshop. The US and others rejected this proposal, arguing that  the report provided a sound basis for countries to take action.  The US also questioned proposals for a submissions process. Chair  Goetze will prepare draft conclusions by late Saturday morning.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With so many issues being handled in various meetings on Friday,  talk in the corridors ranged widely. Some delegates discussed  financing issues, while others chatted about technology transfer  or praised the upcoming IPCC Guidelines for national greenhouse  gas inventories. Several commented that despite difficulties over  SBI's agenda - which has still to be adopted - the general mood  remained fairly positive.

One issue that seemed to capture delegates' attention was the  Secretariat's proposed budget. An evening presentation filled the  Haydn Room, with participants focusing on the implications of an  option to fix the budget in Euros to address fluctuating exchange  rates. It also emerged that a Secretariat decision to drop a  contingency measure to cover conference services and to rely  instead on the UN General Assembly for future funding could prove  controversial.
