abstract: "The seventeenth session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) was held from 4-6 April 2001, at the headquarters of  the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi, Kenya. Over  200 delegates, experts and representatives of international and  non-governmental organizations attended the session."
---

Participants met in plenary sessions throughout the three-day  meeting. They accepted the actions of the three IPCC Working  Groups with regard to adopting the three sections of the Third  Assessment Report (TAR). They considered progress on the TAR  Synthesis Report, and discussed the future of the IPCC in depth,  focusing on key decisions, including:whether the IPCC should be continued; whether the IPCC should continue to prepare comprehensive  assessments; whether the comprehensive reports should be supplemented by  shorter, more focused special reports on specific issues that  integrate science, impacts, economics and policy options, as in  the Synthesis Report; whether the IPCC should continue to be responsive to the  needs of the UNFCCC, or other environmental conventions (such as  the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention to  Combat Desertification) through the preparation of technical  papers, special reports, or reports on methodological issues; what the appropriate working group structure should be; and what the appropriate size, structure and geographic  representation of the IPCC Bureau might be.

Delegates also considered: activities related to land use, land- use change and forestry (LULUCF); the budget; the future role of  the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; a report by  the Task Force on Climate Scenarios for Impact Assessment; and the  IPCC Communication Strategy.

On the final day of the meeting, participants agreed on a strategy  for further review of the key decisions relating to the future of  the IPCC, and accepted proposals for 'scoping' activities for a  technical report on the links between biological diversity and  climate change, and for a report on sustainable development and  climate change. The next IPCC plenary session will be held from  24-29 September 2001 in London, UK.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was initiated in  1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United  Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The purpose of the IPCC is  to assess the scientific, technical and socioeconomic information  relevant to understanding the risks associated with human-induced  climate change. The IPCC does not undertake new research, nor does  it monitor climate-related data, but bases its assessments on  published and peer reviewed scientific and technical literature.  Its Secretariat is located in Geneva and is staffed by both WMO  and UNEP.

Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of technical  papers, special reports and comprehensive assessments, providing  scientific information on climate change to the international  community, including policy-makers and the general public. This  information has played an important role in the negotiations under  the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC).  The UNFCCC was adopted in 1992 and entered into force  in 1994. It provides the overall policy framework for addressing  climate change.

The current structure of the IPCC includes three Working Groups  and a Task Force.

Working Group I addresses the scientific aspects of the  climate system and climate change.

Working Group II addresses the scientific, technical,  environmental, economic and social aspects of the vulnerability  (sensitivity and adaptability) to climate change, and the negative  and positive consequences (impacts) for ecological systems, socio- economic sectors and human health, with an emphasis on regional  sectoral and cross-sectoral issues.

Working Group III assesses the scientific, technical,  environmental, economic and social aspects of the mitigation of  climate change, as well as the methodological aspects of  crosscutting issues.

The Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories manages  the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme.

The current Bureau of the IPCC was established in 1997, and the  new Bureau is expected to be formed at the IPCC meeting in March  2002. The Bureau has 30 members representing all five UN regions.

### KEY IPCC REPORTS

The IPCC completed its first comprehensive  assessment of climate change compiled in the First Assessment  Report (FAR) in 1990, and its Second Assessment Report (SAR) in  1995. In 1994 it prepared technical guidelines for assessing  greenhouse gas inventories. These were published in 1995 and  subsequently revised in 1996.  The Kyoto Protocol in 1997  reaffirmed the use of the Revised IPCC Guidelines for preparing  national greenhouse gas inventories by the Parties to the UNFCCC.

The IPCC also prepares special reports and technical papers on  topics where independent scientific information and advice is  deemed necessary. It prepared a Special Report on land use, land- use change and forestry (LULUCF) in 2000 at the request of the  UNFCCC.

### THIRD ASSESSMENT REPORT

The Third Assessment Report (TAR)  addresses policy-relevant scientific, technical, and socio- economic dimensions of climate change. It concentrates on findings  since 1995, and pays attention to both regional and global scales,  and includes non-English literature to the extent possible. The  preparation of the TAR was guided by a decision paper that had  been adopted by the Panel at its thirteenth Plenary Session. The  preparation of the TAR has also been guided by papers on cross- cutting issues, such as equity, uncertainties and costing  methodologies, published as IPCC supporting material to ensure a  coordinated approach to these issues within all working groups.

The TAR is composed of a comprehensive assessment from the three  IPCC working groups, and a Synthesis Report. The Synthesis Report,  yet to be completed, will be written in a non-technical style  aimed at policy-makers. It addresses a broad range of key policy- relevant questions identified by the IPCC in consultation with  governments and the Parties of the UNFCCC.

Each working group has also produced a summary for policy makers  and a technical summary. The comprehensive assessments, Synthesis  Report and summaries for policy makers have been subject to  extensive peer review from experts and governments.

### ADOPTION OF THE REPORTS OF THE TAR

Working Group I: Working Group  I met from 17-20 January 2001, in Shanghai, China, to finalize and  adopt its part of the TAR. One hundred and fifty delegates from  100 countries adopted the report, 'Climate Change 2001: The  Scientific Basis' as well as the summary for policy makers. The  report, which is based on work by 123 authors and more than 500  contributors, notes that 'an increasing body of observation gives  a collective picture of a warming world' and that the climate is  changing more rapidly than predicted in the SAR.

Other key findings of the report include that: most of the warming  experienced over the past 50 years is due to human activities;  climate change models have improved; the 1990s was the warmest  decade this century; carbon dioxide concentration in the  atmosphere has increased by 31% since the mid-eighteenth century;  global surface temperature is projected to increase by 1.4 - 5.8Â°C  from 1990 to 2100, which is higher than projected in the SAR;  water vapor concentration and precipitation are projected to  increase, and more intense precipitation events are likely over  many land areas in the mid- to high-latitudes in the northern  hemisphere; and sea-levels are projected to rise by 0.09 - 0.88  meters from 1990 to 2100, which is slightly lower than projected  in the SAR.

Working Group II: Working Group II met from 13-16 February 2001,  in Geneva, Switzerland, to finalize and adopt its part of the TAR.  More than 160 delegates from 100 countries approved the report,  'Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability,' as  well as the summary for policy makers. The full report was  completed by more than 400 authors and contributors, assessing  scientific literature related to the impacts of, and vulnerability  to, climate change. The report suggests projected climate changes  over the next century could potentially lead to future large-scale  and possibly irreversible changes. Focusing on a variety of  issues, the report considers the effects of climate change on  water resources, terrestrial ecosystems and human health. It also  addresses regional concerns, vulnerabilities and adaptive  capacities.

Key findings include an anticipated decline in future agricultural  productivity in large parts of Asia and Africa, water shortages in  a number of regions, harsher droughts in southern Europe, and more  storm damage and coastal erosion on the eastern coast of the US.  The range of infectious diseases, such as malaria, is likely to  increase. Small island States will be most seriously affected,  while developing countries will have the most difficulty in  adapting to climate change.

Working Group III: Working Group III met in Accra, Ghana, from 28  February to 3 March 2001, to finalize and adopt its part of the  TAR. More than 140 delegates from 85 countries approved the  report, 'Climate Change 2001: Mitigation,' as well as the summary  for policy-makers. The report was prepared by nearly 400 authors  and contributors. It assesses options for cutting greenhouse gas  emissions by reviewing: technologies available for controlling  emissions; steps that can be taken in the industry and energy  sectors to promote a transition to a cleaner energy future;  contributions through carbon sequestration by forestry and  agriculture; policies for achieving cost-effective and 'no- regrets' emissions reductions; and ways to overcome political,  cultural and institutional barriers to mitigation.

The report confirms that many cost-effective solutions to limit  greenhouse gas emissions do exist, although there often are  institutional, behavioral and other barriers to their  implementation. The choice of energy sources and investment in the  energy sector are highlighted as determining future climatic  development. The report notes that, while more progress is needed,  technological change with regard to climate-friendly energy  production and greenhouse gas reduction has taken place more  rapidly than anticipated five years ago.

The report further highlights end-use energy efficiency as an  important component of mitigation efforts as it could account for  half of the potential emissions reductions from 2010-2020. The  potential of so-called 'no-regrets' mitigation options in which  emissions are reduced while money is saved is stressed. If reduced  air pollution and other ancillary benefits are considered, the  benefits are even greater. However, in order for mitigation  measures to be carried out, socio-economic and institutional  changes are required and political will is needed.

# REPORT OF THE MEETING

IPCC Chair Robert Watson opened the seventeenth Panel session on  Wednesday morning, 4 April. After welcoming participants, he  highlighted the importance of the meeting, and said it would  accept the actions taken by the three IPCC Working Groups with  regard to the Third Assessment Report (TAR). He noted that each  section of the TAR had already been approved by each respective  Working Group. He then said the meeting would discuss the future  of the IPCC. He asked participants to first consider whether there  should be a future role for the IPCC, and if so, what the scope  and the structure of the IPCC should be. He introduced a paper he  had written on this issue, which would form the basis for in-depth  discussions during the meeting. He said participants would  consider whether the IPCC was being responsive to the United  Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and other  entities in the environment and development field. He then noted  that the draft Synthesis Report of the TAR would be distributed  during the meeting. He said that it had been sent out to  governments for review, was being translated into all six UN  languages, and would be approved by the eighteenth IPCC Plenary  session, to be held in London, United Kingdom, in September 2001.

Godwin Obasi, Secretary-General of the WMO, thanked UNEP for  hosting the meeting. He recalled achievements of the IPCC to date  and provided his perspective of the TAR. He said the TAR: was more  definitive in attributing most observed climate change to human  activities; called attention to trends in climate variables in  addition to temperature; noted that ecosystems and human systems  are vulnerable to climate change, with the poor likely to be most  hard hit; showed that climate change mitigation policies have  potential synergies with policies that promote sustainable  development and equity; and noted that human actions influence the  future climate of the planet. He called for action to address the  challenge of climate change under the UNFCCC. He also noted the  importance of collection, distribution, exchange and archiving of  information related to the global climate, and the need for  resources in order to reverse the decline in observational  networks and to improve climate modeling. On the future work of  the IPCC, he suggested that the Panel should consider converting  the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories into a  working group. He assured the support of the WMO for the IPCC.

Klaus TÃ¶pfer, Executive Director of UNEP, welcomed participants to  Nairobi. He congratulated the IPCC on its work, and emphasized the  importance of its continuation. He highlighted a decision from the  UNEP Governing Council meeting held in Nairobi from 5-9 February  2001, which urged the continuation of support for the IPCC and the  participation of as many experts as possible from developing  countries, and which called for UNEP to disseminate the findings  of the TAR. He recalled the key message of Working Group I, that  new and stronger evidence is available to indicate that the  warming that has been observed could be attributed to human  activities. He noted that Working Group II indicated that  carefully planned adaptation measures could significantly reduce  the impacts of climate change. He underscored that in this manner  the IPCC does not only identify the problems, but also provides  guidance toward solutions. He said Working Group III demonstrated  the importance of focusing on bottlenecks in order to overcome  them. He concluded that scientific, not politically biased, views  should be the outcome of the work of the IPCC.

Michael Zammit Cutajar, Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, made  his last statement to the Plenary of the IPCC in his current  capacity. He underscored that the three assessment reports and the  special reports are the 'bible of climate science,' and noted that  the work of the IPCC provides hope that all governments will  recognize the importance of climate change. He outlined his  recommendations that the future work of the IPCC should: maintain  the rhythm of publication of the assessment reports every five  years and the current format for reporting; ensure integration of  scientific assessments with environment and development issues and  cooperation between conventions; and explore ways to better  communicate the information to governments and the general public.  He confirmed that the resumed session of the UNFCCC Sixth  Conference of the Parties (COP-6) would be held from16-27 July  2001. He noted his wish that the IPCC would be able to identify a  scientifically sound indicator of climate change that world public  opinion would immediately grasp.

Renate Christ, Deputy Secretary of the IPCC, on behalf of the IPCC  Secretariat, thanked UNEP for the hosting this meeting.  Participants then adopted the provisional annotated agenda.

## ADOPTION OF THE DRAFT REPORT OF THE SIXTEENTH SESSION

Under this agenda item, participants commented that the report did  not reflect the length of the discussions during the sixteenth  IPCC Plenary session in Montreal, Canada. They noted that the  terms of reference for the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas  Inventories approved at the sixteenth session were only the  interim terms of reference, since the final ones would be  discussed at this seventeenth session. The draft report was then  adopted.

## ACCEPTANCE OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE IPCC WORKING GROUPS IN  RELATION TO THE TAR

Participants considered this agenda item on Wednesday, 4 April,  and Thursday, 5 April. They accepted the summaires for policy  makers (SPMs) and took note of supporting material, including the  Working Group Technical Summaries and the lists of relevant  corrections and edits that had been made to the TAR, after the  SPMs had been adopted, to ensure consistency with the SPMs. This  material was distributed in hard copy at the meeting.

Working Group I Co-Chair Yihui Ding presented a brief summary  describing the progress of work on the report prepared by the  group. He said the SPM and the underlying assessment had been  approved in Shanghai, China, during the eighth session of Working  Group I from 17-20 January 2001. He noted that the documents had  included the comments received by reviewers, and that these  comments had been carefully analyzed and assimilated into the  revised documents. Before the Plenary accepted the documents, one  participant, seeking to avoid misunderstanding, requested the  inclusion in the report of a clear explanation of the reason for  the difference in projected temperature change between the  findings in this report and previous findings. This request was  noted in the minutes of the meeting, since no changes could be  made to the SPM adopted by the Working Group.

Working Group II Co-Chair James McCarthy reported on the work of  the group. He noted the participation of over 400 authors and  reviewers for the preparation of the report. He said that the  comments by governments and reviewers had been taken into account  in Geneva, Switzerland, on 13-16 February 2001, and were reflected  in the technical summary and the SPM. Delegates agreed to include  in the minutes two notes that address issues that had been omitted  in the report. One note would mention that 'small island States'  should be changed to 'small island developing States' to reflect  the text used in the UNFCCC. The other note would state that  'several delegates noted that Working Group II did not address the  level of greenhouse gas concentrations that would cause dangerous  anthropogenic perturbation to the climate system (the ultimate  goal of the UNFCCC).' Working Group III Co-Chair Ogunlade Davidson reported on the work  of the group. He noted that the Working Group had met in Accra,  Ghana, from 28 February to 3 March 2001 and adopted its part of  the TAR.

The Plenary accepted the action taken by the Working Groups on the  TAR.

## PROGRESS ON THE SYNTHESIS REPORT

Chair Watson reported that the IPCC Secretariat had distributed  the draft Synthesis Report to governments and experts by mail on 3  April 2001. The report would also be available in hard copy during  the Plenary meeting, and is accessible to governments on a closed  website. The writing team for the Synthesis Report is composed of  members of the IPCC Bureau, Coordinating Lead Authors from each  Working Group, and selected members from each Working Group. The  comments are expected to be returned in English within eight  weeks. The SPM will be approved line-by-line and the Synthesis  Report will be adopted section-by-section at the eighteenth IPCC  Plenary session in September.

The Plenary took note of this agenda item.

## POST TAR WORK PROGRAMME

Participants discussed the future work programme of the IPCC  during all three days of the IPCC session. The Panel started  discussing the issue on Wednesday afternoon, 4 April. In his  introduction, Chair Watson noted that the TAR was nearly complete,  and that it was timely to discuss future work. He highlighted his  paper on the future work of the IPCC, noting that the UNEP  Governing Council had strongly endorsed the IPCC, and said that a  similar discussion would be needed within the WMO. He provided a  historical context of the IPCC and highlighted its current  structure and work. He stressed that part of the work of the IPCC  can be considered risk assessment - notably that of Working Groups  I and II - while the work of Working Group III, as well as work on  adaptation, can be considered risk management. He noted that the  risk management work ran a greater risk of being politicized, and  called for caution.

In a general discussion, participants raised issues relating to:  the length of the documents; transparency between the work of the  IPCC Bureau and the Plenary; the role and scope of the working  groups; the relationship between the IPCC and environmental  conventions; and the importance of encouraging a greater number of  experts from developing countries to participate in the process.

On the continuation of the IPCC, most participants expressed their  support for the IPCC to continue its work, and several raised the  point that this decision lay with the founding organizations of  the IPCC, UNEP and WMO. Some delegates noted that the IPCC should  remain an objective and independent technical body. One  participant suggested the IPCC should stop to critically evaluate  its own activities.

On general directions for the future, one participant stressed the  need to build on strengths, based on accumulated experience. He  also said the IPCC should be an initiator of new action and  research. One delegate called for the consideration of a more  regional focus of work, such as in the area of mitigation. Several  participants drew attention to funding issues, noting that a  strong budget is required for the IPCC to continue its work at  current levels. On the need to ensure more focused work, one  participant cautioned against policy prescription. He stressed  that the IPCC should continue its work regardless of what is  happening in the UNFCCC process, and proposed that the IPCC itself  drive its agenda.

Many delegates noted the need to fully take into account research  and literature from the South, and to do more to involve  developing countries and to make use of literature in languages  other than English. The Working Group Co-Chairs explained that  they had tried to involve developing country representatives and  stressed the need to make further efforts with regard to this  issue.

Summarizing the general discussion, Chair Watson noted that all  interventions seemed to support the continuation of the IPCC. He  noted improved developing country participation as an operational  issue that should receive further attention. He highlighted a new  US$7.5 million grant to be used by developing country scientists  to work on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation. He highlighted  the need to improve access to research in foreign languages, and  to improve ways of finding such literature.

On the need for increasing transparency with regard to the Bureau,  he suggested distributing the agenda in advance and the minutes as  soon as they were approved. He noted that the real decisions are  taken by the Plenary and that the Bureau can only make  recommendations.

## Key decisions related to the future work of the IPCC:

Chair Watson  introduced ten key decisions on the future of the IPCC and  outlined his perspectives on them. On whether the IPCC should  continue preparing comprehensive assessments (Decision 1), he  recommended it should. On how frequent the comprehensive  assessments should be (Decision 2), he said either the five-year  interval should be maintained or the intervals should be made  longer, but the issue should be discussed in plenary and with the  expert community. On whether the reports by the different working  groups relating to the comprehensive assessments should be  staggered (Decision 3), he said the delays would have to be  sufficiently long to provide benefits and said that this would  make preparing a Synthesis Report difficult. He supported shorter  and more focused working group reports (Decision 4). On whether  the comprehensive reports should be supplemented by special  reports, such as the Synthesis Report (Decision 5), he strongly  supported a series of focused special reports. On how to manage  and approve technical papers, special reports and reports on  methodological issues (Decision 6), he said a series of options  should be explored. On whether the IPCC should prepare papers and  reports on request of the UNFCCC and other environmental  conventions (Decision 7), he said the IPCC should be responsive as  long as financial resources are available and the scope is  appropriate, as judged by the Panel. On whether current procedures  should apply for all special reports or there should be exceptions  to respond to the short-term needs of the Parties to the UNFCCC  and the Kyoto Protocol (Decision 8), he said case-by-case  decisions could be taken by the Panel on just one round of peer  review for a specific special report. On the appropriate Working  Group structure (Decision 9), he supported the current structure,  but recommended increased attention to cross-cutting issues and a  fourth working group on the inventories' methodological work. On  the appropriate size, structure and geographic representation of  the IPCC Bureau (Decision 10), he recommended that the size of the  Bureau remain at 30 members, with current geographical  representation. He recommended four working groups with seven- member bureaus and two co-chairs from a developed and a developing  country or a country with economy in transition.

Participants began focused discussions on the decisions on  Wednesday, 4 April, continued discussions much of Thursday, and  concluded them on Friday.

### Decision 1:

Several participants noted that the decision on the  continuation of comprehensive assessments and special reports can  be regarded as one, and that both types of reports are needed, and  that a balance should be maintained between the different sets of  reports. One delegate stressed that the SPMs were too long, and  that the technical summaries are unnecessary. Another delegate  noted that new technologies such as CD-ROM should be utilized for  the distribution of the IPCC material, in particular the  comprehensive assessments. Participants agreed that the  comprehensive assessments should be continued, although they  generally felt that they could be both comprehensive and more  focused at the same time, and thus shorter.

### Decision 2:

On the intervals between the comprehensive  assessments, some countries favored longer intervals in order to  have more new information to build on. One delegate suggested a  10-year interval with a supplement every five years with updates.  Other participants supported maintaining the cycle at five years,  noting that research is taking place at an accelerated speed. One  participant wanted the interval to be shorter than five years.  Several participants noted a sense of fatigue among scientists  both with regard to the number of reports and the timing of the  next assessment. Stressing that the supply of a high quality  product must be ensured, one delegate said a new assessment should  be should be issued only when there is something new to report,  and suggested the scientists should be consulted about the  timeframe.

Chair Watson suggested that the timeframe would partly be  determined by the amount of new material appearing in the near  future, but also by the new Bureau.

### Decision 3:

The issue of whether the working groups should be  staggered is an item for the new Bureau to decide.

### Decision 4:

Many participants supported shorter reports and SPMs.  Chair Watson said this would be left to the new Bureau to  determine.

### Decision 5:

Participants underscored that uncertainties identified  in the preparation of the assessment reports could be addressed by  focused special reports. Delegates suggested that the special  reports could address important issues so that the comprehensive  assessment reports could be shorter. One participant noted that  not only technical papers are needed, but that guidelines and  methodological reports are also necessary.

### Decision 6:

On the management and approval process for special  reports, several delegates preferred the option used most  frequently to date, which involved the reports being assigned to  the most appropriate working group co-chairs and associated  Technical Support Units, with approval in a plenary session of the  working group. One participant suggested making better use of the  Synthesis Report for the purpose of focusing the work in the  working groups, and for identifying what the special reports  should cover. Participants discussed the role of the working group  co-chairs and IPCC vice-chairs in managing special reports.  Concerns were raised regarding the workload for these individuals.  Participants questioned how crosscutting issues that do not fit  clearly within one working group should be approached.

Chair Watson noted a slight variation of viewpoints, but  recognized that many supported the idea that the normal procedure  would entail using existing co-chairs with existing Technical  Support Units, especially when associated with the subject of the  working group. It was suggested that, if the issues are cross- cutting, with inputs from all, then a special vice-chair with the  support of either a Technical Support Unit or special arrangements  on a case-by-case basis should be made. Chair Watson noted that  most delegates agreed that there should not be changes to existing  rules of procedure, but that an addenda on the acceptance process  for methodological work should be added. He suggested the task  force bureau should come up with an options paper for this. He  also supported an addenda on the interface between the Bureau and  the Panel.

### Decision 7:

The fact that the IPCC had been requested to prepare a  technical paper for a convention other than the UNFCCC was  considered to indicate the success of the IPCC, and also to  provide a challenge for the IPCC. While requests from the UNFCCC  to carry out work were supported, some delegates noted that such  requests from other bodies should only be met if the focus of the  work remained on climate change, although there was general  agreement that there are distinct inter-linkages between the  various environmental conventions. Several delegates stressed the  importance of setting overall priorities. One participant said the  IPCC should decide on its own priorities with regard to which  links to focus on, and not depend on requests from other bodies.  Many countries noted that synergies and complementarities need to  be explored further, but recognized that funds are an issue.  Delegates also expressed concern that any joint work with another  convention or body should be done with the understanding that the  IPCC follow its agreed rules.

One participant stressed that work requested by other bodies  should be carefully defined, and that the effort should be joint  and involve both bodies. Another participant recalled that IPCC  efforts rely on voluntary contributions and suggested that  scientists will be fatigued if there are too many requests.

### Decision 8:

On whether current procedures should apply for all  special reports, or that exceptions be made to respond to the  short-term needs of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Kyoto  Protocol, one delegate said that rules may need to be reconsidered  with regard to methodological guidelines, especially if the Task  Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories becomes a new working  group. Some delegates said the present procedures should not be  revised, and that additional procedures should be provided where  not available. Participants agreed that altering the two-tier  review process was not desired, and underscored that it was  important for the credibility of the IPCC. Chair Watson noted that  the approval process for inventories now is unclear, and said that  a plan for this needs to have an addenda regarding methodological  guidelines.

### Decision 9:

On the structure of the three working groups, one  delegate said their work should be better integrated, and that  lessons could be learned from work on cross-cutting issues under  the TAR. Participants also raised the issue of addressing the  interactions between the working groups. Several participants  expressed the desire to maintain the number of vice-chairs, and  suggested concrete responsibilities for these roles, such as  leading task forces for special reports, doing budgetary work or  covering communication.  It was suggested that the economic  aspects of Working Group II, and the technical aspects of Working  Group III should be strengthened.

General support for a fourth working group on greenhouse gas  inventories was expressed, although with various concerns about  the nature of the work of this group. One participant called for  transparent procedures and noted that making the Task Force a  working group would add to transparency. Participants' concerns  regarding the proposed fourth working group related to the  importance of avoiding the creation of a policy prescriptive  group, as this working group would focus on demands set by the  UNFCCC. The need to ensure a transparent and policy neutral  process within the working group was encouraged.

### Decision 10:

Several delegates supported the continuation of the  current structure of the Bureau. Some participants called for more  transparency in the selection of the Bureau. Noting that the  current composition is based on regional representation, one  participant questioned whether the Bureau members actually  consulted with their constituencies, and suggested that by doing  so, all delegates would feel a greater sense of ownership with  regard to actions by the Bureau. Participants expressed differing  views on the size of the Bureau, ranging from suggestions to  expand it, to reduce the members, and to have a rotating  membership basis. Participants highlighted the need for a regional  balance within the bureaus of each working group.

### Conclusion:

In concluding, Chair Watson summarized the views  expressed by participants. On the question of whether the IPCC  should be continued, he said agreement had been unanimous,  although some participants had expressed that this decision was  not up to the Panel, but rather up to its founding bodies, UNEP  and WMO.  On the question of whether the IPCC should continue to  prepare comprehensive assessments, general accord was articulated,  but delegates expressed desire for attempting to focus and shorten  the assessments. The question of special reports was unanimously  supported, as was the issue of taking on requests for such work by  the UNFCCC. However there was concern and differing views for  taking up requests from other conventions and bodies. Regarding  the question of whether a fourth working group should be  established to deal with inventory issues, participants  articulated views in favor, but also indicated reservations, and  several noted that the time was not right to make a decision on  this. Participants agreed that there was a need to determine the  structure of the body focusing on inventories in order to ensure  transparency and credibility, and to decide on the approval  process within this body. On the composition of the Bureau,  delegates agreed that the regional balance should be maintained.  With certain concerns expressed, participants mostly agreed that  the current size of the Bureau was satisfactory.

Noting general agreement on all major issues in the paper, Chair  Watson agreed to rewrite his paper on the future work programme of  the IPCC based on the discussions. He would then send it out for  comments within four weeks, and prepare a third version four weeks  later based on comments received. All delegates would receive the  third version prior to the IPCC meeting in September 2001.

### Consideration of a Request for a technical paper on the  interlinkages between climate change and biological diversity:

This agenda item was addressed on Wednesday, 4 April. Chair Watson  highlighted an invitation from the sixth meeting of the Subsidiary  Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA-6)  of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), held in Montreal,  Canada, from 12-16 March 2001, for the IPCC to contribute to an  assessment of the interlinkages between biological diversity and  climate change by preparing a technical paper and identifying  experts. He noted that the IPCC had addressed these issues in its  Special Report on LULUCF as well as in other documents, and that  the process would be joint, but follow IPCC procedures. He said a  technical paper could possibly be completed within a year to a  year-and-a-half, though the IPCC could also consider a longer  special report.

While participants generally agreed that there are interlinkages  between many of the environmental conventions and bodies,  different views were expressed on the way to proceed regarding the  request. Many delegates responded favorably, noting the close  relationship between the two conventions and the amount of  information now available in the TAR and the LULUCF report. One  delegate called for a scoping paper and final decision in  September, while another pointed out that it is important for the  IPCC to seize the opportunity to set the agenda rather than having  other similar bodies created to deal with climate change linkages  with other issues. One delegate supported a short technical paper  being issued in a short time period based on the LULUCF Special  Report and the TAR.

Some delegates stressed that work requested by the UNFCCC should  take priority, and highlighted scarce resources. Some delegates  requested that the issue be considered as one within a list of  options for future IPCC work. One participant proposed that this  request be discussed in the UNFCCC SBSTA or COP, and cautioned  that there may be political underpinnings to the request and  warned against making the report policy prescriptive. Other  delegates disagreed with this point, and the Chair said that the  paper would provide a neutral scientific basis as a platform for  cooperation in the areas of climate change and biological  diversity.

Delegates underscored the need to maintain IPCC rules and  procedures should the request be taken up. Participants stressed  that demonstrating the linkages between climate change and  biodiversity to policy-makers would indicate the importance of  mitigation measures for addressing climate change. Concerns  included whether the scale on which ecosystems are studied was  compatible with the scale on which climate is studied, and whether  addressing this request would contribute to politicizing the role  of the IPCC. Participants stressed the need for a plan of action  to identify priorities.

Some delegates said the SAR, TAR and Special Reports already  prepared by the IPCC contained adequate information on the  linkages between climate change and biodiversity to address the  request, but Working Group II Co-Chair James McCarthy pointed out  that the information in these reports was limited. IPCC Chair  Watson underscored that the work required to fulfill the request  was minor, and suggested that participants agree on a scoping  paper. The paper would indicate the sources from which the  information would be drawn, and contain a list of recommended lead  authors and coordinating lead authors. He added that the paper  would be addressed at the next Plenary meeting of the IPCC.

### IPCC Work Programme and Budget for 2002-2004:

Leo Meyer, Co-Chair  of the Financial Task Team, introduced the agenda item on the  budget on Friday, 6 April. He noted that the current budgetary  situation was stable, and that one country had committed to  substantially increased contributions. He mentioned that the WMO  had submitted an analysis on IPCC financial matters, and suggested  measures that should be taken to improve financial reporting and  transparency. He called attention to high shipping and mailing  costs. He noted that the budget proposal for 2002 was still in  draft form, and that there were no certain figures for the post- TAR period, since the work programme remains to be agreed upon. In  the ensuing discussion, the need to ensure that the IPCC stays on  a sound financial basis was brought up, and the need to broaden  the budgetary base was underscored, as the funding situation is  likely to change in the future. Some participants expressed  concern over the uncertainty with regard to funding.

### Task Force on Climate Scenarios for Impact Assessment:

This agenda  item was considered on Friday morning, 6 April. Chair Watson  introduced a report by the Task Force on Climate Scenarios for  Impact Assessment. The Task Force was established to facilitate  cooperation and promote collaboration between the climate modeling  and impacts communities, particularly addressing issues related to  availability and accessibility of climate scenarios and other data  for use in impacts studies and assessment. The outputs of the Task  Force are: the maintenance of the IPCC Data Distribution Centre  managed by the Climatic Research Unit in the UK, and the Deutsches  Klimarechenzentrum in Germany; guidance material on the use of  scenario data for impact and adaptation assessments; and the  publication of inventories. Chair Watson outlined the next steps  for the Task Force, including:considering the choice of scenarios that reflect the  operation of various mitigation strategies; summarizing current knowledge regarding the scaling of  atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) results and  making these available to impacts researchers so that impact  assessments are more representative of the full range of possible  future climates; improving the inter-comparison of regional models, to ensure  that regional-level impact assessments are a more feasible  objective of the IPCC's assessments in the future; liaising with other organizations, regarding the development  of programmes for training in the use of scenarios for climate  impact assessment; and enabling the regular updating of the IPCC Data Distribution  Centre, the guidance material on scenario use and the inventories  of the AOGCM studies, regional models, and impacts studies.

One delegate highlighted that the IPCC should recognize the  importance of climate data, which should be good, reliable,  homogenized and of long enough series for the preparation of  scenarios.

### LULUCF in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, including terms of  reference for the Task Force:

This item was considered on Friday,  6 April. Chair Watson introduced a draft Panel decision on how to  move forward on LULUCF in the context of national greenhouse gas  inventories, produced by the bureau of the Task Force on National  Greenhouse Gas Inventories. After making a few minor textual  changes, delegates accepted the decision text that:notes the previous request by the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for  Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to the IPCC to  progress activities related to good practice guidance and  uncertainty management for the LULUCF sector of national  greenhouse gas inventories; notes that the current report on Good Practice Guidance and  Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories  covers all sectors except for LULUCF; decides to further pursue work on elaborating such guidance  to meet the inventory reporting requirements to Parties under the  UNFCCC relating to LULUCF; notes that the IPCC will take into account possible guidance  from the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties; requests the Task Force bureau to organize the work; and decides to consider the proposed work programme at the IPCC's  eighteenth session.

On the terms of reference for the Task Force on National  Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chair Watson suggested that the Task  Force prepare a short paper that will address, inter alia, the  various options available to answer the question of whether the  Task Force should be modified into a new working group or remain a  task force; what the structure of such a working group or task  force should be; what the focus of such a working group or task  force should be; and how such a working group or task force should  relate to the other working groups and the IPCC as a whole.

### IPCC Communication Strategy:

This agenda item was addressed at the  end of the day on Thursday, 5 April. Rajendra Pachauri, Chair of  the Ad Hoc Group on Communication Strategy, gave a presentation on  the development and use of the IPCC website, noting a rapid rise  in the number of hits. He noted seminars and workshops held and  called for further outreach to disseminate information on the work  of the IPCC.

One delegate requested that the material on the IPCC website,  especially the TAR SPMs, be made available in all UN languages.

### Scoping for a special report on key interactions between climate  change and sustainable development:

On Thursday evening, 5 April,  a proposal was introduced for a special report on climate change  and sustainable development addressing key interactions, as well  as a proposal for a scoping/expert meeting to prepare the ground  for this special report. The report would, inter alia, specify  clearly the criteria for sustainable development with regard to  climate change, and consider impacts on poverty and equity as well  as implications on a regional basis.

Discussion of the proposal took place on Friday morning, 6 April.  Chair Watson asked for comments on whether the IPCC should approve  a scoping meeting prior to its eighteenth session in September, at  which the decision on the special report then could be taken.

Many delegates expressed their support both for the proposed  special report and a scoping meeting. Some delegates underscored  that issues of sustainable development and equity had not been  comprehensively dealt with in the TAR, and welcomed additional  efforts. They also stressed that climate change and sustainable  development need to be integrated into policies at the national  level, which the special report could support. Some delegates  noted that the focus on sustainable development would be timely  considering the upcoming World Summit on Sustainable Development  in Johannesburg, South Africa, in 2002. One delegate called for a  focus on the social aspects of sustainable development, and  cautioned against the report becoming political, stressing the  need for it to be a scientific assessment. Some delegates  underscored the need for the process to include representatives  from all geographical regions. One participant noted that while  there is much ongoing work on sustainable development, there is  usually not a strong focus on climate change in this context.

Some delegates expressed concern regarding the fact that this  issue was being discussed before the overall work programme and  priorities for the IPCC had been decided on. Some participants  cautioned that the proposed report might be too wide in scope,  arguing for a more focused approach. Several delegates called for  attention to financial requirements, and requested time for  national consultations.

Noting that the majority of delegates support the scoping meeting,  Chair Watson proposed that the work go ahead with a scoping  meeting and a scoping paper including different options to be made  available to IPCC members four weeks in advance of the September  session. The focus would be on the environmental, not political  dimension of the issue, and there would be a study of similar  ongoing work. A timetable and assessment of budgetary implications  would be included, and the meeting would ensure good regional  representation. The Panel agreed with this proposal.

### Critical areas of priority for future IPCC work:

A one-hour  discussion on this topic was held on Friday, 6 April. Chair Watson  requested participants to highlight critical areas that should be  priorities for the future work of the IPCC, underscoring that  these areas would be ones for which the IPCC could stimulate  research within the academic community, since the IPCC itself does  not carry out research. He suggested that these critical elements  could become crucial components of the next comprehensive  assessment, or the topic of special reports. Delegates suggested  that the IPCC address the following issues/tasks:an economic assessment of the damage resulting from climate  change and the cost of measures that are necessary to prevent this  damage; the point at which greenhouse gas concentration levels become  'dangerous;' critical elements and critical threshold levels of the  climate system; research on the carbon cycle, including the negative and  positive role of carbon dioxide for the biosphere and the climate  system; the correlation between theoretical and experimental global  surface data; the links between climate change and sustainable development  and biodiversity; local and short-range weather events and the potential link  to climate change; links between climate change and extreme weather events,  including El NiÃ±o, tropical cyclones and monsoons; a comparison of the cost of action versus the cost of  inaction; documentation of climate change events and impacts that have  been evident to date and detection of climate change; development of methodologies for assessing the likelihood of  emissions scenarios and economic assessment of emissions  scenarios; vulnerability and adaptation assessments and identification  of adaptation strategies; focus on regional level implications and improving the  sensitivity of climate models at the regional level; impact of mitigation measures on developing countries and  costs of mitigation measures; and data requirements and homogeneity of data, especially from  and in the South.

Chair Watson said that he would summarize the elements and link  them with what had been presented on these issues in the TAR and  Synthesis Report. The results would be submitted to participants  for comment within four weeks.

### IPCC-UNFCCC Interaction:

Reporting on the outcome of a joint  working group session between the IPCC and the UNFCCC, Chair  Watson noted that several issues that were of interest to the IPCC  had been identified, some of which required inputs from the IPCC.  These issues included: that the UNFCCC and CBD Secretariats had  formed a liaison for working closely on interrelated issues; that  the UNFCCC had requested Working Group II to nominate some experts  to be invited to a workshop on impact and adaptation measures; and  that the UNFCCC had requested some experts to participate in a  workshop on the Brazil Proposal on differentiated emissions  reduction targets for Parties according to the impact of their  historic emissions on temperature rise. One delegation asked  whether the published products of the TAR would be available  before the resumed session of UNFCCC COP-6, and Chair Watson  confirmed that they would be, as would the SPMs and Technical  Summaries, both of which would be available in all UN languages.

Chair Watson noted that the IPCC had been requested to deliver a  short presentation at the beginning of the resumed COP-6, and  would convene side events on the key results of the TAR during  that meeting. The IPCC would give a formal presentation on the  Synthesis Report during a SBSTA session at COP-7.

## ISSUES RELATED TO THE EIGHTEENTH SESSION OTHER THAN THE SYNTHESIS  REPORT

This agenda item was briefly addressed on Friday afternoon, 6  April. Participants discussed how to address other business during  the upcoming eighteenth session, which is dedicated to approving  and adopting the Synthesis Report. Several delegates commented  that there would not be sufficient time during the scheduled six- day meeting to reach conclusion on the key decisions that had been  addressed during this session, and also to approve the proposed  scoping paper on the request from the CBD for a technical paper on  the links between biological diversity and climate change. Other  items that would need to be addressed included a proposed paper on  the future role of the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas  Inventories, the budget, and LULUCF activity.

## OTHER BUSINESS AND CLOSING OF THE SESSION

During the Plenary session on Friday afternoon, 6 April, a  representative of the Ozone Secretariat highlighted successful  examples of cooperation between the scientific assessment panel  for ozone and the IPCC, and encouraged further collaboration.

Chair Watson introduced the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment in  support of the conventions on biological diversity and  desertification and the Ramsar Convention on wetlands. He noted  that the Assessment would be launched in mid-April 2001. He said  he would keep the IPCC members informed on developments within  this programme, and stressed that there are links between it and  the IPCC's work.

In closing, Chair Watson reviewed the follow-up actions to the  IPCC meeting, noted the time and location of the eighteenth  session, and welcomed suggestions for the nineteenth session. He  noted that the report of the seventeenth meeting would be approved  at the September meeting. Thanking the participants, he closed the  meeting at 4:45 pm.
