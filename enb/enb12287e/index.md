# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### ADAPTATION

Consultations convened by Helen Plume (New Zealand)  and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) resumed on the SBSTA  five year programme of work on adaptation, with informal  discussions still continuing as of 11:45 pm.

### ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS

Privileges  and Immunities for Individuals Serving on Constituted Bodies under  the Kyoto Protocol: Contact group Chair Masao Nakayama  (Micronesia) requested comments from Parties. Nigeria, for the  G-77/CHINA, proposed giving the matter further consideration at  SBI 24. The EU agreed, and suggested additional text requesting  the UNFCCC Executive Secretary to liaise with the UN  Secretary-General on this prior to SBI 24. While the G-77/CHINA  expressed concerns that SBI's future consideration should not be  pre-determined by other work, a compromise text was eventually  formulated. The agreed text asks SBI 24 to consider this issue  and requests submissions by 13 February 2006. It also requests  the UNFCCC Executive Secretary to consult with the UN  Secretary-General on ensuring the necessary privileges and  immunities, and to report to SBI 24. NIGERIA said he would take  this text back to the G-77/China for its consideration, and that  if the Group agreed to the text, then the conclusions could be  approved without the need for a further meeting.

### ARTICLE 3.9 (FUTURE COMMITMENTS)

Delegates convened in the  evening for further informal consultations. The meeting was held  in a small group setting and involved only delegates from several  Parties and country groups. As of 11:45 pm, negotiations were  ongoing and progress was slow.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

The group met informally in the afternoon and  late into the night. Discussions were still continuing as of  11:45 pm.

### CDM IMPLICATIONS FOR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES

Parties agreed  to a draft COP/MOP decision and draft SBSTA conclusions presented  by Chair Georg Børsting (Norway) on the implications of the  establishment of new HCFC-22 facilities seeking to obtain CERs for  the destruction of HFC-23. The draft decision includes a  definition of new HCFC-22 facilities, recognizes that issuing CERs  for HFC-23 destruction could lead to higher global production of  HCFC-22 and/or HFC-23, and encourages Annex I Parties and  multilateral financial institutions to provide funding for  destruction of HFC-23 in non-Annex I Parties. The decision also  requests SBSTA to continue deliberations on the issue with a view  to preparing a draft recommendation with guidance to the CDM  Executive Board for adoption at COP/MOP 2.

### COMPLIANCE

Parties met for informal consultations on the adoption  of the compliance mechanism and Saudi Arabia's proposal to amend  the Protocol. Delegates had received a revised draft decision from  Co-Chairs Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso) and Harald Dovland  (Norway) on Sunday, and negotiations continued on Monday morning.  In the evening, the Co-Chairs provided a new proposal based on  input from both developed and developing countries that included  two key paragraphs on adopting the compliance mechanism at COP/MOP  1, and consideration of the amendment process. Differences  remained on whether there is a need to amend the Protocol as  proposed by Saudi Arabia. Informal consultations will continue on  Tuesday, when the Co-Chairs will provide a new proposal.

### DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Chair Hernán Carlino  (Argentina) presented draft conclusions. Papua New Guinea, for the  G-77/CHINA and supported by many Parties, stressed the need to  address both technical and policy aspects of this issue, and  suggested including a reference to consideration by SBI as well as  SBSTA. The G-77/CHINA also called for more expedited consideration  of this issue by the COP and, supported by AUSTRALIA, CANADA and  others, proposed including reference to incentives. The EU, US,  ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP and others preferred the text as  presented, with the US emphasizing the discussion under SBSTA. The  EU said submissions could also be sought from observer  organizations. Informal consultations will continue.

### DETERMINATION OF A QUANTIFIED EMISSION REDUCTION COMMITMENT FOR  BELARUS

Informal consultations were convened by Andrej Kranjc  (Slovenia). At least one negotiating group raised concerns that an  amendment to the Protocol would be needed for Belarus to become an  Annex B Party. Further consultations are expected.

### EMISSIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL AVIATION AND MARITIME TRANSPORT

Bilateral and small-group consultations with interested Parties  were convened by José Romero (Switzerland). Discussions focused on  a workshop on this issue. Consultations in a larger group setting  are expected on Tuesday.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Informal consultations on the Adaptation Fund  continued through the day, while the contact group reconvened in  the evening to take up other outstanding items. Consultations on  the Adaptation Fund resumed later in the evening.

###     Adaptation Fund

Delegates engaged in line-by-line discussion of  the Co-Chairs' draft text. The Co-Chairs introduced a revised  draft decision late in the evening that includes clean text in the  preamble, but which has considerable bracketed text in the  operational section.

###     GEF Report to the COP

Delegates agreed to revised draft SBI  conclusions that are consistent with the contact group's previous  decision that the conclusions should be short and focus on taking  note of the report.

###     Special Climate Change Fund

SBI Chair Becker began informal  consultations to resolve bracketed text. Key outstanding areas  include language on the priority areas for the SCCF and the timing  regarding the COP's review of the status of SCCF implementation in  such areas.

###     Implementation of Decision 5/CP.8

Delegates agreed to the draft  SBI conclusions that were considered at the previous meeting of  the contact group.

###     Additional Guidance to the GEF

Delegates agreed to a draft COP  decision that focuses on requesting the GEF to provide additional  information on the impact of the RAF on the climate change focal  area. The draft decision also includes language agreed to at a  SBSTA contact group on potential support for carbon capture and  storage technologies by the GEF.

###     Application of the MOU between the COP and the GEF Council

The  Co-Chairs introduced a draft decision, noting that while the  decision would apply, mutatis mutandis, the MOU with respect to  guidance to the entity entrusted with the operation of the  financial mechanism of the Convention, it would not apply to the  Adaptation Fund, as no decision has been taken on the operational  entity for that fund. Delegates will consult informally before  reconsidering this item at the next contact group meeting.

### JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (JI)

During informal consultations, Parties  considered parts of a Chair's draft COP/MOP decision. Developing  countries proposed deleting reference to small scale JI projects,  explaining that CDM small scale guidelines were adopted due to  concerns specific to developing countries and the CDM process. An  Annex I Party opposed the deletion, noting that many JI projects  are small, and emphasizing the need to encourage mitigation  measures. Highlighting the need to assist vulnerable countries,  developing countries suggested levying 2% of JI Emissions  Reduction Units (ERUs) for the Adaptation Fund. A developed  country stressed the different objectives of JI and CDM under the  Protocol and said that, unlike CDM, there is no need for JI  projects to contribute to sustainable development in developing  countries. No agreement was reached. Chair Daniela Stoycheva  (Bulgaria) was to consult with interested Parties later in the  evening, focusing on the use of the CDM's designated operational  entities (DOEs), CDM methodologies and CDM project design document  for second-track JI projects.

### MITIGATION

The group met informally in the afternoon and late  into the night. Discussions were continuing as of 11:45 pm.

### REPORT OF THE CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

Co-Chairs David Brackett  (Canada) and André do Lago (Brazil) explained that five separate  consultations had been held earlier on Monday with interested  Parties on: administrative issues; additionality; carbon dioxide  capture and storage under the CDM; share of proceeds to cover  administrative expenses of the Executive Board; and whether local,  national or regional policy standards and programmes can be  considered CDM project activities. The Co-Chairs distributed a new  draft decision. They characterized the informal consultations as  constructive, although agreement had not been reached on the five  topics listed above and on some other issues, including  retroactive crediting and the CDM's continuity beyond 2012.  Outlining the brackets, Co-Chair Brackett identified the question  of policy standards and programmes under the CDM as one of the key  areas requiring further consultations. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  proposed new text increasing the share of proceeds to cover the  Board's administrative expenses to US$0.50 per CER. BRAZIL  responded that it was considering proposing to levy a share of  proceeds from JI projects and emissions trading to the Adaptation  Fund. The Co-Chairs asked Parties to reconsider these proposals  and said informal consultations with interested Parties would  continue on Tuesday afternoon.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Co-Chair Holger Liptow (Germany) reported to  the contact group that a draft decision had been approved during  informal consultations late Saturday, pending an agreement on  draft conclusions. The draft decision, inter alia: invites Parties  to submit their view on the status and continuation of the Expert  Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT); requests the Secretariat to  organize a senior-level roundtable discussion on technology  cooperation and partnerships, deployment and transfer; and  requests SBSTA to take into account existing technology-based  international cooperation when considering future work for  enhancing the implementation of the framework. Delegates agreed to  the outstanding paragraph relating to the 2006 EGTT Work  Programme, which dealt with a side event on public technologies.  They also agreed to conclusions on a technical paper by the  Secretariat on adaptation technologies discussed in a recent  workshop in Trinidad and Tobago.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates were expressing growing concerns about divisions in  negotiations on Monday night. Although several less controversial  issues were resolved, arguments over financial matters and the  mechanisms intensified, with at least one 'shouting match'  breaking out between delegates. According to talk in the  corridors, a major point of contention is over how to make the  mechanisms more attractive. Moves by developing countries to  impose a levy on joint implementation projects to fund the  Adaptation Fund were not well received by JI hosts and investors  that stand to gain from JI. The proposal prompted what one  participant called 'a tit-for-tat response' from the Russian  Federation aimed at increasing the levy on CDM - the mechanism  focused on developing countries.

'It's like a competition between JI and CDM, with each side trying  to make their mechanism more attractive to investors,' alleged one  expert. 'This is the time to be taking issues off the negotiating  table, not adding them,' said another.

Others were more sanguine: 'This will go down to the wire on  Friday, and it's too early to expect Parties to give up any  negotiating chips just yet,' explained a veteran.

Meanwhile, informal consultations on Article 3.9 (future  commitments) were still continuing late into Monday night.  Delegates outside the room seemed confused as to what exactly was  going on, and about how President Dion's latest initiative on  future scenarios under the UNFCCC related to Article 3.9 talks.
