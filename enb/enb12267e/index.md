# SBSTA

On Tuesday morning, a SBSTA round table was held on Annex I  Parties' policies and measures (P&Ms). The event, which was  mandated by SBSTA 20, involved presentations and discussions aimed  at sharing information and exchanging experiences in implementing  P&Ms. The meeting was divided into three parts: domestic aspects;  international aspects; and cross-cutting issues. Jonathan  Pershing, World Resources Institute, facilitated the meeting.

### DOMESTIC ASPECTS OF ANNEX I POLICIES AND MEASURES

Artur  Runge-Metzger, European Commission, stressed the EU climate  programme's focus on cost-effective measures to meet the Kyoto  targets, and cooperation with stakeholders. Toshiyuki Sakamoto,  Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, drew attention  to the Top-Runner Programme, which sets high energy efficiency  standards.

Franz-Josef Schafhausen, German Federal Ministry for the  Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, reported on  his country's climate protection policies. Gregory Picker,  Australian Greenhouse Office, reflected on Australia's experiences  in developing approaches to energy efficiency and synthetic  greenhouse gases. He highlighted the 'suite of approaches' taken  and industry involvement.

Chris Leigh, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs,  UK, spoke about his country's experiences with P&Ms, focusing on  the greenhouse gas levy and the UK's emissions trading scheme.

In the ensuing discussion, BRAZIL stressed the need to focus on  results and monitoring and evaluation plans. CHINA expressed an  interest in Japan's programme, tax incentive policies, and  Germany's job creation.

### INTERNATIONAL ASPECTS OF ANNEX I POLICIES AND MEASURES

Presentations: David Fuss, Natural Resources Canada, presented on  Canada's P&Ms, emphasizing flexibility and fungibility of trading  schemes. Artur Runge-Metzger, European Commission, presented on  the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, highlighting its openness.

Toshiyuki Sakamoto, Japan, reported on demonstration projections  for enhancing energy efficiency in Asia, promotion of energy- related CDM projects, and new climate-friendly technologies.  Daniela Stoycheva, Ministry of Environment and Water, Bulgaria,  spoke about her country's climate change strategy and the design  of a green investment scheme.

### CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES

Participants discussed Annex I Parties'  efforts to implement P&Ms in such a way as to minimize the adverse  effects on non-Annex I Parties. NIGERIA noted a lack of progress  on this issue. SAUDI ARABIA called for financial compensation and  tariff concessions.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2006-2007

At this SBI contact  group, delegates discussed Chair Ashe's revised draft SB 22  conclusions and COP 11/MOP 1 decisions. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  said he could not support a budget increase of 22 percent. The EU,  opposed by the US, reiterated that the budget should be fixed in  Euros. Nigeria, for the G-77/CHINA, said the documents must  reference funding for four annual meetings of each expert group,  as mandated by the COP. Chair Ashe will consult informally with  delegations.

### INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE SECRETARIAT'S ACTIVITIES

Chair Dovland  convened this contact group on the internal review of the  activities of the Secretariat (FCCC/2005/6) to review his revised  draft. On the draft recommendations of the SBI to COP 11, a  paragraph proposed earlier by the EU on cooperation and  communication with other relevant international organizations, was  opposed by the US. The paragraph was deleted. India, for the  G-77/CHINA, introduced a reference to the biennium budget document  (FCCC/SBI/2005/8).

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This contact group  considered the Chair's revised draft conclusions, including a  number of items in brackets. Saudi Arabia, for the G-77/CHINA,  objected to a reference to building on SBI guidance in a request  to the Bureau of COP 10 to participate in finalizing details of  the high-level segments at COP 11 and COP/MOP 1. The reference was  deleted. Regarding future sessional periods, SAUDI ARABIA objected  to an IPCC request that COP 13 be postponed for three to four  weeks to allow time for preparation of a synthesis report of the  Fourth Assessment Report. The EU, with AOSIS, NORWAY, the AFRICA  GROUP and JAPAN, supported the IPCC request.

On the organization of intergovernmental meetings and the  recommendations of a workshop held during SB 21, the G-77/CHINA  opposed specific references to giving further consideration to the  clustering of agenda items and longer-term cycles for agenda  items. The references were deleted. Reference to the workshop  report (FCCC/SBI/2005/2) was inserted in an introductory  paragraph.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Informal consultations on national  communications from non-Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.27) were  convened in the morning and evening to discuss a draft decision.  The EU, US, CANADA, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA proposed text stating that  non-Annex I Parties would make all efforts to submit their second  and, where appropriate, third national communications, within four  years of the initial financing, on an agreed full cost basis 'for  the three year project preparation period.' They also proposed  that, if necessary, non-Annex I Parties could have a one-year  extension for submission. The G-77/CHINA, questioned by some GEF  donor countries, argued that there was no basis for stipulating  the three-year period for the preparation of second or third  communications. The US noted that donor countries do not wish to  increase their funding of this activity.

A proposal that any extension of the submission period should not  imply additional financial resources from the GEF was qualified by  the G-77/CHINA, which sought to stipulate a submission period of  four years. However, there was no agreement on this. Consultations  may reconvene on Wednesday morning after talks with the SBI Chair.

### RESEARCH NEEDS RELATING TO THE CONVENTION

During informal  consultations on this issue, delegates agreed to a draft decision  based on conclusions from SBSTA 17 and 20. Co-Chairs Cigarán and  Castellari will hold discussions on draft conclusions in the  contact group on Wednesday.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates met informally in the morning,  afternoon and evening to consider Co-Chairs' draft Terms of  Reference for EGTT and draft conclusions. Negotiations were  stalled in the morning on whether EGTT should 'be requested' or  'consider' the proposed tasks. Delegates considered EGTT tasks  paragraph-by-paragraph in the afternoon, without reaching  agreement. Contentious issues included the evaluation of COP  decisions since COP 1, the assessment of implementation of the  framework, and who should take action for the involvement of the  private sector.

### SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES

Informal consultations facilitated  by SBSTA Vice-Chair Amjah Abdulla were held Tuesday afternoon.  Delegates considered a revised Chair's text, but were unable to  agree language requesting submissions by 19 August 2005 on how the  COP could further implement the Mauritius Strategy. CANADA  expressed concerns that there was no end point to the process.  TUVALU suggested setting COP 11 as a concluding date.

Two additional paragraphs proposed by the EU also caused some  disagreement. The US, CANADA, INDIA and others objected to  EU-proposed text linking climate change and sea-level rise to the  Millennium Review in September 2005. Delegates also discussed text  proposed by the EU that would link the prioritization of energy  efficiency and renewable energy with the Commission on Sustainable  Development's fourteenth and fifteenth sessions in 2006-2007. A  further meeting is expected Wednesday.

### ADAPTATION

Delegates met in a contact group to discuss  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change. Co-Chair Shevlin  presented a draft annex on elements for the SBSTA programme of  work on adaptation, with Parties providing general comments.

Samoa, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, called for specific,  action-oriented language. The US suggested identifying a single  objective. SOUTH AFRICA, with the COOK ISLANDS, called for  reference to the most vulnerable Parties. The EU, with CANADA and  the US, proposed using language from Decision 1/CP.10. SENEGAL,  supported by MICRONESIA, called for reference to capacity  building. SOUTH AFRICA highlighted the need for parallel rather  than sequential approaches.

### MITIGATION

In a contact group meeting co-chaired by Kok Seng Yap  and Tashiyuki Sakamoto, delegates focused on reporting on 'lessons  learned from the mitigation workshopsand any future steps under  this agenda item,' and on how to report the outcomes. The EU  proposed holding a pre-session workshop. China, for the  G-77/CHINA, proposed requesting the Secretariat to prepare a  concise report of what has been done to date. The US said it was  'skeptical' about workshops, and questioned the value of spending  one week of negotiations to agree on terms of reference for a  three hour workshop. The G-77/CHINA asked if the workshop was  intended to exchange views on lessons learned from previous  workshops or on next steps under this agenda item. The Co-Chairs  will prepare draft conclusions and consult informally.

### CDM AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES

Chair Georg Børsting  presented draft conclusions. CHINA and the US preferred limiting  invitations for submissions to Parties, while the EU favored also  inviting submissions from admitted observers and relevant  intergovernmental organizations. The EU requested additional time  for consultations. Chair Børsting said that if no comments are  received by midday Wednesday, he will consider the text agreed.

### MATTERS RELATING TO THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

Delegates at  the contact group agreed on the importance of ensuring equitable  access to the LDC Fund. Much of the debate centered on the role of  full-cost funding and funding for priority actions. The EU noted  the need for funding to address the adverse effects of climate  change rather than climate variability. UGANDA, for the LDC Group,  noted the difficulty in making such a differentiation. JAPAN  stressed the need to ensure that funding is used for the highest  priority items from the NAPAs. Several LDCs noted that the NAPA  process itself identifies such priorities. Discussions ended at  10:00 pm without a final resolution.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Memories of COP 9 and COP 10 plenary exchanges on the LDC Fund  returned to the corridors Tuesday as delegates began to suspect  that they were about to relive the inconclusive negotiations, in  the style of the 'Groundhog Day' Hollywood film about someone  fated to repeat the same day again and again. Since COP 8's  decision that further guidance for the operation of the LDC Fund  would have to be developed for the GEF, negotiators from both  sides seem to feel they have been starting over at each day of  each session. Some attributed the sense of déjà vu to a rushed  decision at COP 9, and handing over the initiative to the GEF  Council at the expense of LDC delegates.

Likewise, there were signs the budget negotiations could also take  a repetitive turn.
