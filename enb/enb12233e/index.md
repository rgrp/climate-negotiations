abstract: "The twentieth sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB-20) of the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  open today at the Maritim Hotel in Bonn, Germany. The Subsidiary  Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and  Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) have numerous issues on  the agenda in preparation for the entry into force of the Kyoto  Protocol. SBSTA will address, inter alia, methodological issues,  including good practice guidance for land use, land-use change and  forestry (LULUCF), harvested wood products and other issues  relating to LULUCF, and small-scale afforestation and  reforestation project activities under the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM). Parties will also address issues relating to  greenhouse gas inventories, Protocol Articles 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information), including registry  systems, and technology transfer. SBI will discuss, inter alia,  national communications, the financial mechanism, capacity  building, and administrative and financial matters."

Two in-session workshops will be held in conjunction with SB-20.  The first workshop, scheduled for Friday, 18 June, will address  impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change.  Participants will discuss risk assessment, perception of climate  change risk, adaptation and sustainable development, and case  studies of adaptation. The second in-session workshop, on climate  change mitigation, will be held on Saturday, 19 June. Participants  will address alternative development paths and the relationship of  climate change mitigation to other policy objectives, case studies  of mitigation, and climate mitigation and new technologies.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and a majority of  scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is  necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 189 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate to negotiate an agreement on strengthening efforts to  combat climate change. Following intense negotiations culminating  at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates agreed to a  Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed countries and  countries with economies in transition (EITs) to achieve  quantified emission reduction targets. These countries, known  under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their  overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least 5% below  1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period),  with specific targets varying from country to country. The  Protocol also establishes three mechanisms to assist Annex I  Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively: an  emissions trading system; joint implementation (JI) of  emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and a CDM  that allows for projects to be implemented in non-Annex I  (developing country) Parties.

At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how countries will cut emissions  and measure and assess emissions reductions. To enter into force,  the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, and by  Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of their total carbon  dioxide emissions for 1990. To date, 122 Parties have ratified the  Protocol, including 32 Annex I Parties, representing 44.2% of  the emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

In November 1998, Parties met at  COP-4 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and agreed to a set of decisions  known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The BAPA set  COP-6 as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational  details of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the  UNFCCC. Issues to be addressed included rules relating to the  mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting  methods for national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules  on crediting countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC  requiring resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 was held in The Hague, the Netherlands, from  13-25 November 2000. During the second week of negotiations, COP-6  President Jan Pronk (the Netherlands) attempted to facilitate  negotiations on the many disputed political and technical issues  by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions. After almost 36  hours of intense talks in the final two days, negotiators could  not agree on a range of topics, particularly financial issues,  supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance and  LULUCF. On Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk  announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement. Delegates  then agreed to suspend COP-6 and resume negotiations in 2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  agreement reached in Kyoto, stating that it considered the  Protocol to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy  and exempt key developing countries from emissions reduction  targets. Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II from 16-27 July 2001,  in Bonn. After protracted consultations, President Pronk presented  his proposal for a draft political decision. Despite support from  several Parties, disagreements surfaced over the nature of the  compliance regime. After several days of consultations, ministers  agreed to adopt President Pronk's political decision, with a  revised section on compliance. The political decision - or 'Bonn  Agreements' - needed to be operationalized through COP decisions.  These decisions were considered a 'package,' and since no  agreement was reached on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF,  all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates continued discussions on the 'Bonn Agreements' at  COP-7 and SB-15 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10  November 2001. After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on  LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues),  7 and 8, and input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development  (WSSD) was proposed. Although the deal was accepted by most  regional groups, some Annex I Parties, including Australia,  Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and the Russian Federation, did not  join the consensus, disputing, among other things, eligibility  requirements and credit banking under the mechanisms. However,  following extensive negotiations, the 'Marrakesh Accords' were  agreed.

### COP-8

Delegates to COP-8 and SB-17 met from 23 October to 1  November 2002, in New Delhi, India. On the final day of COP-8,  they adopted the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and  Sustainable Development. The Declaration reaffirms development and  poverty eradication as overriding priorities in developing  countries, and recognizes Parties' common but differentiated  responsibilities and national development priorities and  circumstances in the implementation of UNFCCC commitments. Parties  at COP-8 considered institutional and procedural issues under the  Protocol and adopted several decisions, including on the rules and  procedures for the Executive Board (EB) of the CDM.

### SB-18

Delegates to SB-18 met in Bonn from 4-13 June 2003. Parties  continued to address issues under negotiation since COP-8 and  prepare for the Protocol's entry into force. Conclusions were  agreed on a number of agenda items, including on Protocol Articles  5, 7 and 8. The issue of the Secretariat's programme budget for  2004-5 and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) proved to be  particularly difficult, and discussions were left unfinished  until COP-9.

### COP-9

From 1-12 December 2003, Parties met at COP-9 and SB-19, in  Milan, Italy, to adopt 22 decisions and several conclusions. The  last outstanding detail of the BAPA was finalized when Parties  agreed on modalities and procedures for afforestation and  reforestation activities for the first commitment period under the  CDM. Concluding discussions on the Secretariat's programme budget  for 2004-5 from SB-18, Parties agreed to a 9% budget increase.  Negotiations on the operation of the SCCF and the Least Developed  Countries' (LDC) Fund proved to be challenging, with protracted  discussions on the LDC Fund postponing the closing of the COP.  Negotiations on good practice guidance for LULUCF were also  lengthy, and will be continued at SB-20.
