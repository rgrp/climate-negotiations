# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL MEETINGS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates considered draft  SBSTA conclusions. On demonstrable progress, SAUDI ARABIA,  opposed by the EU, proposed deleting the paragraph  recognizing the first national communication submitted  under Article 7.2, stressing that the approach was too  narrow. SWITZERLAND suggested compromise language that was  accepted by the group. Delegates then considered Part II of  the guidelines under Article 8. Under Identification and  Classification of Problems by Expert Review Teams (ERTs),  the US, opposed by the EU, proposed moving the section on  classification, stressing that ERT's should identify rather  than classify problems. On Timing, the US suggested setting  strict deadlines for submission of reports, while leaving  broader issues flexible. On Reporting, the US proposed  integrating the paragraphs on status reports, individual  inventory review reports and adjustment reports into  earlier sections.

Parties considered New Zealand's proposal on Part III of  the guidelines under Article 8. The G-77/CHINA proposed  bracketing the entire text. On the scope of the review,  GERMANY suggested that it cover cancellation of assigned  amount units, including cancellation with respect to  LULUCF. With SWITZERLAND, she asked why the section on  reporting had been deleted. Parties also briefly considered  text on the annual compilation and accounting of emissions  inventories and assigned amounts.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Parties continued deliberations on  Vulnerability and Adaptation in the revised Co-Chairs'  draft text on FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9. Delegates stressed  that lack of agreement on the chapeau would have  implications for discussions on other paragraphs. CHINA  underscored integrating adaptation into sustainable  development programmes, as this is the ultimate objective  of the FCCC, but stressed the right of a sovereign state to  design its own national policies. The US cautioned against  the implications of this for GEF funding according to the  three-stage process set out by decision 11/CP.1. The EU,  supported by the US and CANADA, endorsed text on pilot  and/or demonstration projects, which supported the concept  of learning by doing. The G-77/CHINA preferred text on  immediate implementation of adaptation activities where  sufficient information is available.

On establishing a fund for climate-related disaster relief,  the EU cautioned against duplicating other organizations'  work. With the US, he highlighted that such a fund could  add complexity to the provision of funding due to the  difficulty in distinguishing between natural and human- induced climate disasters.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates revisited amendments  proposed Tuesday by different Parties on Purposes and  Overall Approach in the draft framework for meaningful and  effective actions to enhance implementation of FCCC Article  4.5. On Purposes, diverging views were expressed over  whether the framework 'shall serve as the framework for' or  'enhance' Article 4.5 implementation.

Several Parties objected to reference to 'state of the art'  technologies, stating that those are not always  economically viable. JAPAN proposed referring to  technologies that are 'suitable to local needs,' while the  EU suggested 'technologies that are appropriate to the  situation in the respective country.' The REPUBLIC OF KOREA underscored the role of governments  in providing a regulatory framework for a market for ESTs.  The G-77/CHINA stressed putting into context the role of  governments and the private sector in removing barriers and  restrictions to technology transfer.

The US opposed the G-77/CHINA proposal to delete reference  to 'integrated approaches' to technology transfer. Noting  continuing disagreement over large parts of the text, Co- Chair Cooper proposed preparing draft conclusions noting  the decision to continue deliberations during the second  half of SBSTA-13.

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Delegates completed  discussions on the elements for a draft decision on best  practices in P&Ms. CANADA, the US, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA,  opposed by the EU, urged bracketing all references to the  'consultative process.' The US and JAPAN bracketed the list  of activities aimed at improving the transparency,  effectiveness and comparability of P&Ms. JAPAN and the US,  opposed by the EU and G-77/CHINA, advocated deleting the  link between P&Ms and demonstrable progress. JAPAN  questioned reference to measuring demonstrable progress by  means of criteria and quantitative parameters. The G-77/CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by CANADA and AUSTRALIA,  proposed text on the need to minimize the adverse effects  of Annex I Parties.

On the contribution of international organizations to the  process, the G-77/CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA urged specific  reference to OPEC. HUNGARY and the EU proposed reference to  relevant international and intergovernmental organizations.  The US bracketed a request to the Secretariat to organize a  workshop and report its results to COP-7. The draft  conclusions were amended, with reference to Article 2.1 and  the consultative process being deleted.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Economies in transition (EITs):  Delegates considered the framework for capacity building in  EITs and a proposed draft decision on capacity building in  EITs. SLOVENIA introduced the draft decision that, inter  alia, decides to establish a process and create a framework  for capacity-building activities in EITs, urges Annex II  Parties to ensure financial support required for the  implementation of the capacity building process and further  urges the GEF to develop an operational strategy to  implement the elements of a framework process for capacity  building. Following comments and questions on the decision,  Co-Chair Uosukainen requested Slovenia to consult  informally to seek agreement on the text.

Among the issues raised in discussing the draft framework  were the need to elaborate one formulation regarding  implementation of the FCCC and Protocol and to clarify how  information will be provided to enable the COP to review  progress in implementing the framework.

Developing countries: On text outlining a framework  relating to capacity building in developing countries,  UGANDA, speaking for the LDCs, said the group's position  had not been reflected in the text. Participants agreed to  continue informal consultations in a smaller group.

### LULUCF

Delegates provided their views on the Co-Chairs'  text on elements related to Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4,  focusing on definitions for, inter alia: forest;  afforestation, reforestation and their distinctions;  deforestation; size of the assessment unit; and forest  management. SWITZERLAND submitted a written proposal on  behalf of the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP.

Following discussions, Co-Chair Thorgeirsson noted support  by several Parties for the FAO forest definition with  Party-specific thresholds, and by some for definitions at  the international level, as determined by the COP. He  recognized that Parties did not find a separate definition  of 'historic' with regards to afforestation and  reforestation useful. He said some Parties suggested  removing paragraphs distinguishing harvesting from  deforestation, and that the group would be considering the  issue of degradation further. He noted useful guidance  received on the size of the assessment unit, and welcomed  discussion of forest management. BOLIVIA, on behalf of  several Latin American countries, introduced a textual  proposal that also relates to Article 12 (CDM). Delegates  then addressed issues relating to eligibility of  activities.

### MECHANISMS

Delegates considered the text on modalities and  procedures for a CDM. JAPAN, HONDURAS and several Latin  American Parties, opposed by TUVALU, proposed deleting the  list of requirements for project activities. The AFRICA  GROUP urged equitable geographic distribution of CDM  projects. The US highlighted elements in its written  submission relating to, inter alia: an 'eligibility  threshold' that addressed difficulties with investment  additionality; standards for baselines; and crediting for  sinks. The EU emphasized its proposals on baselines and  public participation in the CDM. The G-77/CHINA highlighted  additionality, stressing that this is wider than baselines.  The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said baselines are the only practical  criteria for screening business-as-usual projects. CANADA  highlighted difficulties in implementing various forms of  additionality other than environmental additionality.

On the linkage between CDM and LULUCF, BRAZIL, with the G-77/CHINA, argued that CDM discussions be contingent on  decisions in the LULUCF contact group, and objected to a  proposed presentation by the Secretariat on this issue, and  to a question-and-answer session by the Chair. AUSTRALIA,  the US, JAPAN, SWITZERLAND, and NEW ZEALAND expressed  concern with this objection. In closing discussions on the  CDM, Chair Chow expressed concern with the number of key  issues on which Parties had not given guidance.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Informal consultations were held  regarding a G-77/China proposal on providing additional  guidance to the GEF. The US, with CANADA and the EU, said  the proposal addressed issues currently under consideration  in other negotiating groups, such as discussions on Stage  III adaptation, and cautioned against moving beyond other  related negotiations. CANADA suggested initially  considering parts of the text relating to operational  aspects of the financial mechanism. The G-77/CHINA said  ongoing discussions in other groups should not prevent  guidance being given to the financial mechanism.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Delegates continued deliberations on the Co-Chairs' text.  On the submission of questions of implementation, BRAZIL,  with SAUDI ARABIA and EGYPT, bracketed text permitting the  compliance committee to receive questions indicated in  Protocol Article 8 ERT reports. AUSTRALIA, opposed by  SAMOA, bracketed text permitting one Party to raise  questions with respect to another. The G-77/CHINA, opposed  by NEW ZEALAND, supported a role for the COP/MOP in  submitting questions Regarding allocation of questions, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by  SAMOA, suggested that guidelines be formulated to aid  allocation. The G-77/CHINA proposed that a plenary of the  compliance committee perform the allocation function.

On the preliminary examination of questions, the US  suggested that with respect to eligibility requirements  under the mechanisms the determination be made according to  the non-compliance criteria in Articles 5, 7 and 8. SAMOA  asked that the formulation not be limited to Articles 5, 7  and 8, but leave room for other criteria developed in the  mechanisms group, such as on supplementarity. On sources of  information, the US, supported by NEW ZEALAND and SAMOA,  suggested text permitting outsider participation. On the  expedited procedure for the mechanisms, NEW ZEALAND,  opposed by SAMOA, suggested that its link to the appeal  makes it credible. On appeal, the EU, SAMOA and the  FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA doubted the necessity of an  appeal, as it would delay the process and merely afford  Parties the opportunity to have their case heard twice.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some observers have detected a growing feeling of  frustration and unease as time for negotiation in Lyon  starts to run out. Wednesday's stand-off in the mechanisms  group on whether to include LULUCF in the CDM, loss of  momentum on the technology transfer text, and an outcome in  the P&Ms meeting that some found disappointing, all  contributed to a sense of concern at the apparent lack of  progress.
