Around 5,000 participants are expected to meet at COP-10. With the  Russian Federation's ratification of the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol  on 18 November 2004, Parties are now able to look forward to the  entry into force of that instrument, which will take place on 16  February 2005. COP-10 is thus the final gathering of the Parties  before the Protocol becomes legally binding.

At COP-10, delegates will take up the financial mechanism of the  UNFCCC, including the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and  guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF). Further  discussion on the good practice guidance for land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF) is also expected. Other issues that  will be addressed by SBSTA include: small-scale afforestation and  reforestation project activities under the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM); technology transfer; greenhouse gas inventories  and projections, and issues relating to reporting and reviewing  inventories; and 'good practices' in policies and measures. SBI  will address, among other things: capacity building; national  communications from Annex I and non-Annex I Parties; UNFCCC  Article 6 (education, training and public awareness);  administrative and financial matters; and the implementation of  UNFCCC Article 4.8 (adverse effects) and 4.9 (Least Developed  Countries).

Three in-session workshops are scheduled to take place during  COP-10. The first workshop, planned for Wednesday, 8 December, will  address adaptation. The second workshop, on climate change  mitigation, will be held on Thursday, 9 December. A final workshop  will be held on Saturday, 11 December, to discuss organization of  the intergovernmental process. SBI-21 and SBSTA-21 are expected to  conclude their work on Tuesday, 14 December.

During the COP's high-level segment, scheduled for 15-17 December,  ministers and heads of delegation will meet in four panel sessions  to discuss 'The Convention after 10 years: accomplishments and  future challenges,' 'Impacts of climate change, adaptation  measures and sustainable development,' 'Technology and climate  change,' and 'Mitigation of climate change: policies and their  impacts.'

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, natural resources and  physical infrastructure. Global climate varies naturally, but  scientists agree that rising concentrations of anthropogenically  produced greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere are leading to  changes in the climate. According to the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of climate change have  already been observed, and scientists believe that precautionary  and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 189 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In December 1997, delegates met at COP-3 in  Kyoto, Japan, and agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits  developed countries and countries making the transition to a  market economy to achieve quantified emission reduction targets.  These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed  to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at  least 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first  commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to  country. The Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms  to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets  cost-effectively: an emissions trading system; joint  implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between  Annex I Parties; and the CDM, which allows for projects to be  implemented in non-Annex I (developing country) Parties.

At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how countries will cut emissions,  and measure and assess emissions reductions. To date, 129 Parties  have ratified the Protocol, including 36 Annex I Parties,  representing 61.6% of 1990 Annex I emissions, meeting the  requirements for entry into force of the Protocol.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

In November 1998, Parties met at  COP-4 in Buenos Aires and agreed to a set of decisions known as  the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The BAPA set COP-6 as the  deadline for reaching agreement on the operational details of the  Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC. In  particular, issues to be addressed were rules relating to the  mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting  methods for national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules  on crediting countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC  that required resolution included questions of capacity building,  the development and transfer of technology, and assistance to  those developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PARTS I AND II

COP-6 Part I was held in The Hague, the  Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000. During discussions on the  BAPA, negotiators could not agree on a range of topics,  particularly on financial issues, the use of the mechanisms,  compliance and LULUCF. On Saturday afternoon, 25 November,  delegates agreed to suspend COP-6 and resume negotiations in 2001.  Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II from 16-27 July 2001, in Bonn,  Germany. After protracted consultations, ministers agreed to adopt  a political decision, with a revised section on compliance. This  political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - needed to be  operationalized through COP decisions. These decisions were  considered a 'package,' but as agreement had not been reached on  the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF, all draft decisions were  forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates continued discussions on the 'Bonn Agreements' at  COP-7 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10 November 2001.  After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on LULUCF, mechanisms,  compliance, Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), and  input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was  proposed. Following extensive negotiations, delegates agreed, and  the 'Marrakesh Accords' were adopted.

### COP-8

Delegates to COP-8 met from 23 October to 1 November 2002,  in New Delhi, India. On the final day of COP-8, they adopted the  Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainable Development.  The Declaration reaffirms development and poverty eradication as  overriding priorities in developing countries, and recognizes  Parties' common but differentiated responsibilities and national  development priorities and circumstances in the implementation of  UNFCCC commitments. Parties also considered institutional and  procedural issues under the Protocol and adopted several decisions,  including on the rules and procedures for the Executive Board (EB)  of the CDM.

### COP-9

From 1-12 December 2003, Parties met at COP-9 in Milan,  Italy. The last outstanding detail of the BAPA was finalized when  Parties agreed on modalities and procedures for afforestation and  reforestation activities under the CDM for the first commitment  period. Negotiations on the operation of the SCCF and the Least  Developed Countries' (LDC) Fund proved to be challenging, with  protracted discussions on the LDC Fund postponing the closing of  the COP. Negotiations on good practice guidance for LULUCF were  also lengthy, and remained unfinished.

### SB-20

The twentieth sessions of SBI and SBSTA met from 16-25 June  2004, in Bonn. Among other things, SBSTA-20 considered small-scale  afforestation and reforestation CDM project activities and good  practice guidance on LULUCF. SBI-20 addressed the UNFCCC's  financial mechanism and arrangements for intergovernmental  meetings. Discussions on these issues are expected to continue at  the 21st sessions of SBI and SBSTA in Buenos Aires. Two in-session  workshops were also held; one on adaptation, and the other on  mitigation.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

A number of UNFCCC workshops and other relevant events have taken  place since SB-20.

### WORKSHOP ON HARVESTED WOOD PRODUCTS

This workshop met from 30  August to 1 September 2004, in Lillehammer, Norway. The objective  of the workshop was to increase the understanding of issues  relating to harvested wood products (HWP). Participants discussed  various aspects related to definitions and scope of estimating,  reporting and accounting of HWP. A report of the workshop will be  presented to SBSTA-21.

### WORKSHOP ON EMISSIONS PROJECTIONS

The workshop on emissions  projections was held from 6-8 September 2004, in Bonn, and aimed  to support the preparation of Annex I fourth national  communications. The workshop covered methods, assumptions,  indicators, key parameters of models and sensitivity analysis, and  the dissemination of methodologies for estimating emissions  projections. A workshop report will be presented to SBSTA-21.

### WORKSHOP ON TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The workshop on innovative  options for financing the development and transfer of technologies  was held from 27-29 September 2004, in Montreal, Canada. The  workshop sought to create a better understanding of innovative  financing for technology transfer under the UNFCCC. It provided an  opportunity for participants to share experiences and information  on good practice for financing technology transfer, and to  catalyze innovative thinking on the issue, as well as to help  narrow any differences that might exist. The discussions and  outcomes of the workshop will be taken up by SBSTA-21.

### WORKSHOP ON THE PREPARATION OF ANNEX I FOURTH NATIONAL  COMMUNICATIONS

This workshop was held from 30 September to 1  October 2004, in Dublin, Ireland. The purpose of the workshop was  to facilitate the timely submission of the fourth national  communications by Annex I Parties, which are due by 1 January  2006, and to encourage the exchange of views among technical  experts on the comparability and transparency of the information  in the communications. A report of the workshop will be presented  to SBI-21.

### IPCC-22

The 22nd session of the IPCC was held from 9-11 November  2004, in New Delhi. The meeting provided an opportunity for  continued deliberations on the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report  (AR4) due to be published in 2007. Participants discussed, inter  alia, the timing, scope, length and content of the AR4 Synthesis  Report, approving a process for its development. Delegates agreed  to a 30-page Synthesis Report with a five-page Summary for  Policymakers to be approved by the IPCC in late October 2007. The  session also held discussions on IPCC outreach, noting the need to  ensure that special reports and the AR4 reach the broadest  possible audience.

### ADDITIONAL EVENTS

Since SB-20, there have been numerous meetings  of the UNFCCC's constituted bodies, including meetings immediately  preceding COP-10. The LDC Expert Group met from 24-25 September in  Banjul, the Gambia. A hands-on training workshop on national  greenhouse gas inventories for the Latin America and Caribbean  region was held from 25-29 October in Panama City, Panama. The CDM  EB met for its 15th and 16th sessions in Bonn in September and  October, respectively, and its 17th session was held from 2-3  December in Buenos Aires. On 18 November, the first CDM project  was registered. The project aims to reduce emissions of methane  from a landfill in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Other  groups that met in Buenos Aires immediately prior to COP-10  include the Expert Group on Technology Transfer, which convened  from 2-4 December, and the Consultative Group of Experts on  non-Annex I national communications, which met from 2-3 December.
