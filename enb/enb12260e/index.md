abstract: "The tenth Conference of the Parties (COP-10) to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the  twenty-first sessions of the COP's Subsidiary Body for Scientific  and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and Subsidiary Body for  Implementation (SBI) were held at La Rural Exhibition Center in  Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 6-18 December 2004. Over 6100  participants from 167 governments, two  observer States, 272  intergovernmental, non-governmental and other observer  organizations, and 240 media outlets were in attendance. During  the meeting, Parties addressed and adopted numerous decisions and  conclusions on various issues, including: technology transfer;  issues relating to land use, land-use change and forestry; the  UNFCCC's financial mechanism; Annex I national communications;  capacity building; adverse effects and adaptation; and UNFCCC  Article 6 (education, training and public awareness)."

On Saturday, 18 December, Parties agreed on a proposal to hold a  Seminar by Government Experts prior to SB-22, and adopted a Buenos  Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures. The  purpose of the Seminar is to promote an informal exchange of  information on actions relating to mitigation and adaptation to  assist Parties to continue to develop effective and appropriate  responses to climate change, and on policies and measures adopted  by governments that support implementation of Parties' existing  commitments under the UNFCCC and Protocol.

Negotiations relating to a number of issues, including: the Least  Developed Countries Fund; the Special Climate Change Fund;  submission of second, or where appropriate, third national  communications from non-Annex I Parties; policies and measures;  and Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and  measures) were not completed, and these issues were forwarded to  SB-22 for further consideration.

Four high-level panel discussions were held on Wednesday and  Thursday, 15-16 December on: 'The UNFCCC after 10 Years:  accomplishments and future challenges,' 'Impacts of climate  change, adaptation measures and sustainable development,'  'Technology and climate change,' and 'Mitigation of climate  change: policies and their impacts.'  Three in-session workshops  were also held, on adaptation, mitigation and the organization of  the intergovernmental process, respectively. Over 90 side events  were held on issues ranging from emissions trading and the Clean  Development Mechanism to reviews of accomplishments of the UNFCCC  process.

The year 2004 marks the tenth anniversary of the entry into force  of the UNFCCC and, as such, many have been looking back with a  sense of accomplishment at the progress achieved over the past  decade. In addition, much of the world celebrated when the Russian  Federation ratified the Kyoto Protocol, ensuring the continuity of  mitigation efforts into the next decade as the Protocol enters  into force in early 2005. To make sure that the 'house' is in  order for the Protocol's imminent entry into force, Parties  gathered at COP-10 to complete the unfinished business from the  Marrakesh Accords, and reassess the building blocks of the process  and discuss the framing of a new dialogue on the future of climate  change policy.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, natural resources,  physical infrastructure and the environment. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically produced greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and scientific findings  indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 189 Parties. The Parties to the UNFCCC typically convene once  a year in a Conference of the Parties (COP), and twice a year in  meetings of the UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In December 1997, delegates met at COP-3 in  Kyoto, Japan, and agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits  developed countries and countries making the transition to a  market economy (EITs) to achieve quantified emissions reduction  targets. These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I  Parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six  greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between  2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets  varying from country to country. The Protocol also establishes  three flexible mechanisms to assist Annex I Parties in meeting  their national targets cost-effectively: an emissions trading  system; joint implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction projects  between Annex I Parties; and the Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM), which allows for projects to be implemented in non-Annex I  Parties. Following COP-3, Parties initiated negotiations on most  of the rules and operational details determining how countries  will reduce emissions, and measure and assess emissions  reductions. To date, 132 Parties have ratified the Protocol,  including 37 Annex I Parties, representing 61.6% of 1990 Annex I  greenhouse gas emissions, meeting the requirements for entry into  force of the Protocol, which will take place on 16 February 2005.  During COP-10, Pakistan, Egypt, Nigeria, Oman, Indonesia,  Lichtenstein and Ukraine also announced their recent or imminent  ratifications.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

The Buenos Aires Plan of Action  (BAPA) was negotiated at COP-4 in 1998, in order to set out a  process for taking forward the provisions of the Protocol. The  BAPA set COP-6 as the deadline for reaching agreement on the  operational details of the Protocol and on strengthening  implementation of the UNFCCC. In particular, Protocol issues to be  addressed included rules relating to the flexible mechanisms, a  regime for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting methods for  national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules on  crediting countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC that  required resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

Following agreement on the BAPA at COP-4, subsequent meetings  attempted to reach agreement on the various elements of the work  programme. In November 2000, Parties met at COP-6 in The Hague,  the Netherlands, and attempted to complete these negotiations  without success. COP-6 was suspended until July 2001 when it  reconvened in Bonn, Germany. Delegates held protracted  consultations, and finally agreed to adopt a political decision,  the Bonn Agreements. However, this political decision needed to be  operationalized through COP decisions. These decisions were  considered a 'package,' but since agreement had not been reached  on the flexible mechanisms, compliance and land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF), all draft decisions were forwarded  to COP-7.

### THE MARRAKESH ACCORDS

Delegates continued discussions on the Bonn  Agreements at COP-7 in October/November 2001. Following extensive  negotiations, the Marrakesh Accords were adopted and have served  as the basis for subsequent negotiations. The Marrakesh Accords  set out building blocks for decisions under the Protocol and  UNFCCC, including: the flexible mechanisms and LULUCF; rules for  compliance; rules on communicating and reviewing information on  emissions and removals of greenhouse gases; and issues relating to  support for developing countries, including capacity building,  technology transfer, responding to the adverse effects of climate  change, and the establishment of three funds - the Least Developed  Countries (LDC) Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and  the Adaptation Fund.

### MOVE TOWARD IMPLEMENTATION

Delegates met at COP-8 in  October/November 2002, and again at COP-9 in December 2003 to  negotiate decisions for implementing the Marrakesh Accords. Among  other things, Parties agreed on rules and procedures for the CDM  Executive Board (EB), the body designated to supervise the CDM,  and modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation  (A&R) activities under the CDM, including small-scale activities  for the first commitment period. Parties also discussed how to  integrate findings of the IPCC's Third Assessment Report into the  work of the UNFCCC, agreeing on two new agenda items on adaptation  and on mitigation. Most recently, delegates met at the twentieth  sessions of SBI and SBSTA in June 2004, in Bonn. Among other  things, SBSTA-20 considered small-scale A&R CDM project activities  and good practice guidance (GPG) on LULUCF, and held two  in-session workshops on adaptation, and on mitigation. SBI-20  addressed the UNFCCC's financial mechanism and arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings.

# COP-10 REPORT

On Monday, 6 December 2004, COP-9 Vice President Mamadou Honadia  (Burkina Faso), on behalf of COP-9 President Miklós Persányi  (Hungary), introduced Ginés González García, Argentine Minister of  Health and the Environment, who was elected President of COP-10 by  acclamation. President González García emphasized that COP-10 is  the final session prior to the Kyoto Protocol's entry into force  and the first session of a new chapter devoted to taking action.  He stated that advanced research and knowledge must be accompanied  by increased resources, and that commitments from all members of  society are needed.

Anibal Ibarra, Mayor of Buenos Aires, welcomed participants to  Buenos Aires and highlighted the central role of local authorities  in responding to climate change and raising public awareness.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter highlighted the  tenth anniversary of the UNFCCC and presented a report of the  UNFCCC's first decade, underlining the challenges that lie beyond  2012. She suggested that Parties consider an equitable and  effective future strategy to ensure that all countries contribute  fairly to achieving the UNFCCC's objectives.

Numerous speakers welcomed the Russian Federation's ratification  of the Protocol and expressed hope that the US would also ratify  the Protocol. Qatar, on behalf of the G-77/China, noted the  impacts of recent climate-related disasters on developing  countries and emphasized Annex I Parties' responsibility for  financial resource mobilization for adaptation, stressing the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.

The Netherlands, on behalf of the EU, Bulgaria, Romania and  Turkey, expressed continued commitment to addressing climate  change and highlighted the launch of the EU emissions trading  scheme in January 2005. He supported limiting global temperature  rise to 2 degrees Celsius, noting that a greater increase would  result in irreversible damages. Tuvalu, on behalf of the Alliance  of Small Island States (AOSIS), highlighted the need for strong  linkages with the 10-year review of the implementation of the  Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of  Small Island Developing States (BPOA+10) and the World Conference  on Disaster Reduction (WCDR), both to be held in January 2005, and  emphasized the importance of dialogue on adaptation.

Noting that the first commitment period is only an initial step,  Switzerland, for the Environmental Integrity Group, urged Parties  to consider the format for discussions on addressing climate  change beyond 2012. Kenya, for the Africa Group, stressed the need  for progress on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 (adverse  effects). Tanzania, for the LDCs, expressed concern at the slow  disbursement of funds for the preparation of national adaptation  programmes of action (NAPAs). Saudi Arabia said that targets for  the second commitment period should be limited to Annex B Parties,  and should not include developing country Parties.

On Friday, 17 December, President González García said that the  following nominations had been received for COP Vice-President:  Jawad Ali Khan (Pakistan); Ahmed Majid Al-Naqbi (United Arab  Emirates); Nikolai Pomoshnikov (Russian Federation); Jacek Mizak  (Poland); Bruno Sekoli (Lesotho); Beat Nobs (Switzerland); and  Masao Nakayama (Micronesia).  Thomas Becker (Denmark) was elected  as SBI Chair, replacing Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria), who  completed her term at the end of SBI-21. Sylvia McGill (Jamaica)  served as COP Rapporteur.

During COP-10, Parties met in COP Plenary sessions on Monday, 6  December, Wednesday, 8 December, Friday, 17 December, and closed  on Saturday, 18 December. A high-level segment took place on  Wednesday and Thursday, 15-16 December, and included four panel  discussions. SBI and SBSTA opened on Monday, 6 December, and  continued meeting in formal sessions, contact groups and informal  sessions through Wednesday, 15 December. This report summarizes  the issues discussed at COP-10, organized in accordance with the  agendas of the SBSTA, SBI and COP.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya) opened SBSTA-21 on Monday,  6 December, noting that Arther Rolle (Bahamas) will continue to  serve as SBSTA Vice-Chair and Ibrahim Al-Ajmi (Oman) as  Rapporteur. Delegates adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/7).  SBSTA met on Monday, 6 December, Tuesday, 7 December and Friday,  10 December, and closed on Wednesday morning, 15 December.

### SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS OF IMPACTS OF, AND  VULNERABILITY AND ADAPTATION TO, CLIMATE CHANGE

This issue was  first addressed by SBSTA on Thursday, 9 December. Most countries  said the SBSTA in-session workshop held on Wednesday, 8 December,  had highlighted the urgency for action to address adaptation, and  that adaptation should be a global priority. The US said that  individual extreme weather events cannot be linked to climate  change. The EU recommended reviewing the outcomes of the SBSTA-20  and SBSTA-21 workshops to identify impacts of different levels and  rates of climate change, and adaptation options. Some countries  called for, inter alia, strengthening the adaptation  knowledge-base, promoting public participation, mobilizing funds  and technology transfer, and strengthening links with other  conventions.

A contact group co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and David  Warrilow (UK) met on Thursday, 9 December, to draft conclusions on  this issue since there was insufficient time for a decision at  COP-10. Many delegates called for transfer of adaptation  technology, and support for the development and use of indigenous  and local technologies, and said adaptation should be included in  sustainable development plans. On Monday, 13 December, delegates  considered draft conclusions prepared by the Co-Chairs and an  Argentine proposal to adopt a work programme on adaptation. The  proposal outlined elements for a work programme on adaptation that  seeks to, inter alia, address the domestic measures that Parties  should take to adapt to climate change and climate variability. It  proposes elements for a work programme such as work on data and  methodologies, vulnerability assessment, adaptation planning,  integration of adaptation into sustainable development, and  adaptation actions. The Africa Group supported the proposal and  suggested including the results of the SBSTA-21 in-session  workshops. Many Parties suggested including the proposal in  SBSTA's conclusions on adaptation. Australia, supported by the EU,  noted that the programme itself and its detailed activities could  be adopted at a later stage.

Following a series of closed informal consultations, the SBSTA  plenary was informed on Tuesday, 14 December, that details had not  yet been resolved on the proposed adaptation work programme and  how to relate this agenda item to the SBI item on implementation  of decision 5/CP.7. SBSTA amended the draft conclusions to account  for the lack of consensus on adaptation issues and forwarded them  to the COP President for further consideration. On Saturday, 18  December, COP Vice-President Nikolai Pomoshnikov said the results  of these discussions were incorporated into the decision on the  Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures  (FCCC/CP/2004/L.16), under the agenda item on the implementation  of decision 5/CP.7 (See page 10).

### SCIENTIFIC, TECHNICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC ASPECTS OF MITIGATION

This issue was first addressed by SBSTA on Friday, 10 December,  and subsequently in three contact group meetings co-chaired by Kok  Seng Yap (Malaysia) and Toshiyuki Sakamoto (Japan). SBSTA adopted  conclusions in plenary on Tuesday, 14 December.

Many Parties welcomed the in-session workshop held on Thursday, 9  December, on practical opportunities and solutions for mitigation  that contribute to sustainable development and technology  innovation, deployment and diffusion, and supported holding  additional in-session workshops at future SBSTA sessions.  Discussions in the contact group addressed, inter alia, possible  presentation topics for future in-session workshops. Opposed by  many Parties, the EU proposed consideration of 'elements of a  future work programme' at SBSTA-23.

On Tuesday, 14 December, Contact Group Co-Chair Sakamoto  introduced the draft conclusions, explaining that during informal  consultations, Parties agreed to remove brackets on text inviting  Parties to submit their views on lessons learned from the  mitigation workshops and any future steps under this agenda item.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.27),  SBSTA, inter alia, agrees to continue focusing its work on  exchanging information and sharing experiences and views among  Parties on practical opportunities and solutions to facilitate  implementation of the UNFCCC. SBSTA requests the Secretariat to  organize an in-session workshop at SBSTA-22, focusing on:factors that affect mitigation technology innovation,  deployment and diffusion, including international cooperative  efforts and removal of barriers; and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, such as costs and  benefits, co-benefits, poverty reduction, and economic impacts,  including spillover effects.

SBSTA invites Parties to submit their views on the organization of  the in-session workshop, on lessons learned from previous  mitigation workshops, and any future steps under this agenda item,  and requests the Secretariat to compile these submissions to  facilitate the ongoing consideration of these topics at SBSTA-23.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Good practice guidance for LULUCF  activities under the Protocol, harvested wood products (HWP) and  other issues relating to LULUCF: This issue was first addressed in  the SBSTA plenary on Monday, 6 December, and subsequently in a  contact group co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and William  Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana), which met five times from 6-13  December. Informal consultations were also held in an effort to  draft conclusions and negotiate a draft decision for adoption at  COP-10. On Tuesday, 14 December, SBSTA adopted conclusions on this  matter and on Friday, 17 December, the COP adopted the decision,  including a draft COP/MOP decision The contact group addressed the IPCC good practice guidance (GPG)  under the Protocol, the issue of harvested wood products, and  other matters relating to LULUCF. At SBSTA-20, delegates had not  been able to reach agreement on, inter alia, the methods for  accounting GPG, while the common reporting format tables had been  agreed on, except with regard to the identification of LULUCF  activities in relation to Protocol Article 6 (JI) and the coding  system to be used for identifying activities in relation to JI  projects.

In the first meeting of the contact group, Co-Chair Rosland,  supported by the EU, Canada and Japan, and opposed by the  G-77/China, proposed removing all brackets in the draft  negotiating text forwarded from SBSTA-20 and deleting the option  on the common reporting format referring to Protocol Article 6.  Following informal consultations, Parties agreed on a revised  draft decision text that stipulates that GPG will be applied in  a manner 'consistent' with the Marrakesh Accords, and includes a  footnote stating that reporting methods contained in the GPG  should ensure that land areas subject to LULUCF activities under  Articles 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and  3.4 (additional activities) can be identified.

On HWP, Parties could not agree on how the IPCC should develop  methods to estimate, measure and report on HWP in the 2006 IPCC  Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

On LULUCF matters, Australia, supported by Canada and Japan,  tabled a written proposal for an open-ended policy dialogue.  Australia, with the US, Canada and the EU, and opposed by the  G-77/China and AOSIS, supported addressing the issue of 'factoring  out' direct human-induced effects from the indirect and natural  effects of LULUCF activities. Parties did not reach consensus on  this matter, but agreed on a paragraph relating to the possible  application of biome-specific forest definitions.

On Tuesday 14 December, SBSTA adopted conclusions on GPG, HWP and  other LULUCF issues and forwarded a draft decision on GPG to the  COP, including a draft COP/MOP decision. The conclusions were  adopted by the COP on Friday, 17 December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions on LULUCF  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.26), SBSTA takes note of the information  contained in the document relating to LULUCF projects under  Protocol Article 6 (joint implementation). On HWP, SBSTA takes  note, inter alia, of the IPCC's work on developing methods to  estimate, measure, and report on HWP in the context of the 2006  IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, and the  intent of the IPCC to develop, for the purpose of compiling  greenhouse gas inventories under the UNFCCC, methods that are  neutral in relation to potential accounting approaches for HWP.  SBSTA also invites the IPCC to report, on a regular basis, on  progress made on this issue.

SBSTA also decides to continue the consideration of various  impacts of country-level data on production, use, and disposal of  HWP at SBSTA-23. SBSTA invites Parties that have not done so to  provide available data and information on changes in stocks and  emissions of greenhouse gases from HWP and to submit updated  information on HWP and experiences of the Revised 1996 IPCC  Guidelines and GPG to the Secretariat by 1 August 2005. SBSTA  requests the Secretariat to compile these submissions, and  information on HWP contained in previous submissions from Parties  specifically on HWP, and in national greenhouse gas inventory  reports, for consideration at SBSTA-23. SBSTA also agrees to  continue deliberation on items relating to factoring out at a  future session, noting that a decision on biome-specific  definitions is not needed at this stage.

###     COP Decision

In the decision on LULUCF  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.26/Add.1), the COP, inter alia, encourages  Annex I Parties that have ratified the Protocol to submit, on a  voluntary basis, estimates of greenhouse gas emissions by sources  and removals by sinks, using the common reporting format.

Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities  under the CDM: This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in plenary  on Monday, 6 December, and subsequently in a contact group  co-chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Jim Penman (UK), which met  four times between 7-13 December, Informal consultations were also  held in an effort to draft conclusions and negotiate a draft  decision for adoption at COP-10.

The contact group considered a bracketed annex to the draft  conclusions forwarded from SBSTA-20. At SBSTA-20, Parties were  unable to resolve issues of bundling (clustering small projects to  decrease transaction costs), leakage (unintended consequences of  activities leading to increasing emissions in an area outside the  project boundary), definitions of low-income communities and  monitoring.

In the opening SBSTA plenary, on Monday, 6 December, the  Secretariat presented a proposal for a draft decision on  small-scale A&R CDM, and on measures to facilitate their  implementation. Issues discussed focused on, inter alia: average  projected net anthropogenic greenhouse gas removals by sinks;  whether projects will be exempt from, or subject to, paying a lower  share of proceeds to the Protocol's Adaptation Fund; and reducing  rates of the share of project proceeds to cover administrative  expenses. Parties agreed to invite assistance for capacity-building  activities for the application and implementation of simplified  modalities and procedures. Parties informally resolved outstanding  issues of bundling, leakage, and monitoring. Delegates agreed to  forward these draft texts to the SBSTA plenary.

On Tuesday, 14 December, the SBSTA plenary adopted conclusions and  agreed to forward a draft decision to the COP, which it adopted on  Friday, 17 December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.20),  SBSTA notes that the Executive Secretary provided Parties with an  indication of administrative and budgetary implications of the  draft decision. SBSTA also notes that the decision can only be  implemented if supplementary funds are available.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.26/Add.1), the  COP decides, inter alia:to adopt simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale  A&R CDM project activities in the first commitment period; to limit small-scale A&R projects to net anthropogenic  greenhouse gas removals by sinks less than eight kilotonnes of  carbon dioxide per year if the average projected net anthropogenic  GHG removals by sinks for each verification period do not exceed  eight kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year; if a small-scale project results in excess removals of eight  kilotonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, excess removals  will not be eligible for the issuance of temporary or long-term  certified emissions reductions; and to exempt small-scale project activities from the share of  proceeds to be used to assist developing countries that are  particularly vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change and  shall be entitled to a reduced level of the non-reimbursable fee  for requesting registration and a reduced rate of the proceeds to  cover administrative expenses of the CDM.

The COP also requests, inter alia, that: the CDM EB develop, for  consideration by COP/MOP-1, default factors for assessing the  existing carbon stocks and for simplified baseline methodologies  for small-scale A&R projects, taking into account, if appropriate,  types of soil, lifetime of project and climatic conditions. The  COP invites Parties to provide support to project participants  interested in coordinating submission of several project  activities, with a view to reducing the costs of validation,  verification, and certification. The COP also invites relevant  multilateral agencies, intergovernmental organizations, and  nongovernmental organizations to participate in preparing these  activities.

Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime  transport: This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in plenary on  Monday, 6 December, and subsequently in informal consultations  facilitated by Eduardo Calvo (Peru). Consultations aimed to  address collaboration with the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organization  (IMO), methodological issues for the allocation of emissions from  international aviation and maritime transport, and the timeline  for addressing this issue. In plenary, on Tuesday, 14 December,  SBSTA adopted conclusions with a minor amendment.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.18),  SBSTA takes note of the continuing work of ICAO and IMO, and the  ongoing cooperation among the secretariats of the UNFCCC, ICAO,  IMO and IPCC on the issue of emissions from international aviation  and maritime transport. SBSTA also requests the UNFCCC Secretariat  to prepare information on methodological issues by SBSTA 22.

###     Issues relating to greenhouse gas inventories

This issue was  first addressed by SBSTA in plenary on Tuesday, 7 December, and  subsequently in informal consultations facilitated by Branca  Americano (Brazil) and Helen Plume (New Zealand). On Tuesday, 14  December, SBSTA adopted conclusions without amendment.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.17),  SBSTA notes the substantial and steady improvement in the  timeliness and quality of submissions of greenhouse gas  inventories, urges Parties to continue to improve their reporting,  and notes the benefits, in terms of capacity building, provided to  experts who participate in the greenhouse gas inventory review  process. SBSTA also notes the information provided by the IPCC on  the development of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National  Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

Issues relating to Protocol Articles 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information): This issue was first  considered by the SBSTA plenary on Tuesday, 7 December. Parties  met in a contact group facilitated by Murray Ward (New Zealand),  which also considered registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4.  On Tuesday, 14 December, SBSTA adopted conclusions and forwarded a  draft decision, including a draft COP/MOP decision, which was  adopted by the COP on Friday, 17 December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.30),  SBSTA considers a proposal for a standard electronic format for  reporting: supplementary information on emissions reduction units;  certified emissions reductions, including temporary and long-term  certified emissions reductions; assigned amount units; and removal  units.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.30/Add.1), the  COP, inter alia: requests the Secretariat to develop a compilation  and accounting database in coordination with the development of  the international transaction log (ITL) and to report progress to  SBSTA; and to consult with administrators of registry systems to  facilitate the review of national inventories and assigned amount  information under Protocol Article 8. The decision also includes a  draft decision on the same issue to be presented to COP/MOP-1 for  consideration.

###     Issues relating to registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4

This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in plenary on Tuesday, 7  December, and subsequently in the contact group chaired by Murray  Ward. Delegates discussed the issue in three contact group  meetings between 8-13 December, and in numerous informal meetings.  On Tuesday, 14 December, the SBSTA plenary adopted conclusions  recommending the adoption of the draft decision, which the COP  adopted on Friday, 17 December.

Discussions in the contact group centered on technical details  surrounding the role and tasks of the ITL administrator, with  China expressing concern about the performance of the ITL, and  proposing to request the ITL administrator to conduct testing and  independent assessments. The EU preferred the test plan and  schedules for the initialization of the electronic communications  with registry systems to be carried out prior to COP/MOP-1 in  order to ensure the prompt start of the CDM.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.29),  SBSTA takes note on work relating to registry systems and the  intersessional consultations on registry systems.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.29/Add.1), the  COP requests Parties to inform the Secretariat of the  organizations designated as administrators of national registries  or supplementary transaction logs by May 2005. The COP requests  the administrator of the ITL, inter alia, to:include standardized testing and independent assessment  reporting for registry systems and measures to ensure the  implementation of the data exchange standards, which include  automated checks to be performed by the ITL; make publicly available the information on the functions of  the ITL, including the automated checks; and facilitate the involvement of experts from non-Annex I  Parties who are Parties to the Protocol, in particular in relation  to the preparation of standardized testing and independent  assessment reporting for the ITL.

The COP also requests the SBSTA Chair to convene consultations  prior to SBSTA-22 with Protocol Parties and non-Annex I Parties on  the checks to be performed by the ITL and their conformity with  relevant provisions of decisions by the COP, and to report the  results of the consultations to SBSTA-22. In addition, the COP  requests the administrator of the ITL to report to SBSTA-22 on  progress regarding the implementation of the ITL, in particular in  relation to the content and timing of testing and initialization  of registry systems, with a view to concluding the testing of  registry systems prior to COP/MOP-1. The COP also requests the  Secretariat, as administrator of the ITL, to conduct standardized  testing and independent assessment and to report the results to  SBSTA-23, and recommends that COP/MOP-1 adopt a decision on the  role and functions of the administrator of the ITL.

###     Emissions projections from Annex I Parties

The issue was first  taken up by SBSTA in plenary on Tuesday, 7 December. Chair  Benrageb prepared draft conclusions. In plenary on Tuesday, 14  December, SBSTA adopted the conclusions without amendment.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.23),  SBSTA takes note of the report of the workshop on emissions  projections from Annex I Parties held in September 2004. SBSTA  notes that the report contains useful information on  methodological and reporting issues relating to greenhouse gas  projections and on experiences in dealing with general and  cross-cutting aspects of greenhouse gas projections, and also  addresses specific issues relating to all sectors. SBSTA notes  that the report also encourages Annex I Parties to take this  information into consideration when they prepare their next  national communications in order to enhance the transparency of  reporting.

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

This issue was first  addressed by SBSTA in plenary on Tuesday, 7 December. A contact  group co-chaired by Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and  Holger Liptow (Germany) met six times from 8-14 December, to draft  conclusions and decisions.

### UNFCCC FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Special Climate Change Fund: This  issue was first addressed by the SBI on Tuesday, 7 December. The  EU said a recent meeting of potential SCCF donors had resulted in  pledges for over US$30 million. Many countries welcomed the  pledges to the SCCF, but noted that they are insufficient to  adequately support efforts on adaptation to climate change and  response to disasters. AOSIS, the Africa Group, LDCs, and others  expressed concern over the interpretation of COP guidance to the  GEF, underlining that the most vulnerable countries face  difficulty in accessing GEF funds due to the burden of  co-financing requirements, the existence of additional criteria  and indicators not adopted by the COP, and the narrow scope of  adaptation projects eligible under the GEF. A contact group,  co-chaired by Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Jozef Buys (Belgium)  addressed this issue on Wednesday and Friday, 8 and 10 December,  and discussed developing countries' concerns about the GEF adding  conditions to access the SCCF.

Following informal consultations, SBI considered a bracketed draft  decision in plenary on Tuesday, 14 December. Parties were informed  that consensus had not been reached in the contact group, and  agreed to forward the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.25) to the  COP Presidency for further consultations. The draft decision  includes bracketed text referring to the activities that should be  funded by the SCCF, such as renewable energy, environmentally  sounds technology and development of advanced fuel technology.

Parties welcomed the GEF's leverage of  substantial co-financing resources and highlighted the importance  of identifying funds for the fourth GEF replenishment.

The contact group co-chaired by Rawleston Moore and Jozef Buys  also addressed this issue. Discussions centered on the parameters  for the review of the financial mechanism and funding needs for  developing countries to meet their commitments under the UNFCCC  for the next GEF replenishment. The G-77/China said that, in  accordance with the Memorandum of Understanding, the COP and GEF  should jointly determine the necessary funding. Many Annex I  Parties supported maintaining the existing modalities for  identifying funding.

On Tuesday, 14 December, SBI adopted conclusions on matters  relating to the implementation of decision 5/CP.8 and forwarded to  the COP Presidency a draft decision on assessment of funding to  assist developing countries in fulfilling their UNFCCC  commitments. On Friday, 17 December, the plenary adopted a draft  decision on this issue.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.24), SBI  invites Parties and intergovernmental organizations to submit to  the Secretariat, by 15 October 2005, information on their  experiences regarding the effectiveness of the financial  mechanism. It also requests the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis  report on the financial mechanism, based on submissions received  and other relevant documents.

###     COP Decision

###     Additional guidance to the GEF

This issue was first addressed by  SBI on Tuesday, 7 December. Many countries emphasized SIDS'  difficulties in accessing funds and suggested that the GEF should  be more flexible and provide support for small-scale projects in  SIDS. The contact group on the financial mechanism, co-chaired by  Rawleston Moore and Jozef Buys, addressed the issue and prepared  an omnibus decision on additional guidance to GEF. The COP adopted  the decision on Saturday, 18 December.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2004/L.17), the COP  requests the GEF to, inter alia, report on the support of  activities identified in the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on  Adaptation and Response Measures and continue to fund activities  relating to UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public  awareness).

###     Report of the GEF to the COP

SBI first addressed this issue on  Tuesday, 7 December. Many Parties raised concern over the  efficiency in the GEF's administrative costs, questioned  co-financing requirements, and stressed that the GEF must follow  the COP's guidance. Japan said the COP should provide guidance to  the GEF on project eligibility and criteria, but not on issues  related to the GEF's management. Chair Stoycheva prepared draft  conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.16), SBI  welcomes progress in implementing activities within the scope of  the New Delhi work programme on Article 6, reaffirms that  regional, subregional and national workshops are valuable fora,  welcomes offers of Uruguay and Japan to host regional workshops,  and recognizes that the particular needs of SIDS could be  addressed by organizing a pre-sessional workshop in conjunction  with SBI-23. SBI also encourages the prompt start of the first  development phase of the prototype information network clearing  house.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.16/Add.1), the COP  invites Parties and international organizations to support  workshops and the development and implementation of the  information network clearing house. It urges the GEF to continue  its work to improve access to, and visibility of, opportunities  for funding Article 6 activities, and decides that the New Delhi  work programme should continue to guide Parties implementing  Article 6. The COP also decides to undertake the full review of  the implementation of the work programme in 2007, and requests the  Secretariat to prepare a report for SBI-27 on progress achieved by  Parties in implementing Article 6, based on information contained  in national communications and other sources of information.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This issue was first addressed by SBI on  Tuesday, 7 December. The contact group on capacity building met  three times: the first two times it was co-chaired by Roger  Cornforth (New Zealand) and Shirley Moroka (South Africa). Jukka  Uosukainen (Finland) replaced Co-Chair Cornforth in the contact  group's third meeting. The contact group addressed the need for a  review of the implementation of the capacity-building frameworks  for developing countries and EITs.

On Tuesday, 14 December, SBI approved a draft decision on capacity  building for EITs and forwarded it to the COP. SBI was unable to  reach agreement on the draft decision for developing countries,  and forwarded the draft text to the COP for appropriate action.  After holding consultations on the draft text, the COP President  proposed a new draft decision. The COP adopted the two decisions  on Saturday, 18 December.

###     COP Decision

s: In the final decision on capacity building for EITs  (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.22/Add.1), the COP, inter alia, invites the GEF,  Annex II Parties and multilateral and bilateral organizations to  provide information regarding opportunities for technical and  financial support and encourages EITs to strengthen national  institutions to build capacity through training, public education  and awareness programmes. The COP also decides to review the  status of implementation of capacity building in EITs under  decision 3/CP.7 at SBI-27. The COP requests the Secretariat to  compile and synthesize information provided by EITs and Annex II  Parties for the review, and invites the GEF and others to also  provide information for the review.

In the final decision on capacity building for developing  countries (FCCC/CP/2004/L.11), the COP, inter alia, outlines key  factors that could assist in further implementing capacity  building, such as:prioritizing institutional capacity building; integrating capacity-building activities in planning  processes; raising awareness at various levels on climate change issues  and increasing the involvement of national governmental  organizations in capacity-building activities; ensuring that resources are made available for the  implementation of capacity-building activities; and improving international donor coordination in the provision  of financial resources.

The COP encourages Parties to improve implementation of  capacity-building activities, taking into account the above key  factors, and to report on the effectiveness and sustainability of  capacity-building programmes in their national communications. It  also requests the GEF to take into account the above key factors  when supporting capacity-building activities, and invites Annex II  Parties, multilateral, bilateral and international agencies, and  the private sector to continue providing financial resources to  support the capacity-building framework. The COP also decides to  initiate a second comprehensive review of the implementation of  the capacity-building framework at SBI-28, and requests the  Secretariat to, inter alia, cooperate with the CBD and UNCCD  secretariats to maximize synergies in implementing  capacity-building activities, prepare a synthesis report on the  steps to be taken to regularly monitor capacity-building  activities, and disseminate an information document on best  practices and lessons learned.

Discussions on this issue continued into the night on Friday,  17 December. In the COP plenary, early on Saturday, 18 December,  Parties adopted the decision, following extended discussions.  Issues discussed in plenary included, inter alia: whether the  adaptation programme of work discussed under SBSTA should focus  generally on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation or specifically  on impacts, vulnerability, and adaptation to climate change and  whether an expert meeting should consider the outcomes of the  workshop on insurance-related actions to address the specific  needs and concerns of developing country Parties.

###     COP Decision

The decision (FCCC/CP/2004/L.16), entitled the  Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures,  is divided into four parts: adverse effects of climate change;  impact of the implementation of response measures; further  multilateral work relating to activities under decision 5/CP.7;  and the SBSTA programme of work on impacts, vulnerability, and  adaptation to climate change.

On adverse effects of climate change, the COP decides to further  implementation of actions under decision 5/CP.7 on information and  methodologies, and vulnerability and adaptation. It requests the  GEF to report to COP-11 and subsequent sessions on relevant  activities of, inter alia, the LDC Fund and SCCF. It also requests  the Secretariat to organize, before COP-13, three regional  workshops, reflecting regional priorities, and one expert meeting  for SIDS, reflecting issues of priority identified by that group.  Regarding modeling, the COP encourages the IPCC to incorporate  regional-specific modeling information on adverse effects of  climate change in its Fourth Assessment Report.

On reporting, it requests Annex II Parties to provide detailed  information on progress made to meet the needs of developing  countries arising from the adverse effects of climate change,  encourages non-Annex 1 Parties to provide information on their  specific needs and concerns arising from the adverse effects of  climate change, and requests SBI-27 to, inter alia, consider  compilation and synthesis reports of national communications  regarding the adverse effects of climate change.

On the impact of the implementation of response measures, the  decision focuses on progress on implementation, modeling and  economic diversification, and reporting. Regarding progress on  implementation, the COP recalls that decision 5/CP.7 mandates GEF  support for response measures. On modeling and economic  diversification, it requests the Secretariat to organize two  expert meetings and that the outcomes be reported to SBI-25. On  reporting, it requests Annex II Parties to provide information on  progress made on support programmes for developing countries, and  developing countries to report on needs and concerns arising from  the impact of implementation of response measures. The COP also  requests SBI-27 to consider reports regarding the implementation  of response measures, and invites the GEF to provide feedback to  COP-12 on actions taken.

On further multilateral work relating to activities under decision  5.CP/7, the COP decides to assess the status of implementation of  UNFCCC Article 4.8 and decision 5.CP/7 and to consider further  action at COP-14.

On the SBSTA programme of work on impacts, vulnerability and  adaptation to climate change, the COP:requests SBSTA to develop a five-year programme of work on  the impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate change; requests the Secretariat to organize an in-session workshop  at SBSTA-22 to facilitate the development of the programme of  work; invites Parties to submit views to the Secretariat by 31  March 2005; and requests the Secretariat to compile the submissions for  consideration at SBSTA-22.

###     Matters relating to the LDCs

A  contact group chaired by Bubu Jallow (Gambia) and Ricardo Moita  (Portugal) met twice between 9-14 December and discussed, inter  alia, guidance to the GEF on the LDC Fund, the mandate of the LEG,  whether the LDC Fund should begin funding NAPA priority areas, and  whether the LDC Fund should leverage additional resources, provide  co-financing and build upon existing plans and programmes. During  these discussions, LDCs expressed concern over GEF co-financing  requirements, noting that decision 6/CP.9 (guidance on the  operation of the LDC Fund) provides for full funding of NAPAs. The  EU said co-financing emphasizes countries' sense of ownership over  projects. Agreement could not be reached on all issues. On  Tuesday, 14 December, SBI decided to forward the bracketed draft  decisions and conclusions to the COP Presidency.

On Saturday, 18 December, draft conclusions and two draft  decisions were presented to the COP plenary. The decision on  further guidance for the operation of the LDC Fund has bracketed  text instructing the LDC Fund to start funding other elements of  the LDC work programme. Canada, Norway, the EU and Switzerland,  opposed by many developing countries and LDCs, suggested deleting  the text and said that more time is needed to develop the criteria  for the LDC Fund before projects can be financed. Parties were not  able to reach an agreement and the draft decision  (FCCC/CP/2004/L.15) was forwarded to SBI-22 for further  consideration. The COP adopted conclusions on the status of  implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.9 (LDCs), and a decision on the  mandate for the LEG.

###     COP Conclusions

In the conclusions on the status of  implementation of Article 4.9 (FCCC/CP/2004/L.14), the COP notes  appreciation for the progress made in the development of NAPAs,  and requests the Secretariat to ensure that the issue of risk  assessment and micro-insurance for LDCs in the context of extreme  weather events is covered in the workshops referred to in the  Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures.

###     COP Decision

In the decision on the work of the LEG  (FCCC/CP/2004/L.13), the COP requests the LEG to prepare a mandate  with possible elements to be considered at SBI-23 on the role of  the LEG in support of the implementation of NAPAs, and potential  technical and financial difficulties that LDCs may have in the  implementation of NAPAs.

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.14), SBI  notes the lack of sufficient and predictable funding given to the  Secretariat for organizing workshops and notes the lack of  predictable funding as the main reason for delays in the  organization of workshops. It urges Parties to ensure that timely  and sufficient funding is available for workshops, and to make  contributions to the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities for  funding workshops. SBI also notes the need to ensure a balance in  participation of Parties in workshops and requests the Secretariat  to ensure that, for workshops already confirmed, invitations and  documentation are made available to participants in a timely  manner.

### OTHER MATTERS

Level of emissions for the base year of Croatia:  This issue was taken up by SBI on Monday, 6 December. Informal  discussions were facilitated by Jim Penman (UK). Conclusions were  adopted by SBI on Tuesday, 14 December, noting that discussions  will be continued at the next SBI session, as no agreement was  reached at SBI-21.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.21), SBI  agrees to continue its consideration of the level of emissions for  the base year of Croatia at the next session.

### IN-SESSION WORKSHOP

# COP PLENARY

### SECOND REVIEW OF ADEQUACY OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.2(A) AND (B)

The  issue of the second review of the adequacy of Annex I commitments  under UNFCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b) was taken up by the COP on  Monday, 6 December. President González García said he would  consult informally on the matter. No agreement was reached, and  the item remains in abeyance.

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP/MOP-1

Preparatory work relating to Protocol  Article 6: This issue was taken up by the COP on Wednesday, 8  December. The Russian Federation emphasized the need for Parties  to exchange information on, and prepare, JI project proposals. The  EU said efforts to make JI operational should be intensified. The  COP adopted conclusions in plenary on Friday, 17 December.

###     COP Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/CP/2004/L.3), the COP  invites Annex I Parties to make contributions to the UNFCCC Trust  Fund for Supplementary Activities in order to facilitate  preparatory work by the Secretariat in 2005 and draws attention to  the need to make nominations to the Article 6 Supervisory  Committee so that COP/MOP-1 will be in a position to elect its  members and alternate members.

### REPORT OF THE CDM EB

This issue was first addressed by the COP on  Monday, 6 December, and again on Wednesday, 8 December. A contact  group chaired by Raúl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) met three times  from 9-11 December. On Friday, 17 December, the COP adopted a  decision.

The issues discussed included: amending Rule 27 of the EB rules of  procedure on attendance at meetings; prioritizing energy projects;  increasing transparency; providing new baseline and monitoring  methodologies for types of project activities in sectors not yet  covered by approved methodologies; the implications of CDM project  activities for achieving objectives of other environmental  agreements; the status of the 'tools for the demonstration and  assessment of additionality;' and the need for text on arbitration  provisions and on protection for EB members and others from  liability.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2004/L.2), the COP:encourages the EB to continue to assess existing and new ways  to ensure transparency; recalls that the use of the 'tool for the demonstration and  assessment of additionality' is not mandatory for project  participants; and requests SBSTA, in collaboration with the EB, to develop a  recommendation to COP/MOP-1 relating to the implications of the  implementation of CDM project activities for the achievement of  the objectives of other environmental conventions and protocols,  in particular the Montreal Protocol.

The COP also encourages CDM project participants to make proposals  for new baseline and monitoring methodologies for types of project  activities in sectors not yet covered by approved methodologies,  including transportation and energy efficiency, and to intensify  its work to ensure the proper functioning of the CDM, by, inter  alia, developing a management plan. The COP also decides on  procedures for review and amends the EB rules of procedure,  adding, inter alia, text stating that the EB shall, where it  decides to limit attendance at its meetings, take all practicable  steps to accommodate non-Parties to the Protocol and others to  observe proceedings, except when the EB decides to close the  meeting or a portion of it.

### EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON UNFCCC ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO OTHER  INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

The COP first addressed this issue on  Monday, 6 December. Delegates considered input into the BPOA+10,  the WCDR, and the fourteenth session of the Commission on  Sustainable Development (CSD-14). The US, Saudi Arabia and others  disputed inclusion of this item on the agenda. Parties agreed to a  compromise changing the title of the agenda item and adding a  footnote stating that the exchange of views will be reflected in  the COP-10 report and serve to assist the Executive Secretary in  reporting to these meetings. The COP also addressed the issue in  plenary on Tuesday, 7 December, and in several contact group  sessions chaired by José Romero (Switzerland). The issues  discussed included: the type of report from the UNFCCC to these  processes, whether and how the UNFCCC should be kept apprised of  activities in these processes; and whether the actual views or  submissions of Parties should be referred to in the text. On  Friday, 17 December, Parties adopted a decision without amendment.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2004/L.2), the COP notes  that Parties held an exchange of views on UNFCCC activities  relevant to other intergovernmental meetings and requested the  Secretariat to report on these agreed activities to the BPOA+10,  WCDR, and CSD-14 meetings. It further requests the Secretariat to  report to SBSTA-22 on the BPOA+10, and to inform SBSTA-23 of  relevant activities of the CSD. Text referring to actual views or  submissions of Parties and reporting on the WCDR was not included.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Procedure for the  appointment of an Executive Secretary: In the COP Plenary on  Friday, 17 December, President González García said he would  continue to undertake consultations on this matter at a future  session.

### STATEMENTS

Statements by UN bodies and specialized agencies and  regional groups were heard on Wednesday, 15 December. A summary of  these statements can be found at  http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12258e.html.

Statements by observer organizations were heard on Friday morning,  17 December. The International Energy Agency noted that estimates  indicate that greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector are  still growing robustly and a variety of technologies need to be  developed, implemented and managed in a manner that meets energy  needs.

Noting that 80% of the climate change impacts from refrigerating  plants are due to energy consumption, the International Institute  of Refrigeration said that efforts are being made to make  refrigerators more energy efficient.

OPEC said that the adverse effects of policies and measures on  OPEC States must be considered, expressed concern about calls for  new climate change commitments for developing countries, and  stressed that developing countries cannot be expected to  prioritize mitigation over other more pressing needs.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  said the OECD advocates the use of market-based instruments to  reach environmental goals in an economically efficient manner,  emphasizing the OECD's ability to bring together economic, social  and environmental perspectives for finding solutions.

Commending actions taken over the past decade, the Asian-African  Group Legal Consultative Organization underlined the need for  further action in a spirit of cooperation.

The Asian Development Bank noted both the economic strides and  environmental degradation experienced by the Asia-Pacific region,  stressing that developing countries and aid organizations must  ensure that climate change issues are well integrated in their  strategies and programmes.

Local Governments requested that: CDM and JI rules include local  government policies that stimulate market transformation; the  UNFCCC acknowledge local government action; and the UNFCCC give  local governments special status at future UNFCCC events.

The Inuit Circumpolar Conference linked climate change to human  rights, and suggested that UNEP facilitate a dialogue among  residents of vulnerable areas, such as low-lying countries, small  island States and the Arctic.

Research and Independent NGOs stressed the need to open a dialogue  with policy makers. Global Unions supported more ambitious  reductions of greenhouse gas emissions as long as civil society  representatives are involved in the decision-making process. The  Business Council for Sustainable Energy stressed the importance of  market-based approaches to encourage greenhouse gas emissions  reductions, and the need to create opportunities for companies  from Protocol non-Parties to participate in the global response to  climate change. Business and Industry NGOs said climate change  solutions must take into account regional and local circumstances.  Foro del Buen Ayre expressed concern about possible restrictions  to civil society participation in the seminars planned for 2005.

The Climate Action Network urged the G-77/China to reject the  'roadblocks' erected by Saudi Arabia. The Union of Concerned  Scientists, on behalf of the Climate Action Network, said the next  negotiation round should concentrate on: further emissions  reductions by Annex I Parties; a more rapid deployment of clean  technologies in developing countries; and adaptation measures to  cope with the impacts of climate change. A representative of the  Mapuche People highlighted the need to improve participation by  indigenous communities in the UNFCCC process. The World Council of  Churches said 'beyond 2012' negotiations should focus on a  principle-based approach concentrating on an equitable allocation  of benefits and burdens, precaution, priority for the most  vulnerable, and maximum risk reduction.

# CLOSING PLENARY

Closed consultations continued past the scheduled closing of the  COP. Delegates addressed the outstanding issues in an attempt to  reach agreement on an entire 'package' that would include the  Seminar proposal, the adaptation work programme, details on the  LDC Fund and SCCF, and agreement on the implementation of decision  5/CP.7. At 5:54 am on Saturday, 18 December, delegates gathered in  the closing Plenary to adopt decisions and conclusions on  outstanding agenda items. COP-10 Vice-President Pomoshnikov  introduced the proposal on holding a Seminar of Government Experts  back-to-back with SB-22 to, inter alia, promote informal exchanges  regarding actions on adaptation and mitigation and P&Ms. In the  Seminar, all UNFCCC Parties will be entitled to make a  presentation. Participants may bring to the attention of the  Seminar publications offering supplementary data in support of  their presentations, and the Secretariat is invited to place the  texts of presentations and the supplementary data on its website.

India, supported by Saudi Arabia, China, and several other  G-77/China Parties and opposed by the EU, Russian Federation,  South Africa, AOSIS and several Annex I Parties, suggested that  the proposal be amended stating proceedings of the Seminar will be  made available by the Secretariat and are not intended to lead to  a process for further commitments by developing countries. Parties  considered compromise proposals made by Oman and Brazil. After two  rounds of informal discussions, Argentina proposed, and Parties  agreed, to add text stating that the proceedings of the Seminar  will be made available by the Secretariat to Parties for their  consideration, bearing in mind that this Seminar does not open any  negotiations leading to new commitments.

Parties then addressed the adaptation work programme, which had  been added to the decision on implementation of decision 5/CP.7.  After deliberations on reference to the workshop on insurance- related actions held in May 2003, and the title of the section on  the 'SBSTA programme of work on impacts, vulnerability and  adaptation,' which Tuvalu requested refer only to climate change,  Parties adopted the decision.

Finally, Parties discussed the decision on the LDC Fund. Following  informal consultations and Plenary discussions, Parties were  unable to reach agreement, and decided to forward the issue to  SBI-22.

COP Rapporteur Sylvia McGill presented the report of the session  (FCCC/CP/2004/L.1 and Add.1), which Parties adopted.

Vice-President Pomoshnikov presented a draft resolution on an  expression of gratitude to Argentina and people of city of Buenos  Aires (FCCC/CP/2004/L.5), which Parties adopted by acclamation.  The Gambia, for LDCs, recalled the vulnerability of LDCs to  climate change. Following additional closing statements thanking  Argentina as COP-10 host country, Vice-President Pomoshnikov  thanked participants and the Secretariat and gaveled the meeting  to a close at 10:57 am on Saturday, 18 December.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF COP-10 BUILDING A HOUSE

### CLIMATE CHANGE ARCHITECTURE

The year 2004 was a significant one for the UN Framework  Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. The year  marks the 10th anniversary of the entry into force of the UNFCCC  and, as such, many have been looking back with a sense of  accomplishment at the progress achieved over the past decade. In  addition, much of the world celebrated when the Russian Federation  ratified the Kyoto Protocol, ensuring the continuity of mitigation  efforts into the next decade as the Protocol enters into force in  early 2005.

To make sure that the 'house' is in order for the Protocol's  imminent entry into force, Parties gathered at COP-10 to complete  the unfinished business from the Marrakesh Accords. In addition,  they took the opportunity to reassess the building blocks of the  process and discuss the framing of a new dialogue on the future of  climate change policy. This brief analysis attempts to review the  UNFCCC process as it begins a 'new chapter,' examining the issues  of adaptation and mitigation, the needs of least developed  countries (LDCs), and future strategies to address climate change.

# MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION

### THE BRICKS AND MORTAR

COP-10 provided an opportunity for delegates to reinforce the two  main building blocks of the policy response to climate change:  mitigation and adaptation. In fact, for the first time, adaptation  featured equally to mitigation to the extent that COP-10 was  nicknamed 'the Adaptation COP.' One delegate, however, noted that  this was the third consecutive COP to have received this  undeserved nickname, suggesting that a more fitting name for  COP-10 would be the 'Adaptation Fiasco.' With several developed and developing countries providing  testimony on the rise in extreme weather events in their regions,  and other recent scientific assessments, such as the Arctic  Climate Impact Assessment, also drawing attention to climate  change impacts, it is becoming increasingly apparent that  adaptation is crucial, and countries will need to spend  considerable amounts of money to adapt to climate change and  recover from extreme weather events. Nevertheless, others  expressed caution, asserting that there is no proof of connections  between extreme weather events and climate change. Reaching an  agreement on the 'adaptation package' was therefore an arduous  struggle and the urgency to respond to the impacts of climate  change was not evident during the negotiations.

While many delegates were agreeable to providing support for small  island developing States (SIDS) and the LDCs to adapt to the  devastating impacts of climate change, a deadlock resulted due to  the demands of some States to address impacts from response  measures as the world moves away from fossil fuels. During a long  Friday night, which extended into Saturday morning, at the end of  the COP, there were several moments when delegates doubted that a  suitable arrangement could be found that balanced the demands for  support for addressing impacts of response measures and support  for adaptation to the adverse effects of climate change. In the  end, an adaptation package was adopted that facilitates, inter  alia, the further implementation of measures for adaptation to the  adverse effects of climate change and facilitates further  activities on modeling and economic diversification regarding the  impacts of response measures. In a climate in which some saw  little chance for agreement, this compromise text is likely a  success since no one was particularly happy.

# CRACKS IN THE ROOF

Least developed countries - some of the most vulnerable to the  impacts of climate change - failed for the second consecutive year  to secure a decision for full-cost funding of adaptation through  the Global Environment Facility (GEF). All financial resources for  the LDC Fund are channeled through the GEF. The problems  encountered by the LDC Fund shed light on the core problem of  addressing adaptation in the context of the UNFCCC. Adaptation is  an integral part of development, and as such, no project directed  at adaptation will fall squarely within the scope of the UNFCCC,  but will rather have components that include other aspects of  development, such as disaster preparedness, water management,  desertification prevention, or biodiversity protection. This  problem was highlighted with great honesty by a GEF project  director who said that when projects fall under many categories,  rather than being easily adopted due to their clear synergies and  multiple benefits, they become more complex and difficult to  approve due to a series of successive revisions needed by  different focal areas.

To add to this problem, adaptation projects are generally built  on, or embedded in, larger national or local development projects  and, therefore, the funding by the GEF would only cover a portion  of the costs. In other words, if a country seeks funding for a  project on flood prevention, the GEF would only be able to finance  a portion proportional to the additional harm that floods have  caused or will cause as a result of climate change, and the rest  would have to be co-financed by some other body. The plea from  LDCs, particularly the SIDS, lies precisely on this paradox, in  that even if funds are available in the LDC Fund, their difficulty  of finding adequate co-financing, and the costly and cumbersome  calculation of the additional costs, renders the financial  resources in the LDC Fund, in practice, almost inaccessible.

The question to be asked is whether UNFCCC Parties are willing to  provide the institutional flexibility needed to address complex,  urgent issues that defy traditional approaches to development aid.  Fundamentally, some say that transfer of financial resources to  LDCs is not directly a climate change issue, but is in fact a  development issue that maybe should be dealt with elsewhere.  Others do not seem to be in any hurry and are willing to allow the  financial mechanism all the time it needs to find a suitable  solution for the operationalization of these funds, including the  creation of funding criteria. Those most vulnerable have a  different view on the urgency of the matter, but it is evident  from the COP-10 outcomes that LDCs lack the bargaining power of  oil-producing countries and large greenhouse gas emitters. If the  UNFCCC is to take a strong stance on adaptation for the most  vulnerable, LDCs will have to find ways to regain bargaining power  within the negotiations and present feasible proposals that fit,  however loosely, in the existing financial architecture. Developed  countries, on the other hand, will need to speed up the analysis  of this issue within the GEF and come up with creative solutions  that give the GEF the will and flexibility it needs to address  this problem.

# BLUE PRINT FOR POST-2012

The recently released report of the UN High-Level Panel on Threats,  Challenges and Change underlines that countries must take action  and commence negotiations for long-term strategy to address  climate change. Moreover, the Kyoto Protocol requires that Parties  initiate consideration of post-2012 commitments by 2005. The  challenge presented to delegates at COP-10 was how to engage  non-Parties to the Protocol in this process and how to ease  concerns of many developing countries regarding the imposition of  new commitments. Delegates struggled behind closed doors over the  issue of exactly when and how to discuss future commitments, and  opinions varied widely. Some wanted a series of informal meetings,  or seminars, to openly discuss the future of the climate regime.  But a few countries felt it was inappropriate to discuss future  commitments altogether, and in some discussions countries appeared  to try to limit the discussion of climate change issues to the  UNFCCC process and not show links to other processes, such as the  International Meeting for the 10-year Review of the Barbados  Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small  Island Developing States (BPOA+10), the World Conference on  Disaster Reduction (WCDR) or the UN Commission on Sustainable  Development (CSD).

With recent national election results in mind, several NGOs,  meanwhile, urged delegates to move ahead without non-Parties to  the Protocol in the hope of raising the lowest common denominator  of consensus and promoting more progressive future commitments.  After a full night of intensive consultations on the last day of  the COP, delegates agreed to have one seminar in 2005 that would  not open negotiations leading to new commitments. However, it was  noted by some that the text did not preclude the initiation of  such discussions on the basis of the seminar's outcomes.

The outcomes of the seminar, according to one expert, will  ultimately depend on the skills of the organizers to bring  together Parties in an environment that enhances both trust and  frank exchange of views and perhaps moves beyond the technical  foci of recent COP meetings. Some NGOs and scientists have already  voiced concern that the process may lack transparency and called  for wider civil society access. As it stands, only government  experts can participate. These seminars will also fall amidst a  number of other very important processes taking place in 2005,  such as the review of progress in the implementation of the  Millennium Declaration, initiation of the review by the CSD of the  implementation of existing climate change commitments, changes to  the COP Bureau and a new Chair of the G-77/China - Jamaica. The  UK, with its plans to prioritize climate change issues, also  embarks on the Presidency of the Group of Eight and the EU. All  these events will undoubtedly influence the direction and outcomes  of the seminar.

# CONCLUSIONS

Until the 11th hour, many remained pessimistic about the potential  for a deal at COP-10. The agreement on seminars was not only a  victory for Argentina, but was also an important internal policy  marker for some Parties. With the agreements on seminars and  adaptation, and completion of land use, land-use change and  forestry issues, it is safe to say that although many issues  remain unresolved, much has been achieved in the past ten years.  However, what has become crystal clear at COP-10 is that some  Parties are not ready to embark on post-2012 negotiations. For  now, the best that can be hoped for is that Annex I Parties will  begin to comply with their emissions reduction commitments and  implementation of Protocol mechanisms. If Annex I Parties prove  that emissions reductions are possible and compatible with  development, if carbon markets and/or other tools and incentives  are in place so other Parties can see the benefits of  participating, and if the costs of climate change impacts start to  accrue significantly, the international community may be ready to  take further steps in the coordinated global response to climate  change.
