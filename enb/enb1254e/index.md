# OBSERVER BRIEFING

The Chair of the QELROs non-group, Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho  (Brazil), said delegates were working on a draft text on  coverage that will reflect the non-group's exchange of  views, but he said it was too early for negotiations. He  said distribution of QELROs among Annex I Parties was at a  similar stage, with delegates reiterating proposals from  their formal presentations.

Also undecided is the possibility of a specific objective  under a protocol, whether to include a long-term  stabilization target, and whether to describe the objective  in terms of global atmospheric GHG concentrations or other  measures such as temperature or sea-level rise. He said it  is likely that AGBM-7 will conclude with bracketed text on  the different approaches.

Takao Shibata (Japan), Chair of the institutions and  mechanisms non-group, said delegates had completed a first  discussion of all issues before the non-group. He said two  proposals had been considered regarding entry into force of  a legal instrument: basing it on the number of  ratifications as in the FCCC; or weighting entry into force  by percentage of GHG emissions by Parties. The emissions- based approach could tie entry into force to Parties'  percentage of all global emissions or of those by Annex I  Parties.

AGBM Chair Ra√∫l Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) said the non- group on Article 4.1 was working to clarify the meaning of  certain paragraphs in its draft and revise the text to show  where the lack of agreement exists. He said the non-group  on policies and measures would attempt to reconcile two  approaches, including one presented in a paper by the  European Union. The positions are currently far apart and  will need considerable discussion.

Estrada said an extended Bureau meeting Tuesday had  addressed organizational and substantive issues. He noted a  clear general trend not to establish a new objective for a  protocol but to keep the objective now in the FCCC. He also  said delegates preferred not to develop new principles.  This would simplify negotiators' work and avoid potential  years of discussion.

Asked whether the AGBM agreement would be likely to define  a dangerous level of CO2 concentrations, Estrada said it  did not seem appropriate to include, in a legal instrument,  values that could change over time in light of scientific  research. Responding to a question whether a global cap  would follow global distribution or vice versa, the Chair  said that political negotiations of this sort usually aim  at results. He said the agreement is first produced and  then explained. The philosophy follows the results.

# NON-GROUP ON INSTITUTIONS AND MECHANISMS

At a morning meeting, the non-group on institutions and  mechanisms had a lengthy discussion on a Chair's text  containing a short and long version of the draft Preamble.  On the short version, some Parties argued for  simplification and clarification of references to the  Berlin Mandate. This triggered calls from Parties concerned  about economic impacts on fossil fuel producers for the re- introduction of paragraphs in the long version to meet  their concerns. The disputed text, including amendments,  remains in brackets.

On the questions of decision-making and whether the FCCC  COP should also serve as the COP of the Protocol or other  legal instrument, some Parties argued against any overlap  in the functions of the FCCC COP. They proposed a Meeting  of the Parties to the Protocol, to be held only in  conjunction with the FCCC COP. Decision-making on the  Protocol would be restricted to the Parties to the  instrument. The Chair undertook drafting a new text  incorporating a proposal from a regional group.  On the role of the Secretariat, arguments were presented  for flexibility to allow the Secretariat to take on  additional functions.

# NON-GROUP ON POLICIES AND MEASURES

The non-group on policies and measures met in the morning  to consider a draft text proposed by the Chair containing  two alternatives. In one, commitments would be fulfilled  individually. The other allows for the possibility of  common/coordinated policies and measures. An initial  exchange of views took place on the text, and some  amendments were made to the second alternative. In general,  delegations noted the considerable difference between the  two alternatives in terms of content. Some delegations  suggested that the solution to this would be the inclusion  of an intermediate alternative.

A group of countries requested that a proposal it had  presented previously as a non-paper be included in the  draft as a third alternative. Several delegations objected  to this and indicated that the proposal had been duly  reflected under the second alternative. Other delegations  also regretted not seeing their proposals included in the  text. One of the proposals pertained to guidelines for  P&Ms, while others referred to national action plans and  performance indicators.

To allow the inclusion of proposals of a differing nature  under the same alternative, the title of the section was  changed to a more general one on 'Policies and Measures.'  On the second alternative, a delegation said that while  coordinated action should not be excluded, it should not be  mandated either. Several delegations suggested changing the  framework and structure of this alternative. A group of  countries suggested that some principles and guidelines  should frame the section on policies and measures.

A group of countries noted the need to change the first two  paragraphs under the second alternative on policies and  measures to better reflect the proposals upon which they  were based. There was a discussion on whether a reference  to a subset of Parties under Annex I should be included in  the paragraph on cooperation to establish coordinated  cross-sectoral, cost-effective policy instruments. In the  afternoon, delegations engaged in informal consultations on  how differing proposals were to be included under the same  alternative.

In the evening hours, the non-group reconvened and was  presented with two new documents by the Chair on general  provisions and alternatives for policies and measures.

The document on alternatives for policies and measures,  refers to the types of P&Ms that countries listed in an  'Annex Q' shall adopt or give priority to. Types of  policies and measures have been classified under different  lists (A, B and C). It was agreed that paragraphs on  voluntary policies and measures would be deleted, and that  P&Ms under list B would be 'coordinated' instead of  'specific'.

Regarding the document on general provisions, a proposal  was made to replace paragraphs in the text on the  development of national plans for the limitation and  reduction of anthropogenic emissions by sources and the  incremental rate of removal by sinks. A paragraph was  included on the discretion Parties shall have to select  those policies and measures that are best suited to  national circumstances for meeting their emission  limitation and reduction commitments. It was agreed that  the Chair would present the AGBM plenary a revised draft  text, based on the discussions of the non-group.

# NON-GROUP ON QELROS

The non-group on QELROs began consideration of a revised  negotiating text. Several delegates asked for discussion to  be suspended until the following day to give Parties a  chance to read and consider the text. On the purpose of the  agreement, one Party proposed that QELROs should apply to  the weighted average global warming potential based on a  one hundred year time line of anthropogenic emissions  rather than simply the weighted total. On methodologies,  one Party noted that it has still not been decided whether  the methodologies will be decided upon by the Conference of  Parties or Meeting of Parties.

On criteria for the addition of GHGs to the Annex, a  delegate proposed that the criteria should be considered as  suggested rather than mandatory. One delegation proposed  that the Parties shall review and revise global warming  potentials and methodologies. On the nature of target and  baseline, many delegations were confused as to the various  options outlined in the text. One delegation was concerned  that the text had been drafted so that budget periods were  inherently linked to flat rate targets with no  consideration of budget periods for differentiated targets.  The chair suspended the meeting while several delegations  discussed the text. No agreement was reached by the  delegations and the meeting was adjourned.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Wednesday's observer briefing ended with the AGBM Chair's  comments that the trend of discussion at the extended  Bureau meeting was to apply only the FCCC's objective to a  Protocol. Within minutes of the announcement, reports of  counter trends emerged from some of the interested players  who had participated in the Bureau meeting. Some said that  a decision to limit the Protocol's objective to that set  out in the FCCC could have implications for those proposals  from regional groups and other Parties that stipulate or  propose the development of formulae for setting a ceiling  on GHG emissions based, for example, on sea level and  temperature rises. Chair Estrada has, reportedly, argued  that the introduction of a new objective may cause  confusion.    A number of the interested Parties suggested that the  matter had not been resolved, and proposals containing new  objectives would stay on the table at the AGBM. One  regional representative said 'we have not given up.' They  marked Estrada's announcement down to 'forceful  chairmanship' and suggested that he was somewhat ahead of  the Parties in his reading of Tuesday's meeting. Some also  conceded that, in principle, it would be advisable to  restrict the introduction of new objectives but arguments  would be made for an exception nonetheless. Others said  that using the same FCCC overall objective would still  leave room to incorporate proposed new objectives, perhaps  within the section on emissions limitations and reduction  objectives. An interested Party has reportedly been tasked  to conduct consultations in an effort to merge the new  proposals.
