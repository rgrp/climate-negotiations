# COP

### DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

PAPUA NEW GUINEA introduced  a proposal on avoiding deforestation in developing countries  (FCCC/CP/2005/MISC.1). Parties welcomed the proposal, while  several noted the issue's complexity and need for thorough  consideration. TUVALU drew attention to potential perverse  incentives and links between the climate change regime and  deforestation, and stressed the need for innovative thinking on  possible action post-2012 under Protocol Article 3.9 (future  commitments). BRAZIL supported exploring incentives for addressing  sustainable development and, with TUVALU and others, opposed  opening up the Marrakesh Accords. The US suggested that the  proposal relates primarily to the Protocol. Jamaica, for the  G-77/CHINA, underscored common but differentiated responsibilities  in addressing climate change and sustainable development. Hernán  Carlino (Argentina) will chair a contact group.

### ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS

Procedure for  Appointing an Executive Secretary: President Dion outlined the  procedure for selecting a new UNFCCC Executive Secretary, as set  out in recent correspondence from the UN Secretary-General's  office. He noted that the procedure is the one used for all senior  UN appointments, and said the COP Bureau looks forward to being  consulted by the Secretary-General on the appointment. The COP  took note of these arrangements.

# COP/MOP

### ADOPTION OF DECISIONS FORWARDED BY THE COP

President Dion  introduced a package of 21 decisions forwarded by the COP to the  COP/MOP as part of the Marrakesh Accords. Delegates adopted the  package, including decisions on LULUCF and matters relating to  Article 3.14 (adverse effects), Articles 5 (methodological  issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of  information), the flexible mechanisms, and accounting of assigned  amounts under Article 7.4 (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3 and Adds.1-4).  Describing the adoption as a 'landmark achievement' resulting from  seven years' hard work, he thanked delegates for approving a  'clear rule book' for the Protocol.

CANADA said these decisions will 'breathe life' into the Protocol  and provide the basis for implementation. He suggested that the  next step should be improvement, particularly in the operation of  the CDM and through technology transfer.

### OTHER MATTERS

The EU introduced a request by Italy to reconsider  its assigned amount for forest management (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/MISC.2).  Consultations will be held.

### REPORT OF THE CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

Sushma Gera, Chair of the CDM  Executive Board, presented the Board's 2004-2005 report  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/4 and Add.1). Noting 'significant momentum' over  the past year, she reported that 39 CDM projects have been  registered, with a large number in the pipeline. She outlined  steps to streamline work and reported on the management plan,  concluding that the goal of the prompt start of the CDM has been  realized.

Many Parties highlighted the importance of the CDM and supported  greater efficiency to expedite the process. Most emphasized the  need for adequate funding for the Board and associated bodies,  while several stressed the need to send a signal to the market on  the CDM's continuation after 2012.

India, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted recent accomplishments,  including the awarding of the first certified emissions reductions  (CERs). JAPAN said projects for district heating, energy  efficiency and transport should be encouraged. COLOMBIA and GHANA  drew attention to CDM potential in the transport sector. The EU  noted the linking of the EU emissions trading scheme to the Kyoto  mechanisms, and concerns that the CDM process needs to be improved  to deliver projects and CERs on the scale sought by Parties.

CANADA stressed the Board's 'strategic oversight' role and the  pressing need for a package of CDM-strengthening measures. NEPAL  and CAMBODIA raised the issue of non-renewable biomass, while  BRAZIL and AOSIS underscored the need to maintain CDM's  environmental integrity.

PANAMA noted concerns on the proposal to finance the Board through  CDM proceeds, and endorsed the idea of sectoral CDM. Tanzania, for  the AFRICA GROUP, called for measures to improve African  participation in the CDM, such as channeling CDM proceeds to  capacity building in the region. CHILE, supported by several  others, proposed extending the Marrakesh Accords deadline for  registering prompt start CDM projects.

The International Emissions Trading Association, speaking for  BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY groups, called for a significant reform  package, including new guidance on additionality. David Brackett  (Canada) and André Corrêa do Lago (Brazil) will co-chair a contact  group.

### JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (JI)

On implementation of Protocol Article 6  (JI), the EU urged prompt agreement on practical measures to  operationalize JI, and stressed the EU's commitment to securing  adequate and prompt payment of the costs. Several Parties  emphasized the value of learning from the CDM. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION said financial sources for the JI Supervisory Committee  should come from contributions from Annex I Parties and  registration fees for JI projects. He identified the need to  define small-scale JI projects and called for a COP/MOP 1  decision. China, for the G-77/CHINA, underscored clear guidelines  for 'real and measurable' reductions. Daniela Stoytcheva  (Bulgaria) will chair a contact group on JI, and Marcia Levaggi  (Argentina) will hold consultations on membership of the  Supervisory Committee.

### COMPLIANCE

On the Protocol's compliance mechanism, SAUDI ARABIA  noted its proposal to amend the Protocol and called for an  independent, legally-binding instrument. The EU, supported by  others, said the compliance procedure should be adopted by a  COP/MOP 1 decision, and should be operationalized without delay,  after which an amendment could be considered. The G-77/CHINA  said an amendment process could be initiated at COP/MOP 1.  CANADA cautioned that such a process could be unpredictable. The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION said adoption of the compliance mechanism by  a COP/MOP 1 decision would imply a recommendatory rather than  legally-binding system. JAPAN opposed an amendment. Harald  Dovland (Norway) and Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso) will  co-chair a contact group.

### ARTICLE 3.9 (FUTURE COMMITMENTS)

Parties stressed the importance  of initiating a process on this issue. CANADA, SWITZERLAND and  other Parties called for broad participation, while ZIMBABWE and  others noted that Article 3.9 refers specifically to Annex I  countries. CHINA suggested an Ad Hoc Working Group, and TUVALU  called for a world summit on climate change. Greenpeace,  speaking for environmental NGOs, called for a 'strong response.'  The G-77/CHINA presented a draft decision to initiate discussions  on an amendment to Annex B. David Drake (Canada) and Alf Wills  (South Africa) will co-chair a contact group.

### QUANTIFIED EMISSION REDUCTION COMMITMENT FOR BELARUS

BELARUS  indicated that it is seeking to define its quantified emission  reduction commitment as 95 per cent of the 1990 level, and to  introduce a corresponding amendment to Annex B of the Kyoto  Protocol. President Dion, with assistance of Andrej Kranjc  (Slovenia), will hold informal consultations.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Contact group Chair Crispin D'Auvergne (Saint  Lucia) invited comments on implementing Article 6 (education,  training and public awareness). The US suggested synthesizing  results of recent workshops. On the new CC:iNet online information  clearinghouse and funding issues, the EU said CC:iNet needs  ongoing funding and that submissions could be requested in 2006 on  all Article 6 issues, including CC:iNet. The David Suzuki  Foundation, for CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK, said NGOs can play a cost- effective role in implementing Article 6. Chair D'Auvergne said  draft text would be prepared by Thursday morning.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Delegates met in a contact group in the  morning and informally in the afternoon in an attempt to agree on  the draft COP decision on the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF).  Much of the discussion was on a proposal by the G-77/China to  include research and development in the transport and energy  sectors in the priority areas to be financed by the SCCF. The  group will continue to meet informally to resolve outstanding  issues on the draft decision before addressing other matters.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Co-Chairs Holger Liptow (Germany) and Carlos  Fuller (Belize) asked participants to provide initial thoughts on  this issue. The US, EU and JAPAN supported adopting the 2006 Work  Plan of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) as  proposed, while Malaysia and Ghana, both speaking for the  G-77/CHINA, suggested some additions. Discussion focused on an  EGTT paper on publicly-owned technologies and technologies in  the public domain, and on holding a high-level round table. The  Co-Chairs will prepare draft text.

### COMPLIANCE

The contact group decided to hold informal  consultation to consider a draft decision proposed by the AFRICA  GROUP, which has one operational paragraph on adoption of  compliance procedures in Decision 24/CP.7 and another on  commencing an amendment process. SAUDI ARABIA insisted on linking  both topics, while the EU questioned the rationale for considering  an amendment now when prompt operationalization of the compliance  mechanism is essential for implementing the Protocol and CDM.  JAPAN opposed the amendment.

### ADAPTATION

Co-Chair Kumarsingh presented a draft COP decision on  the SBSTA programme of work on impacts, vulnerability and  adaptation, which includes an annex setting out the objective,  expected outcome, scope of work, process and modalities, and  specific activities. Delegates discussed, inter alia, how to  include reference to the most vulnerable Parties and how to refer  to integration into sustainable development. The G-77/CHINA, AOSIS  and others called for an action-oriented programme of work as  opposed to continuing assessments.

### COMMON REPORTING FORMAT (CRF) FOR LULUCF

The US suggested  reporting net national totals including all sources and sinks.  The UK, CANADA and AUSTRALIA opposed this and stressed the need  to distinguish sinks in the reporting to ensure transparency and  comparability. AUSTRALIA, with TUVALU, called for a focus on  emissions and removals instead of on stock changes. On how to  address unmanaged lands, TUVALU cautioned that distinguishing  between managed and unmanaged lands is inconsistent with the  UNFCCC and stressed the need to account for all sources. María  José Sanz (Spain) will facilitate informal discussions.

### CRITERIA FOR CASES OF FAILURE TO SUBMIT INFORMATION ON LULUCF  UNDER THE PROTOCOL

Co-Chair Rosland noted various issues that  needed to be addressed, including defining the proper basis for  measurement, establishing thresholds, and whether to have separate  criteria for omissions. JAPAN suggested taking into account  adjustments and 'conservativeness factors' already applied to  LULUCF reporting and, with the EU, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA, called  for a simple, effective and comparable approach. Informal  consultations will be held.

### MATTERS RELATING TO LDCS

Delegates discussed a new mandate and  terms of reference for the LDC Expert Group (LEG), focusing on  clarifying how the LEG will assist LDCs in implementing NAPAs, and  the length of the LEG's new mandate. Samoa, for the LDCs, said the  LEG's mandate should be three years, while the EU, US, JAPAN and  others preferred two years. The Co-Chairs will prepare a draft  decision and consult informally prior to it being considered by  the contact group on Friday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Corridor chatter on Wednesday started with rumors that Bill  Clinton and Al Gore might make an appearance next week to push the  agenda along. By lunchtime the focus of many delegates had shifted  to relief and pleasure at the COP/MOP's adoption of the Marrakesh  Accords, which some had quietly feared might prove difficult. By  the close of the day, though, the mood had turned sour for some  following Saudi Arabia's insistence on amending the Kyoto Protocol  at this COP/MOP - an issue many fear could prove among the most  difficult to manage in the days ahead. This prompted one delegate  to suggest that Clinton and Gore's presence might indeed help to  'save the day.'
