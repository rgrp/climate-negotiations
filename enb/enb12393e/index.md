# AWG-LCA

## LONG-TERM COOPERATIVE ACTION:

Chair Machado noted that a number of contact groups had met to discuss the assembly document, which deals with a shared vision, mitigation, adaptation, and delivering on technology and financing. He indicated that there had been 164 submissions in total for the assembly text, amounting to more than 1000 pages of input. He said this demonstrates the active interest and engagement of parties, and that this updated text will provide a strong basis for work in 2009 (FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/16/Rev.1).

## WORK PROGRAMME FOR 2009:

Parties adopted conclusions developed during informal consultations convened by AWG-LCA Vice-Chair Cutajar ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/L.10 ).

The AWG-LCA adopted conclusions ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/L.11 ).

## STATEMENTS FROM OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS:

The INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY called for, inter alia quantifiable mid and long-term emission reduction targets for industrialized countries; actions by developing countries to reduce emissions below business-as-usual scenarios; and incentive structures for technology transfer. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES expressed concern over REDD and proposed an expert group on indigenous peoples and climate change.

## REPORT OF THE SESSION:

Chair Machado thanked delegates and all involved in the AWG-LCA s work, and parties adopted the report of the session ( FCCC/AWGLCA/2008/L.9 ).

## RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION:

The SBSTA adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.18).

###     Greenhouse gas inventories

Parties adopted the SBSTA conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.20).

###     Greenhouse gas data interface

SBSTA Chair Plume informed the plenary that consideration of this item would continue at SBSTA 30.

Parties adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.15).

METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES (PROTOCOL): HCFC-22/HFC-23: Co-Chair Spooner reported that parties had been unable to agree. The item will be taken up again at SBSTA 30.

###     CCS under the CDM

Co-Chair Wollansky reported that parties had considered two bracketed options, but that differences remained on forwarding bracketed text to the COP/MOP or to a later SBSTA session. Parties adopted short draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.21) and this matter will be taken up in SBSTA 30. The EU, SAUDI ARABIA, AUSTRALIA, NORWAY and JAPAN expressed regret that agreement had not been reached. JAMAICA noted that CCS technology is not ready for use in an offset mechanism such as the CDM. BRAZIL highlighted concerns relating to long-term permanence and host-country liabilities.

## IPCC:

SBSTA adopted conclusions on IPCC AR4 (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.17).

## PROTOCOL ARTICLE 2.3:

The SBSTA took this matter up in plenary following a joint SBI/SBSTA contact group session on Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 held earlier in the day. In the contact group, parties had been unable to agree on forwarding substantive draft conclusions to SBI and SBSTA. Instead, they accepted a short text acknowledging the importance of addressing matters related to Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14, and agreeing to continue discussions in a joint contact group at SB 30. During the closing plenary, Co-Chair Tilley reported that more time was needed to address these issues. Parties adopted the brief conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2008/L.24).

## OTHER MATTERS:

## STATEMENTS FROM OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS:

TRADE UNIONS urged increased financial support for adaptation. YOUTH said REDD must not be used as a mechanism by which Annex I countries avoid their domestic emission reduction obligations.

## REPORT OF THE SESSION:

The Secretariat outlined cost implications of SBSTA outcomes, noting that most would be covered through core resources or the Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities. He noted that a request for a technical paper on REDD would require voluntary contributions amounting to US$100,000.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates emerged from the final plenary of the subsidiary bodies on Wednesday evening with seemingly mixed feelings. Most appeared to feel that the AWGs and SBs had achieved at least the minimum that was needed. We got what we came here for, although many might have wanted more, said one delegate. There were some small wins here but no big breakthroughs. Still, few expected any, said another. Some were pleasantly surprised that the AWG-KP had finished its work at a reasonable hour, especially since some sections of the work programme had apparently not been agreed when the text was brought to plenary. There was a range of views on the work programme in particular, depending on which delegation was speaking. Meanwhile, in some of the remaining COP/MOP negotiations, the Article 9 review group was reporting slow progress at 11:00 pm Wednesday night. However, delegates leaving the Adaptation Fund talks at a similar hour were reporting some forward momentum, with the legal status of the Board as the only major outstanding issue.
