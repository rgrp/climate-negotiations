# COP PLENARY

### OPENING SESSION

COP-9 Vice President Mamadou Honadia (Burkina  Faso), on behalf of COP-9 President Miklós Persányi (Hungary),  introduced Ginés González García, Argentine Minister of Health and  the Environment, who was elected President of COP-10 by acclamation.  President González García emphasized that COP-10 is the last  session prior to the Kyoto Protocol's entry into force and the  first session of a new chapter devoted to taking action. He stated  that advanced research and knowledge must be accompanied by  increased resources, and that commitments from all members of  society are needed. Anibal Ibarra, Mayor of Buenos Aires, welcomed  participants to Buenos Aires and highlighted the central role of  local authorities in responding to climate change and raising  public awareness.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter highlighted the  tenth anniversary of the UNFCCC and the forthcoming entry into  force of the Protocol. She presented a report of the UNFCCC's  first decade, underlining the challenges that lie beyond 2012 and  suggested that Parties consider an equitable and effective  strategy to ensure that all countries contribute fairly to  achieving the UNFCCC's objectives.

Numerous speakers welcomed the Russian Federation's ratification  of the Protocol and expressed hope that the US would also ratify  the Protocol. QATAR, for the G-77/China, noted the impacts of  recent climate-related disasters on developing countries, and  called for renewed commitment by the international community. He  said that adaptation, technology transfer and capacity building  should remain high on the policy agenda. He emphasized Annex I  Parties' responsibility for financial resource mobilization for  adaptation, stressing the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities.

The NETHERLANDS, for the EU, Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey,  expressed continued commitment to addressing climate change and  highlighted the launch of the EU emissions trading scheme in  January 2005. He supported limiting global temperature rise to  2 degrees Celsius, noting that a greater increase would result in  irreversible damages. TUVALU, for the Alliance of Small Island  States (AOSIS), highlighted the need for strong linkages with the  10-year review of the implementation of the Barbados Programme of  Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing  States (BPOA+10) and the World Conference on Disaster Reduction  (WCDR), and emphasized the importance of dialogue on adaptation.

Noting that the first commitment period is only an initial step,  SWITZERLAND, for the Environmental Integrity Group, urged Parties  to consider ways and means to address climate change challenges  beyond 2012. KENYA, for the Africa Group, stressed the need for  progress in the implementation of decision 5/CP.7. TANZANIA, for  the LDCs, expressed concern at the slow disbursement of funds for  the preparation of national adaptation programmes of action  (NAPA). The RUSSIAN FEDERATION explained that Protocol  ratification had been a difficult decision for his country.  NIGERIA informed Parties of his country's impending ratification  of the Protocol. The COMOROS noted that adaptation is crucial for  many vulnerable countries. SAUDI ARABIA said that targets for the  second commitment period should be limited to Annex B Parties, and  should not include developing country Parties. EGYPT stressed the  need to promote funding, technology transfer and CDM activities.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

President González García informed Parties  that the Kyoto Protocol now has 129 ratifications and will enter  into force on 16 February 2005. He stated that despite  intersessional consultations, Rule 42 (voting) of the rules of  procedures remains unresolved, and said he will conduct informal  consultations.

President González García then introduced the provisional agenda  for adoption. CANADA withdrew its proposal on cleaner energy  exports, in the spirit of moving discussions forward. The EU,  opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed deleting the agenda item on  matters relating to Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of  policies and measures).

The US, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and opposed by ARGENTINA, AOSIS,  the EU and MAURITIUS, disputed discussion on inputs from the COP  to the BPOA+10 and WCDR. Following informal discussions, Parties  agreed to consider an 'exchange of views on UNFCCC activities  relevant to other intergovernmental meetings,' with a footnote in  the agenda stating that the exchange of views will be reflected in  the COP-10 report and serve to assist the Executive Secretary in  reporting to these meetings. Parties adopted the agenda, with  Article 2.3 and the review of Article 4.2(a) and (b) (Annex I  commitments) held in abeyance.

The election of officers other than the President is postponed  until nominations have been finalized. The COP approved the  admission of organizations as observers. Regarding the date and  venue of COP-11 and the procedure for the appointment of an  Executive Secretary, Parties agreed that further consultations are  necessary. President González García said he will prepare a  non-negotiated summary of the high-level panel discussions.

# SBSTA

### OPENING

SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya) opened SBSTA-21,  noting that Arther Rolle (Bahamas) will continue to serve as SBSTA  Vice-Chair and Ibrahim Al-Ajmi (Oman) as Rapporteur. Delegates  adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/7).

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Good practice guidance for LULUCF: AUSTRALIA,  supported by the EU, US, JAPAN and CANADA, looked forward to  continued discussions on harvested wood products (HWP). AOSIS said  that reporting and accounting for HWP should be driven by good  science and not by market incentives. AUSTRALIA, supported by  CANADA and JAPAN, tabled a written proposal for an open-ended  policy dialogue on LULUCF and the EU recommended that SBSTA hold a  LULUCF workshop in 2005. CANADA, supported by JAPAN, EU and NORWAY,  urged the adoption of the good practice guidance at COP-10.  William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Audun Rosland (Norway)  will co-chair a contact group on the issue.

###     Small-scale A&R CDM:

The Secretariat presented a proposal for a  draft decision on modalities and procedures for small-scale A&R  CDM, and on measures to facilitate their implementation. SENEGAL  stressed the need to guarantee benefits to low income communities.  JAPAN, supported by CANADA, said simplified modalities and  procedures are necessary to reduce transaction costs, and the EU  said simplified modalities and procedures should avoid  overestimating carbon credits or compromising the Protocol's  environmental integrity. URUGUAY stressed the importance of  synergies with other conventions. A contact group will be  co-chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Jim Penman (UK).

###     Emissions from aviation and maritime transport:

Chair Benrageb  noted that SBSTA-20 was unable to come to an agreement on this  issue. Several delegations expressed concern about the rapid  increase of emissions in the aviation sector. AOSIS urged greater  progress in methodologies to attribute and account for aviation  and maritime emissions in the second commitment period.  SWITZERLAND, opposed by the US, welcomed discussions on allocating  emissions from international aviation and maritime transport. The  US and CANADA said inventory issues should be taken up at SB-22.  INDIA said allocation is a political issue that should be  addressed by the UNFCCC and IPCC, not by the International Civil  Aviation Organization and International Maritime Organization.  Informal consultations, facilitated by Eduardo Calvo (Peru), will  further address this issue.

### R&SO

The Secretariat presented the 'Implementation plan for the  global observing system for climate in support of the UNFCCC,' and  the Global Climate Observing System presented its activity report.  SWITZERLAND proposed that the IPCC take note of SBSTA conclusions  on these matters and consider them in its Fourth Assessment Report.  Stefan Rösner (Germany) and Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu (Mauritius)  will co-chair a contact group on this issue.

# SBI

### OPENING

SBI Chair Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria) opened SBI-21.  Delegates adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBI/2004/11) without amendment.  On election of officers, Emilio Sempris (Panama) will replace  Gonzalo Menéndez (Panama) as SBI Rapporteur, and Fadhel Lari  (Kuwait) will continue to serve as SBI Vice-Chair.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

Progress on the  implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7: The  Secretariat noted that the draft decision discussed at SBI-19 and  SBI-20 remains bracketed in its entirety. The UN Conference on  Trade and Development pointed to its work related to decision  5/CP.7, including on LDCs, capacity building, trade and  development. ARGENTINA said that the discussion on decision 5/CP.7  provides a good opportunity for advancement on adaptation. He  expressed concern about shortcomings in the bracketed draft SBI  decision on the agenda item, noting for example that SBSTA's  bottom-up approaches to adaptation are not reflected in the draft  decision. BANGLADESH proposed regional workshops to address  developing countries' capacities to cope with climate change.  AOSIS called for workshops on insurance options for SIDS.

SAUDI ARABIA and NIGERIA stressed the need to address both the  impacts of climate change and of response measures. AUSTRALIA  highlighted the need for disseminating information on climate  change impacts at regional and local levels. Noting that climate  change may affect the achievement of the Millennium Development  Goals, the EU underlined the need for a decision to assist  vulnerable countries to address adverse effects. Describing locust  problems in the Sahel, MALI stressed the need to strengthen early  warning systems. Chair Stoycheva said a contact group on the issue  will be established, and the co-chairs will be announced on  Tuesday, 7 December.

###     Matters relating to LDCs:

The Secretariat presented an update of  the work of the LDC Expert Group (LEG). He announced that  Mauritania is the first LDC to submit a NAPA and that many  countries are finalizing their NAPAs. LEG Chair La'avasa Malua  (Samoa) presented the LEG's meeting report, highlighting the  completion of a draft recommendation on LDC capacity-building  needs. TANZANIA, for the LDCs, emphasized the need to strengthen  national focal points and institutions and to ensure that the LEG  continues to provide guidance during NAPA implementation.  MAURITIUS called for adequate support for LEG activities during  2005.

The EU suggested that discussions on LDCs should take into account  deliberations on decision 5/CP.7, in order to avoid duplication.  Opposed by UGANDA, SWITZERLAND proposed conducting a compilation  and synthesis of the first NAPAs. AOSIS urged the implementation  of NAPAs immediately following their completion. Bubu Jallow (the  Gambia) and Ricardo Moita (Portugal) will co-chair a contact group  on this issue.

### OTHER MATTERS

Level of emissions for the base year of Croatia:  The Secretariat explained that Croatia's greenhouse gas inventory  was reviewed in September 2004. CROATIA, supported by the EU,  expressed hope that the issue of Croatia's level of 1990 emissions  will be resolved at COP-10. BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA noted acceptance  of the review findings. SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO expressed  reservations concerning the report, and requested further  consideration of the issue during COP-10. Jim Penman will  facilitate informal consultations on the matter.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With the Russian Federation's ratification and the long anticipated  entering into force of the Kyoto Protocol on the horizon, delegates  entered Plenary on Monday morning with positive spirits. Several  participants welcomed the cooperative attitude shown by Canada on  its withdrawal of its perennially controversial agenda item on  cleaner energy exports. With one or two countries voicing  dissatisfaction with an agenda item on inputs to BPOA+10 and WCDR,  some expressed concern that this may be a premonition of future  debates in those processes and feared attempts to play down links  between climate change and disasters.

Looking forward to the next two weeks, several participants also  pointed out that adaptation will be a hotly contested issue.
