# SBSTA

The final meeting of SBSTA-15 was held in the afternoon, with the  report of the session and the following conclusions being adopted  without discussion: ongoing activities on reporting and GHG  inventories from Annex I Parties; emissions resulting from bunker  fuels; good practice guidance for LULUCF; emissions from forest  harvesting and wood products; technology transfer; cooperation  with relevant international organizations; education, training and  public awareness; AIJ; and the special circumstances of Croatia.

On organizational matters, delegates elected Philip Weech (the  Bahamas) as SBSTA Vice-Chair and Tatyana Ososkova (Uzbekistan) as  SBSTA Rapporteur. On methods to evaluate impacts and adaptation,  the conclusions were amended to include reference to 'global and  regional' international organizations. The conclusions on issues  relating to hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons were amended  to provide for China's proposal that only 'Annex I' Parties be  encouraged to update information on means for limiting such  emissions. The conclusions relating to Canada's proposal on  cleaner or less greenhouse gas emitting energy were adopted, with  the EU emphasizing the need for well defined terms of reference  for the workshop.

On P&Ms, the EU proposed reference to the October 2001 workshop  report, rather than to its terms of reference. SAUDI ARABIA,  opposed by POLAND, SWITZERLAND, CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC and  CANADA, advocated deleting a paragraph inviting Parties to  consider and submit their views on the workshop, and on further  action to advance the work on P&Ms. Following discussion, the  original conclusions were adopted, with the EU expressing  reluctance in doing so.

On the conclusions relating to the IPCC Third Assessment Report  (TAR), SAUDI ARABIA and KUWAIT proposed deferring the issue to  SBSTA-16. The EU and others urged adoption of the conclusions.  Following further informal consultations, compromise text was  agreed. References to assessing 'the implications' of the TAR were  deleted, and the scope of the proposed workshop on the TAR was  amended to include reference to 'scientific uncertainty' and to  the 'effects of measures.'

# SBI

SBI met in the afternoon to resume consideration of its agenda. On  organizational matters, delegates elected Daniela Stoytcheva  (Bulgaria) as SBI Vice-Chair and Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) as SBI  Rapporteur. On matters referred to the SBI by the COP, delegates  adopted the draft conclusions on the report of the GEF. The SBI  then agreed to recommend to the COP a decision amending the Annex  II list by removing Turkey and inviting Parties to recognize its  special circumstances as an Annex I Party. On Kazakhstan's  proposal to add its name to Annex I, the SBI adopted conclusions  whereby the COP notes that Kazakhstan, inter alia, becomes an  Annex I Party for the purposes of the Protocol upon ratification.

On the date and venue of COP-8, Karsten Sach (Germany) reported  that two Parties were still considering hosting it. Delegates then  adopted draft conclusions on the calendar of meetings of  Convention bodies 2005-2007 and on feasibility of developing  guidelines for the review of Annex I national communications, and  recommended to the COP a draft decision on the review of the third  national communications and the roster of experts. The SBI  forwarded to the COP a draft decision on the third compilation and  synthesis of initial national communications from non-Annex I  Parties. On the CGE, Contact Group Chair Ojoo-Massawa stressed  that paragraphs relating to NAPAs and the LDC Expert Group  remained bracketed pending discussions in the LDC group. Approval  of the relevant draft decisions was deferred.

Delegates also adopted: draft conclusions on the provision of  financial and technical support; the draft report of the CGE; the  programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003; and recommendations  on the interim financial performance for 2000-2001. On  administrative and financial matters, delegates noted that  possible options to respond to late payment of contributions had  not been agreed, with delegates deciding to forward the matter to  SBI-16. On the implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, no  further progress was reported, and this item was concluded at SBI- 15.

Chair Ashe noted that consideration of the report of the session,  matters relating to LDCs and the CGE would be deferred to the next  SBI meeting on Thursday.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The negotiating group on Articles 5,  7 and 8 met in the morning to work on outstanding issues. JAPAN  highlighted its proposal on the review for reinstatement of  mechanisms eligibility. Several Parties supported the proposal,  but suggested elaborating the issue at a subsequent SBSTA session.  JAPAN agreed to discuss the proposal bilaterally to reach some  basic agreement and introduced another proposal on review of the  compilation and accounting report to assess Article 3.1 (assigned  amount) compliance.

On the Article 8 draft COP decision, delegates agreed on language  requesting SBSTA-16 to commence consideration of guidelines on new  and additional topics, including some left unresolved at SBSTA-15.  On the draft Article 7 COP/MOP-1 decision, delegates agreed to  delete a subparagraph making failure to submit information on the  commitment period reserve a mechanisms' eligibility criteria.

Delegates then turned to outstanding LULUCF issues in the Article  7 guidelines and the related COP/MOP-1 decision. After extensive  discussion, including compromise proposals from several Parties  and Chair Dovland, the LULUCF package was forwarded to ministers,  with the main area of contention being whether the LULUCF  principles as included in the Bonn Agreements should lead to  specific, mandatory reporting requirements within the Article 7  guidelines or should remain preambular guiding principles.

On the issue of loss of mechanisms' eligibility in the draft  Article 7 COP/MOP-1 decision, Parties considered an EU package  proposal on thresholds that, inter alia, involves loss of  eligibility following failure to submit an annual inventory or to  include an estimate for a source category of seven percent or  more. Delegates provisionally agreed to the EU proposal pending  the outcome of relevant discussions in the mechanisms group.

Regarding reporting under Article 7.2 (national communications) on  P&Ms, delegates failed to agree on whether reporting shall take  into account relevant decisions by the COP and COP/MOP.

Resuming in an evening session, the group considered the bracketed  text on review of information under Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse  effects) in guidelines under Article 8. Chair Dovland highlighted  a compromise proposal supporting annual as well as periodic  reporting and review of information under Article 3.14, and said  the key starting point is whether such reporting should trigger  loss of mechanisms eligibility. Parties did not reach agreement on  this. On a new Russian proposal on confidentiality, Parties raised  concerns and the issue was not resolved. On supplementarity in the  guidelines under Article 7, the US, supported by CANADA,  highlighted the lack of legal context of a Chinese proposal  specifying the aim of reducing per capita emissions differences  between developed and developing countries. Work is expected to  continue in informal consultations.

### COMPLIANCE

The negotiating group on compliance met in an evening  session to consider the new Co-Chairs' non-paper on compliance, an  'EU/Umbrella Group proposed compliance package,' as well as new  text for a draft COP decision. CANADA introduced the package  proposal, highlighting that it focused on trigger, appeal,  compliance action plan and suspension of eligibility to make  transfers under Article 17. The G-77/CHINA and the ENVIRONMENTAL  INTEGRITY GROUP supported the package. The NETHERLANDS then  reported on the outcome of consultations on outstanding issues not  reflected in the Co-Chairs' new non-paper. On the mandate of the  facilitative branch, he reported agreement on the deletion of  wording specifying that it was 'the only branch' responsible for  addressing questions of implementation. On the consequences  applied by the facilitative branch, he said delegates had agreed  that these be applied 'taking into account,' rather than 'on the  basis of,' the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities and respective capabilities. Delegates agreed to  the new Co-Chairs' non-paper on procedures and mechanisms, as  amended. Everton Vargas (Brazil) then reported on consultations he  facilitated on the draft COP decision and recommended that the  group adopt his proposed draft decision, with an editorial  amendment. Delegates agreed, thus completing the work of the  negotiating group.

### MECHANISMS

Delegates met in a brief morning session of the  negotiating group. Co-Chair Estrada said the Co-Chairs would hold  bilateral informal consultations in order to produce a new text on  mechanisms that should be acceptable to all Parties. He also said  that the drafting group on Article 7.4 chaired by Murray Ward  would continue its work, starting with the third part of the non- paper on modalities for the accounting of assigned amount which  tackles the issue of compilation and accounting of emission  inventories and assigned amounts.

Delegates reconvened in an evening session to hear feedback from  the Co-Chairs on new text on unresolved mechanisms and Article 7.4  issues. Co-Chair Estrada reported that progress had been made on  key issues relating to the commitment period reserve, the  transaction log, eligibility criteria, and definition of units,  including the removal unit. However, divergence still remained on  several areas. On Article 7.4 negotiations, Chair Ward reported  that unresolved differences still existed on the third part of the  non-paper. The meeting ended with Parties agreeing to forward a  new Co-Chairs' text on mechanisms to Plenary, with the  understanding that several countries had not agreed to the draft  text.

# PLENARY

In a late evening Plenary, COP-7 President Elyazghi invited the  negotiating group Chairs to report on progress. Compliance group  Co-Chair Slade reported that the text had been fully agreed and,  with Co-Chair Dovland, thanked all delegations. Mechanisms group  Co-Chairs Estrada and Chow reported progress, although some  'controversial' issues from the three drafting groups remained in  the text to be submitted to ministers. On Articles 5, 7 and 8,  Chair Dovland highlighted two issues delegates had been unable to  resolve, namely reporting on LULUCF activities, and review and  consequences of failure to report on Article 3.14. He suggested  that, with the completion of the work on compliance, this issue  might be more easily resolved, and noted that the group's work on  Article 7.4 could not be finalized until related work in the  mechanisms group had been completed.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

There was both joy and disappointment at COP-7 Tuesday night as  negotiators cut a deal on compliance but fell short of the mark on  the mechanisms and Articles 5, 7 and 8. Although there were  handshakes and hugs as the compliance group finished its work,  some observers were already speculating on possible trade-offs  involved in securing the deal. The mood in the mechanisms group  was more muted. Although the Co-Chairs' new text is free of  brackets, it was apparent that a number of key issues had yet to  be resolved. On an optimistic note, however, some said that  although the paper was not an agreed document, it was better to  have a clean text that was not universally supported than one  littered with brackets.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

COP-7's High-Level Segment will begin with a  welcoming ceremony at 10:00 am in Salle des Ministres. At 3:00 pm  in Plenary I, ministers and other heads of delegation will begin  to make official statements, which will continue over the next two  days.
