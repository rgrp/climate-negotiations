# SBI/SBSTA JOINT SESSION

A joint SBI/SBSTA session considered work on cooperative  mechanisms. Contact group Co-Chair Ivo de Boer (Netherlands)  reported that the group had met three times to: identify issues  related to the mechanisms; consider a work programme; and  suggest decisions. The group mandated a Co-Chairs' paper,  submitted as a proposed schedule of work.

The G-77/CHINA, supported by the PHILIPPINES, SAUDI ARABIA and  CHINA, called upon SBSTA to clarify methodological issues before  substantive issues are discussed. He also: noted, with CHINA,  the G-77/CHINA's current consideration of this item; called for  consideration of rules, guidelines and modalities and other  relevant issues; and, with the PHILIPPINES, opposed establishing  another contact group on similar issues. The Chair stated that  the two groups' work should be harmonized.

The EU introduced a proposal on international emissions trading,  noting differences to the Canadian proposal in addressing:  supplementarity; environmental effectiveness, compliance  mechanisms, market transparency, risk and liability rules,  reporting requirements, and eligibility.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

The Chair invited continued discussion on arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings, including arrangements for COP-4 and  the calendar of meetings. He noted a General Assembly (GA)  resolution asking conferences to avoid collisions with GA  meetings. After discussion, the Secretariat noted governments  will have to decide how to address this. On COP-4's provisional  agenda, the US said an item on voluntary commitments by non- Annex I Parties should be retained. The G-77/CHINA, supported by  BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA and BURKINA FASO, said there was no group  support for an item on voluntary commitments and, with  CHINA,called for transparency in drafting high-level statements.  JAPAN and CANADA supported the item on voluntary commitments for  non-Annex I Parties. JAPAN noted a prospective proposal on  incentives. CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA and BURKINA FASO, said this  item could lead to renewed confrontation. The EU called for a  prioritized work program for Protocol activities. A number of  outstanding questions remain, such as on implementation of  commitments other than those in FCCC Article 4.2. The Chair will  undertake informal consultations toward a draft conclusion and  decision.

On implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 with Decision  3/CP.3 and Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14, ZIMBABWE, for the G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, INDIA, VENEZUELA and  ETHIOPIA, called on the SBI to identify the needs of developing  countries, requesting information from SBSTA and the IPCC. She  called for a contact group to prepare a draft decision. She  proposed that the item be taken up at all future COPs and  proposed establishing a joint SBI/SBSTA working group. The EU  welcomed the Secretariat's document (FCCC/SBI/1998/CRP.1) and  noted the need for further analysis. On the paper's analytical  framework for Articles 4.8 and 4.9, he said there was an  overstatement of the certainty of information on adaptation.  Possible actions were not restricted to funding, insurance and  technology transfer. The SBI would not reach definitive  conclusions by COP-4, which could initiate work by SBSTA. The US  anticipated dramatic improvements in the state of knowledge  concerning adaptation in the years ahead. He noted that the FCCC  contains no provision similar to Article 4.4 obliging Annex I or  Annex II Parties to compensate countries that could be affected  by response measures. Any such obligation could have created a  perverse disincentive to reduce GHGs. Instead, FCCC Article 4.8,  on response measures, implies that, if possible, Parties should  implement commitments while avoiding or minimizing impacts on  developing country Parties. He noted the relevance of Protocol  Article 2.3.

Regarding a call for Annex I Parties to submit information on  potential impacts of policies and measures (P&Ms), he suggested  that those whose own interests are at stake are better situated  to identify impacts. In the absence of examples, he said it was  premature to consider establishing a new subsidiary body. He  said the possible impacts of response measures would be best  raised individually by affected Parties. There could be no  compensation for alleged adverse affects from implementation of  Article 4 commitments. On adverse effects of climate change, and  supported by CANADA and AUSTRALIA, he advocated starting with  each Party's own assessment of its vulnerability in initial  national communications. CANADA undertook to provide adaptation  technology through the CDM. AUSTRALIA favored more work on the  Secretariat's proposed analytical framework and anticipated  working through the CDM. SAUDI ARABIA said complexity in other  issues areas had not been given as a reason for deferring work.  He expressed surprise at innovative interpretations of Articles  4.8 and 4.9 and the Protocol provisions. NORWAY supported CANADA  and AUSTRALIA and underlined the importance of cost effective  implementation. ZIMBABWE clarified that the G-77's proposal  calls for an ad hoc working group to meet during the COP.

CHINA called for action on funding and technology transfer,  noting these are not to be limited to the CDM. Responding to a  US request for clarification on contradictions in P&Ms, SAUDI  ARABIA, supported by VENEZUELA, noted GHG-intensive energy  subsidies and taxes, and commitments to reduce petroleum use  alongside increasing domestic production. GEORGIA noted the  readiness of many non-Annex I countries to take on voluntary  commitments on GHGs, with adequate support under Article 4  within the framework of CDM. A contact group Co-Chaired by Tibor  Farag√≥ (Hungary) and Salamat Mohmad Salamat (Iran) will discuss  the G-77/China's draft decision.

The US called for constructive dialogue on the flexibility  mechanisms and noted the similarities between the UK and  Canadian papers on emissions trading. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  said differences in group positions on trading could be  narrowed. JAPAN suggested that the contact group reconvene in  light of G-77/China's willingness to engage. CANADA said a  prompt decision on the mechanisms was critical for encouraging:  ratification of the Protocol; early reductions; and reduced  cost. On the EU and Canadian papers, he noted commonality on  reporting, monitoring and verification. The PHILIPPINES asked  for clarification about the role of the contact group and, with  INDONESIA, expressed concern about the ability of small  delegations to participate in contact groups. The Co-Chair drew  attention to a Secretariat paper on organization of work  (FCCC/SBI/1998/1). He said all that was required was an  endorsement of proposals on which subsidiary body was to deal  with which issue. The CENTRE FOR INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAW  (CIEL) said there were issues regarding the mechanisms of grave  concern to the environmental community. CIEL did not envisage  that emissions trading would be used to evade responsibilities  or weaken commitments. He offered sets of principles for the  operation of the mechanisms.

The SBI considered a draft conclusion on national communications  from Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/1998/CRP.2). An EU proposal for a  draft COP-4 decision on revised guidelines was not supported. A  SWISS proposal not to limit submission of Parties' views to 'the  scheduling of' subsequent communications was accepted.

On a draft conclusion on involvement of NGOs  (FCCC/SBI/1998/CRP.3), the US, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and  VENEZUELA, the EU, and CHINA, deleted a request for additional  information on the objectives of NGOs. The EU supported existing  arrangements accrediting three NGO constituencies. SAUDI ARABIA,  supported by CHINA and VENEZUELA, proposed that 'Parties' rather  than 'Chairmen' agree on NGO participation in informal contact  groups. Delegates accepted a US compromise allowing  participation unless the group objects.

# AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13

AG13 continued deliberating Paragraph 13 (outcome), specifically  questions on the reporting of the Committee, access to the  reports of the work of the Committee, and whether reports should  be subject to consent of Parties concerned.

The US and G-77/CHINA questioned the need to link paragraph 11  (governance) and 13 (outcomes), since they address two distinct  issues: general reporting of the Committee's overall work and  reporting of the outcomes of that work. On reporting of the  Committee's work, the US queried the frequency, form and content  of reports to the COP. The G-77/CHINA and the EU suggested  annexing a summary of conclusions and recommendations to full  reports. The reports would be submitted at the ordinary sessions  of the COP.

On the G-77/CHINA suggestion to make the reports, conclusions  and recommendations available to the public upon request, IRAN  and the US noted the Secretariat's existing dissemination  procedures. CANADA called for cross-reference to paragraph 5  (mandate of the Committee) and avoid use of language that  expands or confuses the mandate of Committee. On consent by  Parties, the G-77/CHINA noted the importance of doing so  especially in situations where the concerned Parties did not  trigger the process, saying this is necessary for fairness and  appropriate acceptance of the conclusions.

The G-77/CHINA also proposed noting that the outcome of the  Committee's work shall include, as necessary, measures for the  effective implementation of the Convention. CANADA and the US  said the G-77/China proposal changes the scope of the process,  by referring to the entire Convention rather than the Parties in  question. GHANA said comments from the MCP participants should  be included in the report to the COP. The EU said the comments  should be included if they diverge from the outcome of the  process.

On paragraph 14 (evolution), delegates accepted text noting that  these terms of reference may be amended by the Conference of the  Parties. The Chair proposed that unresolved problems should be  resolved in a drafting group.

CANADA, Chair of the drafting group, reported that Parties had  agreed the MCP can be triggered by: a Party with respect to its  own implementation; a group of Parties with respect to their own  implementation; a Party or group of Parties with respect to  implementation by another Party or group of Parties; and/or the  Conference of Parties. On paragraph 13 (outcome), language was  included that allows for concerned Parties' comments on the  conclusions and recommendations to be forwarded with the report  to the COP. The group agreed to defer decisions on the size and  representation of the Committee to the final AG13 sessions, to  allow further consultations. At the end of the session the  delegates received a revised draft text.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Industry lobbyists are looking for clearer indications from the  Parties as to their expected role under Article 17 on emissions  trading. Some have pointed out that, until now, the private  sector's role has been assumed but far from assured. The  spectrum of interests and positions within the industry lobby  converge around the general concern that maximum flexibility be  built into the flexibility mechanisms so that the free market  can 'get on with it.' 'There's the Protocol and there's real  life,' commented one observer on the key role of the markets.  There is some skepticism about the level of capping flagged by  the EU.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

Some delegates voiced concern about the contact groups' progress  or the lack thereof. On flexibility mechanisms, details from  developing country delegates on a G-77/China position were  sparse and frequently far from optimistic. Some were dismayed  that emissions trading discussions are overshadowing those on  the CDM. Others feared that discussions on the CDM would not  address all developing countries equally. Still others cautioned  that contact groups designated last week have not yet met, while  new groups may proliferate.
