Earth Negotiations Bulletin coverage of groups on implementation  of decision 5/CP.7 and mitigation ended at 9:30 pm.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### LULUCF GPG

Parties continued deliberations on a draft COP  decision. On the common reporting format (CRF), informal group  facilitator Maria Sanz (Spain) reported that progress had been  made, except for on methods for units for land identification.  BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, requested more time to address this  matter. CANADA, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and EU stressed the  importance of adopting the CRF at SB-20. The G-77/CHINA, with  AOSIS, requested bracketing the title of the draft decision,  pending further discussion.

On harvested wood products, Parties agreed to SBSTA draft  conclusions outlining the objective of the workshop to be held in  Norway in August/September 2004.

On other LULUCF issues, AUSTRALIA, opposed by the EU, G-77/CHINA,  AOSIS and CANADA, proposed alternative text on recommending a COP  and COP/MOP draft decision to exclude degradation and devegetation  in the first commitment period.

On factoring out, the US and JAPAN, opposed by the G-77/CHINA and  AOSIS, welcomed an alternative proposal by AUSTRALIA and CANADA  that addresses LULUCF issues broadly. The G-77/CHINA and AOSIS  preferred to base work on the Co-Chairs' proposal. The EU  suggested basing discussion on the Co-Chairs' proposal, while also  considering Australia's proposal. Co-Chair Audun Rosland said  further discussions on GPG and other LULUCF issues would be held  in informal meetings.

### R&SO

This contact group was co-chaired by Stefan RÃ¶sner (Germany)  and Sok Appadu (Mauritius). Delegates considered draft  conclusions. Parties agreed to the US proposal that the GCOS  Secretariat report on support received from the financial  mechanisms of the UNFCCC and other bilateral and multilateral  agencies, rather than just on support received from the GEF.  Delegates discussed timing for the GCOS report on implementing  regional action plans relating to global observing, agreeing on  SBSTA-21 and subsequent sessions as appropriate. Parties agreed  on the importance of further considering the need to assess the  adequacy of research activities and international coordination  thereof to meet the UNFCCC's needs.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Parties addressed three outstanding  paragraphs of the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, completing their  deliberations. Delegates agreed to a reference to the results of  the TT:CLEAR survey. Parties also agreed to: request Annex I  Parties to provide technical support for technology needs  assessments; invite relevant organizations to hold regional  workshops to assist developing country Parties in finalizing their  technology needs assessment reports; and encourage the  organizations to assist developing country Parties in the  development of databases of national/regional technology needs  assessments. Following a break for informal consultations on the  possible elements of a COP-10 decision, Parties agreed to an  amended version of the US proposal.

### SMALL-SCALE A&R PROJECTS UNDER THE CDM

Delegates continued  consideration of the non-paper. The INDIGENOUS PEOPLES  ORGANIZATIONS called for clearly reflecting, in the project design  document, the aim to provide additional benefits to low-income  communities based on prior consultation, and for involving local  communities and distinguishing project participants from project  stakeholders.

Chair Thelma Krug reported on agreement among Parties to address  leakage by applying a discount factor under certain circumstances,  while assuming non-leakage under others. She also reported that  quality assurance and quality control in monitoring would fall  under the CDM EB's responsibility.

Reference to bundling remains bracketed throughout the text.  TUVALU and several other Parties suggested that wording on project  'categories' be clarified. Delegates discussed reference to  low-income communities and individuals in the paragraph on the  validation by the designated operational entities. This paragraph,  as well as Appendix B on baseline and monitoring methodologies,  was bracketed and will be addressed in informal consultations.

### ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION

In the afternoon, delegates considered  draft conclusions on adaptation, including topics for  consideration at SBSTA-21, namely regional climate modeling, risk  perception, and linkages between adaptation and sustainable  development. CHINA, opposed by SWITZERLAND, said SBSTA-21 should  focus on additional topics, including scientific, technical and  socioeconomic aspects of climate change impacts. SUDAN, supported  by MALI, suggested addressing adaptive capacity. BANGLADESH  emphasized livelihood adaptation and, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION,  regional climate modeling on impact assessment and prediction.  SAUDI ARABIA suggested considering adaptation to impacts of  response measures. MALI emphasized the importance of considering  poverty reduction. CANADA called for a more detailed focus on  sustainable development.

ARGENTINA, supported by SWITZERLAND and SAUDI ARABIA, proposed  requesting the Secretariat to compile information on existing  regional climate circulation models, methodologies for determining  vulnerability, and methodologies for formulating adaptation  projects. The EU and US noted potential resource implications.  UGANDA, opposed by the US, said decision 10/CP.9 (adaptation and  mitigation) mandates SBSTA to do more than merely facilitate  information exchange among Parties.

Parties decided to finalize the list of topics at a later stage  and agreed to request the Secretariat, under the guidance of the  SBSTA Chair, to organize a workshop and in-depth discussion to  facilitate the exchange of information and sharing of experiences  on them. Delegates also discussed Parties' submissions and  workshop reports. Co-Chair Warrilow said informal consultations  would address the topics for consideration at SBSTA-21.

In the evening, delegates considered draft conclusions on  mitigation, continuing deliberations into the night.

### P&MS

Delegates discussed the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions. SAUDI  ARABIA, for the G-77/China, requested adding reference to adverse  effects of the implementation of P&Ms. The EU, supported by the  US, proposed direct wording from decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms). The  G-77/CHINA, with JAPAN and CANADA, welcomed the EU's proposal, but  requested it in writing. Co-Chair Tony Surridge said the Co-Chairs  would prepare draft conclusions incorporating the proposals to be  discussed informally.

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Delegates agreed to the draft conclusions  proposed by Chair Dechen Tsering, after references to a technical  meeting to complete the first comprehensive review were replaced  by references to a meeting of practitioners, to be held at SBI-21.  Chair Tsering presented elements for a draft decision to be  negotiated at SBI-21. JAPAN said the decision should highlight the  activities supported by Annex II Parties. AUSTRALIA proposed  reference to future opportunities. TANZANIA, for the G-77/China,  called for the review to consider, among other things, how  developed countries and the financial mechanism have responded to  UNFCCC articles and COP decisions on capacity building. Responding  to a query from ROMANIA, Chair Tsering said capacity building in  EITs would be addressed in a separate draft decision.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Parties discussed draft conclusions presented by  Chair Markus Nauser. Delegates discussed whether to include  consolidated views of Parties and guidance to the Secretariat on  the further development of the UNFCCC information network clearing  house for Article 6 in an annex to the conclusions. The  Secretariat informed Parties that making a call for tenders for  developing the clearing house without assurance of the  availability of necessary funds is not feasible. Parties expressed  disappointment.

Delegates then discussed the date for submission and content of  the reports on implementing the New Delhi work programme, debating  whether these should be compiled or synthesized by the Secretariat,  and how the information in the reports would relate to information  provided in national communications. The G-77/CHINA requested the  inclusion of a paragraph pointing to the availability of GEF  funding to support Article 6 activities in non-Annex I Parties.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Chair Sok Appadu invited  delegates to present views on compromise text proposed by the EU  following informal consultations, and proposals from the G-77/China,  the US and Saudi Arabia. The EU proposal requests non-Annex I  Parties to submit funding proposals for national communications  even in advance of substantial completion of previous national  communications, but not later than one year after the submission  of their previous national communications. BRAZIL, for the  G-77/China, expressed concern about the one-year deadline.

Responding to a proposal by Chair Appadu calling on non-Annex I  Parties to submit national communications every four years, the  G-77/CHINA said that while some Group members had considered six  years to be a reasonable option, he did not have the mandate of  the G-77/China to present this as a formal Group position.

The proposals were compiled and bracketed, along with the EU  proposal for a three-year cycle for national communications. Chair  Appadu encouraged Parties to consult informally and present  written text.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

Delegates negotiated text  compiled from previous discussions and informal consultations.  Co-Chair Paul Watkinson pointed out that six paragraphs in the  preamble were covered by decision 5/CP.7. The US, supported by the  EU, G-77/CHINA and CANADA, agreed to delete the paragraphs, and  add text welcoming progress made in the implementation of decision  5/CP.7, while acknowledging the need to address gaps. KENYA, for  the G-77/China, suggested additional text to note difficulties in  assessing progress.

On financial and technical support, the G-77/CHINA said it would  introduce new action-oriented text. PERU highlighted lack of funds  for vulnerability and adaptation assessments, and difficulties in  proving global benefits of adaptation projects for accessing GEF  funds. MICRONESIA, for AOSIS, emphasized data collection, and  technologies for adaptation. Delegates discussed the Special  Climate Change Fund, and the frequency and format of feedback from  the GEF on activities undertaken in response to decision 5/CP.7,  including efforts to address or mainstream adaptation within  climate change and other GEF focal areas. Discussions continued  late into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With completion of negotiations on the draft conclusions on  technology transfer, participants' applause appeared far from  reality in other contact groups meetings on Tuesday. Traditionally  challenging issues continued to be so, including in one group  where entire sections of the Marrakesh Accords were copied, to  avoid repetition of old controversies. In another, an offer of  coffee for participants foresaw that negotiations would continue  late into the night.
