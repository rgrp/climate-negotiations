# PLENARY

COP-5 met in Plenary to consider proposed amendments to FCCC  Annexes I and II. Turkey's proposal to be removed from the Annexes  was supported by PAKISTAN, the US, MEXICO and GEORGIA. The  MARSHALL ISLANDS expressed concern about the precedent it would  set.

Several Annex I Parties welcomed Kazakhstan's proposal to be  included in Annex I. Several non-Annex I Parties said further  information was needed on Kazakhstan's ability to fulfill Annex I  commitments. AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION said no  information requirements were placed on initial members of Annex  I. KAZAKHSTAN expressed willingness to provide the required  information. SUDAN called for guidelines on amending the Annexes.  INDIA, with CHINA and IRAN, recommended the use of Article 4.2 (g)  (provision for non-Annex I Parties to bind themselves to  commitments in 4.2 (a) and (b)). The President will conduct  informal consultations on both issues.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

On GHG inventory data for Annex I  communications, the US, with POLAND, stressed that timeliness and  completeness of submissions were critical in providing a basis for  COP action. The EU noted that its future national systems would  fulfill quality and time requirements, and expressed concern about  the continuous increase in GHG emissions since 1997.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

On the date and venue  of COP-6, the G-77/CHINA proposed holding it in November 2000 and  expressed concern over the proliferation of intersessional  activities and workshops, their budgetary implications and  obstacles for developing country participation. In view of the  workload to meet the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA), the US,  with CANADA, AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, said COP-6 should be held  early in 2001 with various intersessional activities on the run- up. CHINA said the BAPA only calls for 'demonstrable progress' by  COP-6. The EU and others emphasized the need for sufficient  progress to allow early entry into force of the Protocol. To  maintain political momentum, JAPAN noted its preference for COP-6  in November 2000. SWITZERLAND said timing of COP-6 should result  from progress on pending issues and highlighted the need for a  work-plan.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

On income and budget  performance in the biennium 1998-1999 and arrangements for  administrative support to the FCCC, the EU proposed an open-ended  group to clarify some issues. The G-77/CHINA called for informal  consultations by Chair Ashe. The US expressed hope for the  resolution of pending issues on non-Annex I communications to  ensure budgetary resources on this topic.

On implementation of the Headquarters Agreement the Executive  Secretary noted the need for more office space to host the growing  Secretariat.

# SBSTA

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates expressed appreciation of the  African regional workshop organized as part of the consultative  process. The IPCC outlined the Special Report on technology  transfer and said actions to enhance technology transfer are  specific to sectors, national circumstances and stakeholders.

Several Parties said the private sector should drive technology  transfer. AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the potential  role of the clean development mechanism (CDM) in technology  transfer. The PHILIPPINES, with SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA, stressed  that technology transfer was a commitment under the FCCC and  opposed linking it to the CDM. CHINA said technology transfer  under the Protocol should be additional to that under the FCCC.  The PHILIPPINES called for information on technology transfer  activities in Annex-I communications. AOSIS stressed addressing  adaptation technologies. The G-77/CHINA called for a COP-5  decision on capacity building. SWITZERLAND underscored  consideration of specific national circumstances. The REPUBLIC OF  KOREA noted the need to review the transfer of public-funded  technology in the consultative process. The CLIMATE TECHNOLOGY  INITIATIVE provided an overview of its ventures as a multilateral  facilitator of technology diffusion. A draft decision will be  prepared.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Regarding 'best practices' in policies and  measures (P&Ms), Chair Dovland announced that Denmark will host a  workshop in April 2000. The EU said the upcoming workshop should  consider, inter alia, defining 'best practices' and assessing the  extent to which international cooperation may enhance  effectiveness of P&Ms. AUSTRALIA preferred reference to 'good'  rather than 'best' practices and, with JAPAN and the US, said P&Ms  should reflect national circumstances. SAUDI ARABIA said the  workshop should also address 'wrong' practices.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

On emissions resulting from fuel used for  international transportation, delegates considered the  International Maritime Organization's report on its activities to  prevent air pollution from ships.  The International Civil  Aviation Organization reported on the progress made in developing  an Action Plan on aircraft engine emissions and in evaluating  market-based options in limiting bunker emissions.

On allocation of international bunker emissions, the CLIMATE  ACTION NETWORK advocated their inclusion in national inventories.  The EU recommended completing the work on including international  bunker emissions in national inventories before negotiating the  second commitment period. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, supported by  AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, said it was premature to discuss  allocation due to the difficulties in differentiating emissions  resulting from national and international fuel.

The US highlighted the need for guidance on definitions and  clarity. NEW ZEALAND, with the EU and the US, stressed improving  reporting of bunker emissions for consistency and comparability.  Jose Romero (Switzerland) will conduct informal consultations on  this issue.

On the impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment  period, ICELAND said single projects have a greater proportional  impact on emissions in smaller countries, affecting their ability  to meet emissions targets. He called for a conclusive decision on  this issue at COP-6. CANADA expressed reservations on the issue  and opposed the draft decision tabled by Iceland at COP-4 in its  current form. Informal consultations will be conducted by Ole  Plougmann (Denmark) to forward conclusions or a draft decision to  SBSTA.

Regarding the scientific and methodological aspects of the  proposal from Brazil , several delegates supported the concept of  differentiated responsibilities, while a number noted that further  scientific analysis would be useful. The EU and PERU, opposed by  MALAYSIA, said the issue should be considered as part of IPCC's  Third Assessment Report. Chair Dovland said he would prepare draft  conclusions on this issue, following informal consultations.

On other matters, SBSTA decided to exclude consideration of  harvested wood products. However, Parties were asked to submit  their views to the Secretariat. On information on decision tools  to evaluate climate change impacts and adaptation strategies, the  Secretariat requested submissions from Parties.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The  Secretariat outlined its efforts on an inter-agency project  proposal for capacity building under the CDM. The PHILIPPINES and  CHINA recommended consideration of the G-77/China capacity- building draft decision. UGANDA proposed a permanent clearing- house to streamline funding. The EU stressed the need for  continuous cooperation.

On cooperation with other Conventions, SBSTA heard reports from  UNEP, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the  Convention on Wetlands on synergies between the FCCC and other  conventions.

SBSTA continued its deliberations late into the evening on agenda  items on: ways and means of limiting emissions of  hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons; coastal adaptation  technologies; and research and systematic observation.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

The contact group on implementation of FCCC  Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and matters relating to Protocol Article 3.14   (adverse effects) discussed the recent workshop held in Bonn.  Several delegates called for analysis on the effects of response  measures for all developing countries, not only oil producing  countries. Delegates were invited to submit written proposals on  possible actions to be synthesized by the co-chairs.

### AIJ

A contact group on the AIJ and its pilot phase raised a  number of issues, including: whether to continue the review beyond  this session; if the pilot phase should continue and, if so, in  what form; whether the group should take decisions or make  recommendations about the eligibility of AIJ to become CDM or JI;  and if the issue of eligibility should be discussed by the contact  group on mechanisms. Some delegates stressed the need to discuss  AIJ's prospects, noting the need for incentives to maintain the  momentum.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

The contact group on capacity building  discussed procedural issues. The G-77/CHINA said its draft  decision should serve as the basis for a recommendation to COP-5,  since it presents a comprehensive approach to all capacity  building activities and specifies developing countries' needs in  its annex. Other delegates said COP-5 should establish a process  leading to a substantive decision at COP-6. They said more work  was needed on assessing specific national needs. A co-chairs' text  will be prepared based on Parties' written submissions.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group continued consideration  of the second part of a revised draft text on guidelines for Annex  I communications. Patricipants discussed P&Ms, projections of the  total effect of P&Ms, and exchanged initial views on financial  resources. Delegates agreed on a number of paragraphs. They  invited the Chair to settle the terminology of projections  'without measures,' since these were unusual terms compared to  'business as usual,' and misleading, as they seemed to exclude  consideration of P&Ms implemented prior to the starting point of  the projection. They also deferred consideration of the  information to be included in the description of each P&Ms to a  smaller group.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

The Chair distributed a draft text  compiling the EU and G-77/CHINA proposals on non-Annex I  communications. The group decided to devote its time to a  question-and-answer session with the GEF and its implementing  agencies. Participants discussed inter alia: GEF's interpretation  of 'agreed full costs,' the non-duplication principle endorsed by  the GEF Council, the terms of agreement between the implementing  agency and the recipient country, including terms for the  disbursement of funds, GEF funding for adaptation measures and  FCCC COP guidance to the GEF.

### LULUCF

The contact group, co-chaired by Halldor Thorgeirsson  (Iceland) and Philip Gwage (Uganda), expressed diverging views on  timing for consideration of the need for country-specific data and  information and its relationship to a decision-making framework in  the context of the Protocol. There was general agreement on the  consideration of the IPCC Special Report at SBSTA-12. The group  also agreed to initiate an exchange views on a decision-making  framework and on data requirements.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While some observers were suspicious that Kazakhstan's proposal to  add itself to Annex I could create a new source of 'hot air,'  others welcomed the move as a first step toward expanding the  number of countries with limitation and reduction commitments.  Several participants also felt that systemic inadequacies in the  climate regime made it extremely difficult to deal with requests  for addition or deletion from the Annexes in a principled manner.
