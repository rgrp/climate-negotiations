abstract: "The twenty-second sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB 22) of the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  took place from 19-27 May 2005, at the Maritim Hotel in Bonn,  Germany. The sessions were attended by almost 1600 participants  representing 156 Parties to the Convention, one observer State,  and numerous UN agencies, intergovernmental organizations and  non-governmental organizations (NGOs)."
---

SB 22 was the first gathering of the Subsidiary Bodies since the  entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005. It was  also the final preparatory session prior to the first Conference  of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (COP/MOP 1), which will take place from 28 November to  9 December 2005, in Montreal, Canada.

At SB 22, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological  Advice (SBSTA) addressed issues relating to adaptation,  mitigation, the development and transfer of technologies, and  policies and measures among Annex I Parties. They also concluded  their work on a range of other issues, including research needs  relating to the UNFCCC, cooperation with relevant international  organizations, implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse  effects of policies and measures), and methodological matters.

The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) considered  arrangements for COP/MOP 1 and the eleventh Conference of the  Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 11). SBI also addressed various  administrative and financial matters, eventually agreeing on the  programme budget for 2006-2007 at a level that was US$1.75 million  less than had been proposed. After extensive discussions,  delegates also resolved two longstanding issues on SBI's agenda,  on the Least Developed Countries, and on national communications  from non-Annex I Parties. However, they were unable to conclude  their work on the Special Climate Change Fund, which will be taken  up again at SB 23.

On a number of fronts, SB 22 was buoyed by the momentum created by  entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol earlier this year, which  also carried over into the pre-sessional Seminar of Governmental  Experts (SOGE). However, there were also signs of the jockeying  and positioning that will happen at COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 in  Montreal, given that the process is about to enter new and  uncharted waters.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats  to sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on the  environment, human health, food security, economic activity,  natural resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate  varies naturally but scientists agree that rising concentrations  of anthropogenically produced greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and scientific findings  indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 189 Parties. The Parties to the UNFCCC typically convene once  a year in a Conference of the Parties (COP), and twice a year in  meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In December 1997, delegates at COP 3 in Kyoto,  Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  (EITs) to achieve quantified emissions reduction targets. These  countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to  reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an  average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first  commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to  country. The Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms  to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets  cost-effectively: an emissions trading system; joint implementation  (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and  the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows for projects  to be implemented in non-Annex I Parties. Following COP 3, Parties  initiated negotiations on most of the rules and operational  details determining how countries will reduce emissions, and  measure and assess emissions reductions. To date, 150 Parties have  ratified the Protocol, including 37 Annex I Parties, representing  61.6% of 1990 Annex I greenhouse gas emissions, meeting the  requirements for entry into force of the Protocol, which took  place on 16 February 2005.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

The Buenos Aires Plan of Action  (BAPA) was negotiated at COP 4 in 1998, to set out a process for  taking forward the provisions of the Protocol. The BAPA set COP 6  as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational details  of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC.  Protocol issues to be addressed included rules relating to the  flexible mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties' compliance,  accounting methods for national emissions and emissions  reductions, and rules on crediting countries for carbon sinks.  Issues under the UNFCCC that required resolution included  questions of capacity building, the development and transfer of  technology, and assistance to those developing countries  particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change  or to actions taken by industrialized countries to combat climate  change.

Following agreement on the BAPA at COP 4, subsequent meetings  attempted to reach agreement on the various elements of the work  programme. In November 2000, Parties met at COP 6 in The Hague,  the Netherlands, and attempted to complete these negotiations,  without success. COP 6 was thus suspended until July 2001 when it  reconvened in Bonn, Germany. Delegates held protracted  consultations, and finally agreed to adopt a political decision,  the Bonn Agreements. However, this political decision could only  be operationalized as part of a package of COP decisions on issues  such as the flexible mechanisms, compliance and land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF). As delegates were unable to finalize  text on every decision, they agreed to forward all the draft  decisions to COP 7 for final resolution.

### THE MARRAKESH ACCORDS

Delegates continued discussions on the Bonn  Agreements at COP 7 in October/November 2001. Following extensive  negotiations, the Marrakesh Accords were adopted and have served  as the basis for subsequent negotiations. The Marrakesh Accords  set out building blocks for decisions under the Protocol and  UNFCCC, including: the flexible mechanisms; LULUCF; rules for  compliance; rules on communicating and reviewing information on  emissions and removals of greenhouse gases; and issues relating to  support for developing countries, including capacity building,  technology transfer, responding to the adverse effects of climate  change, and the establishment of three funds - the Least Developed  Countries (LDC) Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and  the Adaptation Fund.

### COP 8 AND COP 9

Delegates met at COP 8 in October/November 2002,  and again at COP 9 in December 2003, to negotiate decisions for  implementing the Marrakesh Accords. Among other things, Parties  agreed on rules and procedures for the CDM Executive Board (EB),  the body designated to supervise the CDM, and modalities and  procedures for afforestation and reforestation (A&R) activities  under the CDM. Parties also discussed how to integrate findings of  the IPCC's Third Assessment Report into the work of the UNFCCC,  agreeing on two new agenda items on adaptation and on mitigation.

### SB 20

In June 2004, delegates met in Bonn at the twentieth  sessions of SBI and SBSTA. Among other things, SBSTA 20 considered  small-scale A&R CDM project activities and good practice guidance  on LULUCF, and held two in-session workshops on adaptation, and on  mitigation. SBI 20 addressed the UNFCCC's financial mechanism and  arrangements for intergovernmental meetings.

### COP 10

COP 10 was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 6-18  December 2004. The meeting involved lengthy negotiations on how to  engage on commitments to combat climate change in the post-2012  period. The Kyoto Protocol requires Parties to begin considering  the post-2012 period by 2005. Delegates eventually agreed to hold  a Seminar of Governmental Experts prior to SB 22 in May 2005.  However, the terms of reference for the Seminar did not refer to  the post-2012 period or new commitments. Rather, they stated that  the purpose of the Seminar was to promote 'an informal exchange of  information on: (a) actions relating to mitigation and adaptation  to assist Parties to continue to develop effective and appropriate  responses to climate change; and (b) policies and measures adopted  by their respective governments that support implementation of  their existing commitments under the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.' Delegates also agreed on a package on adaptation - the Buenos  Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures - that  supports further implementation of measures to adapt to the  adverse effects of climate change, while also addressing calls for  economic diversification for countries affected by the global  community's response measures to deal with climate change.

In addition, Parties addressed and adopted numerous decisions and  conclusions on issues such as technology transfer, LULUCF, the  UNFCCC's financial mechanism, and education, training and public  awareness. Some issues remained unresolved. These included  negotiations on the LDC Fund, the SCCF, submission of national  communications from non-Annex I Parties, and Protocol Article 2.3  (adverse effects of policies and measures).

### UNFCCC SEMINAR OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS

The Seminar of  Governmental Experts (SOGE) was held from 16-17 May 2005, in Bonn.  While the Seminar had no formal outcome, delegates addressed some  of the broader issues facing the climate change process. Foremost  among these for some Parties was the question of a future  framework and commitments beyond 2012. There were also exchanges  of information, experiences and opinions on how to respond to the  increasingly strong evidence of climate change, address the  differences of opinion over the Kyoto Protocol and move forward in  putting mitigation and adaptation measures into action. For more  information, see the Earth Negotiations Bulletin's summary of the  meeting: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12261e.html.

# SB 22 REPORT

During SB 22, the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological  Advice (SBSTA) convened five times in plenary, as well as in a  number of contact groups and informal consultations, to make  progress on the items on its agenda. As a result of these  meetings, draft conclusions were adopted on a number of issues and  draft decisions were forwarded to COP 11 or COP/MOP 1 for their  consideration. The conclusions and draft decisions addressed  scientific, technical and socioeconomic impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, as well as  climate change mitigation, the development and transfer of  technologies, and 'good practices' in policies and measures (P&Ms)  among Annex I Parties. They also dealt with research needs  relating to the Convention, cooperation with relevant  international organizations, methodological issues and various  other matters. The methodological issues included technical  guidance on methodologies for adjustments under the Kyoto  Protocol, registry systems under the Protocol, and the  implications of implementing project activities under the CDM for  achieving the objectives of other environmental treaties. SBSTA  was not able to complete its work on emissions from fuel used for  international aviation and maritime transport. Parties were also  unable to adopt conclusions on the International Meeting to Review  the Implementation of the Programme of Action for Small Island  Developing States (SIDS), which took place from 10-14 January  2005, in Port Louis, Mauritius.

The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) considered  arrangements for intergovernmental meetings, including COP/MOP 1  and COP 11, as well as future sessional periods and organization  of the intergovernmental process. It also addressed various  administrative and financial matters, issues relating to the least  developed countries (LDCs) and to national communications from  non-Annex I Parties. The SBI was unable to conclude its work on  the SCCF, which will be taken up again at SB 23.

In addition to the formal Subsidiary Bodies' meetings and  consultations, over 40 side events were held. For more information  on side events, visit: http://www.iisd.ca/climate/sb22/enbots.

This report on SB 22 is based on the agenda of the sessions, with  separate sections on matters taken up by SBSTA and SBI.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

SBSTA 22 opened on Thursday morning, 19 May 2005. UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter welcomed delegates and conveyed the  regrets of SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Salem Benrageb (Libya) that he  was unable to attend the start of the session. She thanked SBSTA  Vice-Chair Amjad Abdulla (Maldives) for taking up the task of  chairing the meeting until Chair Benrageb arrived later in the  session. She observed that SBSTA had a heavy agenda that would  contribute to COP 11 and COP/MOP 1.

Luxembourg, on behalf of the European Union (EU), urged delegates  to build on the positive experience of the SOGE, and supported  setting in motion procedures on the post-2012 period. On the SBSTA  agenda, he emphasized the item on mitigation, and welcomed  discussions on adaptation, and on aviation and maritime transport.

Jamaica, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China),  stressed international action on climate change and its linkages  with the Millennium Development Goals. She also highlighted issues  of adaptation, mitigation and methodological issues. Kenya, for  the Africa Group, pressed for simplified CDM modalities and urgent  action on technology transfer and adaptation. Tuvalu, on behalf of  the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), highlighted  adaptation and the needs of SIDS. Egypt called for increased  efforts on mitigation. Mali highlighted the impacts of climate  change on LDCs.

SBSTA Vice-Chair Abdulla introduced the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/1).  Saudi Arabia, supported by Qatar, stated that COP decision 10/CP.9  on adaptation should also be reflected in the agenda of the SBI,  and suggested deferring adoption of the SBSTA agenda until the SBI  matter was resolved. The EU, G-77/China, Africa Group, Norway,  Japan, South Africa, New Zealand, Kenya, Tanzania and others  supported adopting the SBSTA agenda. Vice-Chair Abdulla took note  of Saudi Arabia's concerns, and the agenda was adopted. SBSTA also  approved Vice-Chair Abdulla's updated proposal for the session's  organization of work.

# ADAPTATION

The scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of,  and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, were first  taken up by SBSTA 22 on Thursday, 19 May. The aim of discussions  on this item was to develop a five-year SBSTA work programme on  adaptation, as mandated by decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires  Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures). After an  in-session workshop, numerous informal consultations and six  contact group meetings, delegates agreed to SBSTA conclusions,  which included a draft COP decision and draft annex on the SBSTA  programme. However, as this was the first session where the work  programme was formally discussed, SBSTA did not finalize the  programme, and the draft decision and annex remain bracketed.  Parties did agree, though, that the first step in the process  should be to conduct a comprehensive stock taking exercise.

To facilitate the development of this work programme, SBSTA  organized an in-session workshop, which was held on Saturday, 21  May. The workshop was co-chaired by Philip Gwage (Uganda) and  David Warrilow (UK), and consisted of a key note presentation by  Ian Burton, University of Toronto, and presentations by fifteen  country representatives. Common themes among the presenters  included the need for information sharing and international  cooperation, bottom-up approaches, engaging both practitioners and  policy makers, and integration into sustainable development. A  summary of these discussions is available online at:  http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12265e.html.

SBSTA then reconvened on Monday, 23 May, to take up the item and  hear a summary of the workshop. A contact group, co-chaired by  Marjorie Pyoos (South Africa) and James Shevlin (Australia), was  set up to continue consultations.

Basing their discussion on the SBSTA Vice-Chair's summary of the  workshop, which contained possible elements of the programme of  work, deliberations in the contact group centered on the  objectives of the programme and on possible approaches. Delegates  engaged in an initial exchange of views, in which the G-77/China  and AOSIS reiterated their call for action-oriented measures and  said that the need to expedite these should not be restricted by  calls for further assessments. The EU, the US and New Zealand  favored improved understanding and cooperation. The G-77/China and  AOSIS also called for reference to the most vulnerable, with AOSIS  calling for a special track for SIDS to address urgent needs.  Saudi Arabia underscored adaptation to response measures.

On the structure of the work programme, the US highlighted the  need to focus on priority sectors. The G-77/China proposed instead  using a variety of integrated approaches that would proceed in  parallel and not sequentially. This included a livelihoods  approach that focuses on assets ('capitals') as opposed to a  sectoral approach. The Africa Group warned that a sectoral  approach could marginalize local knowledge. Japan also preferred  taking a broad thematic approach to avoid time-consuming  discussions on priority sectors. The G-77/China and AOSIS called  for establishing an experts' working group to advance work and  ensure follow-up.

Debate on the draft conclusions and decision focused on whether to  make reference to decision 1/CP.10, as proposed by the G-77/China,  or to the subsection under decision 1/CP.10 that refers  specifically to SBSTA and to the work programme. Saudi Arabia,  opposed by the EU, Switzerland, Norway and others, said that  referring to the whole decision covers the interests of all  Parties. On Thursday, 26 May, SBSTA Chair Benrageb offered to  conduct an informal workshop before SB 23 to facilitate the  development of the work programme, and, following minor editorial  amendments, delegates agreed to the draft conclusions, which were  adopted by SBSTA in plenary on 27 May.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and Draft COP Decision

In the conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.14), SBSTA takes note of submissions from  Parties and welcomes the exchange of views during the in-session  workshop. SBSTA also agrees to further consider and elaborate the  draft annex and draft COP decision at SB 23, and requests the  Secretariat, under the guidance of the SBSTA Chair, to organize an  informal workshop before SB 23 to facilitate the development of  the programme of work. The draft COP decision remains bracketed.

# MITIGATION

The agenda item on the scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of mitigation of climate change was first addressed in a  morning in-session SBSTA workshop, and in an afternoon SBSTA  plenary both held on Monday, 23 May. A contact group co-chaired by  Kok Seng Yap (Malaysia) and Toshiyuki Sakamoto (Japan) was  convened. It met twice formally, and a number of informal  consultations were also held. SBSTA later adopted a conclusion  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.10) on the issue.

During the in-session workshop, delegates heard presentations from  international experts focusing on factors that affect mitigation  technology innovation, deployment, and diffusion, and  socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, including poverty reduction  and economic impacts. Experts addressed, inter alia, capital  structures of the energy sector, greening investment, energy  efficiency, public investment in R&D, market barriers, links  between mitigation and local pollution abatement, spillover  effects, and the CDM. A summary of these discussions is available  online at: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12266e.html Subsequent contact group deliberations were based on draft  conclusions prepared by the contact group Co-Chairs. Discussions  focused on two main areas: reporting by the Secretariat on lessons  learned from previous mitigation workshops; and the holding of a  pre-sessional workshop on mitigation at SBSTA 23.

On reporting by the Secretariat, discussions centered on format,  scope of the reporting and the calendar, with agreement quickly  reached on Wednesday, 25 May. Parties agreed on the timing of  reporting and that the reports should be 'concise.' On the pre-sessional workshop, the EU and Canada were in favor of  holding a forum where Parties could exchange their views on  lessons learned from mitigation workshops and future steps to take  under this agenda item. The G-77/China, the US, Japan and  Australia doubted the value of such a forum, and also expressed  concerns about funding requirements, and the effects on the time  available to consider other agenda items. The EU, with Canada,  proposed a pre-sessional workshop, as it would be more cost  efficient and would not interfere with other agenda items. The US  voiced concern that a pre-sessional workshop would be simply an  extension of negotiations. After three days of discussions, there  was no agreement on having such a forum, and references were  dropped from the draft conclusions.

Another issue raised in the contact group was carbon capture and  storage. Canada noted the upcoming IPCC special report on the  issue, and suggested that carbon capture and storage should be  considered before COP/MOP 2. The US said he was not clear that the  IPCC report on this issue belonged on this agenda item.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.10),  SBSTA takes note of the submissions from Parties contained in  document FCCC/SBSTA/2005/MISC.2 and Adds.1-2. It also welcomes the  exchange of views in the in-session workshop held at SBSTA 22, and  the SBSTA Chair's summary of the workshop. Further, the SBSTA  requests the Secretariat to prepare, by 15 July 2005, a concise  report on the topics presented at the in-session workshops held to  date, covering greenhouse gases, sectors, technologies, regions  and socioeconomic aspects and other related factors addressed.

# METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

SBSTA 22 took up a range of methodological issues, including  emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime  transport, technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments  under the Protocol, and registry systems under the Protocol. SBSTA  also addressed the implications of implementing project activities  under the CDM for achieving the objectives of other environmental  treaties. Parties were able to adopt conclusions on all of these  issues, with the exception of the sub-item on emissions from  aviation and maritime transport.

### EMISSIONS FROM FUEL USED FOR INTERNATIONAL AVIATION AND MARITIME  TRANSPORT

This issue was taken up at SBSTA 22 in plenary on  Thursday, 19 May, when the UNFCCC Secretariat introduced an  updated note (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.2) on the topic. The  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) summarized its  work in this area, and several Parties underscored the importance  of the issue. The matter was then taken up in informal  consultations, with Parties working on draft conclusions. The  consultations were facilitated by José Romero (Switzerland).

In the contact group, differences among Parties soon emerged,  particularly over a possible follow-up process. While the EU  sought to set out a process that might include a workshop or other  experts' event, some other Parties, including the US, questioned  the need for a workshop. After lengthy negotiations, text emerged  that took note of information provided by ICAO and invited the  International Maritime Organization (IMO) to provide information  on its current and planned activities relating to maritime  transport emissions at SBSTA 24 in May 2006. The text also  included a compromise between the EU, US and others that  recognized the methodological difficulties and limited  availability of data for distinguishing between domestic and  international fuel consumption. The compromise also requested an  intersessional workshop, subject to availability of resources, in  early 2007, to discuss inventory issues, including improving the  quality of reporting on emissions estimates for aviation and  maritime transport. The text agreed that SBSTA would not take up  the issue again until May 2007.

While the compromise text was agreeable to most Parties, Saudi  Arabia, Kuwait and a number of other oil-exporting developing  countries objected to text outlining such a follow-up process.  These countries argued that discussing emissions from aviation and  maritime transport was diverting SBSTA's limited time and  attention away from other issues that are more important to  developing countries.

In the closing SBSTA plenary on Friday, 27 May, the compromise  text was supported by the EU, US, Canada, Australia, Russian  Federation, Argentina, Bulgaria, New Zealand, Ukraine, Japan,  Norway, AOSIS and the Environmental Integrity Group (Switzerland,  Republic of Korea and Mexico). However, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,  United Arab Emirates, Oman, Iran and Libya were not in support of  the text. India also opposed a paragraph on holding a workshop,  highlighting budget cuts for the UNFCCC and ongoing work on this  issue by ICAO.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

With no agreement reached, SBSTA adopted brief  revised conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.11/Rev.1), noting that  SBSTA 22 did not complete its consideration of this issue, and  will resume discussions at SBSTA 23.

### IMPLICATIONS OF PROJECT ACTIVITIES UNDER THE CDM FOR ACHIEVING THE  AIMS OF OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES

This issue was first  addressed in SBSTA plenary on Thursday, 19 May, and in two contact  group meetings on Friday, 20 May, and Tuesday, 24 May. The agenda  item was the result of a request by the COP to develop a  recommendation for COP/MOP 1 on the implications for other  environmental instruments, particularly the Montreal Protocol,  arising from the establishment of new hydrochlorofluorocarbon-22  (HCFC-22) facilities to earn credits under the CDM for the  destruction of hydrofluorocarbon-23 (HFC-23).

During contact group consultations, chaired by Georg Børsting  (Norway), Parties agreed to request the Secretariat to prepare an  options paper based on submissions by Parties and with input from  the CDM EB, in order to make a decision on this issue at  COP/MOP 1. Discussions then centered on whether to also invite the  views of relevant intergovernmental organizations and of Parties,  and on how to incorporate Parties' submissions into the options  paper. Parties eventually agreed that the options paper should be  specifically based on implications for the Montreal Protocol of  the establishment of HCFC-22 facilities for gaining credits from  HFC-23 destruction under the CDM, and on means to address such  implications.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.3), SBSTA  takes note of the information contained in a technical paper  prepared by the Secretariat on this issue. SBSTA also invites  Parties and admitted observers and relevant intergovernmental  organizations to submit to the Secretariat, by 5 August 2005,  their inputs on the implications for the achievement of the  objective of the Montreal Protocol of the establishment of new  HCFC-22 facilities to obtain credits for HFC-23 burning, and on  the means to address such implications. SBSTA further requests the  Secretariat to compile the submissions and prepare an options  paper based on Parties' submissions and inputs by the CDM EB for  consideration by SB 23, with a view to preparing a draft COP/MOP 1  decision on this matter.

### TECHNICAL GUIDANCE ON METHODOLOGIES FOR ADJUSTMENTS UNDER THE  KYOTO PROTOCOL

This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in plenary  on Thursday, 19 May, and subsequently in four contact group  meetings and in during informal consultations. In these meetings,  Parties considered a note prepared by the Secretariat containing a  proposal for technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments  for LULUCF activities (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/2). This proposal was  prepared building on the technical guidance already approved by  COP 9 for non-LULUCF activities. The discussions, co-chaired by  Newton Paciornik (Brazil) and Audun Rosland (Norway), were not  contentious, and involved a technical review of the procedures and  methods for use by expert review teams to calculate adjustments,  including tables of 'conservativeness factors.' Delegates agreed  to the tables and the technical guidance with minor amendments.  The exception was criteria for case of failure to submit  information on these activities. For these, delegates agreed to  request submissions by Parties with a view to continuing their  consideration at SB 24.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and Draft COP and COP/MOP Decisions

In its  conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.2), SBSTA notes that it has  considered the technical paper prepared by the Secretariat, and  recommends a draft COP decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.2/Add.1), which  includes a draft COP/MOP decision and an annex containing the  technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under LULUCF.  It requests the Secretariat to establish a process to allow expert  review teams to gain experience with adjustments for LULUCF during  the inventory review process in 2007-2008, using real inventory  data voluntarily submitted by Parties, and to arrange an  information event with lead reviewers, other review experts, and  Parties to share experiences at SB 24. A similar event will take  place again at SB 28, dealing with experiences on adjustments for  sinks. SBSTA further invites Parties to submit, by 19 August 2005,  proposals for developing criteria for cases of failure to submit  information relating to estimates of emissions and removals by  sinks. This latter question will be taken up by SBSTA 23 in order  to recommend a decision for adoption by COP/MOP 1.

### REGISTRY SYSTEMS UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

This item was first  taken up on Thursday, 19 May, in SBSTA's opening plenary, when  Murray Ward (New Zealand) presented the results of informal  consultations held before SB 22. He announced that the  international transaction log (ITL) would not be operative before  the second half of 2006, noted that CDM projects cannot  participate in the EU carbon market until the ITL is operational,  and underscored the Secretariat's funding needs.

Informal consultations were successful, and in the SBSTA closing  plenary on Friday, 27 May, Murray Ward announced that details are  in place for the Secretariat to test the ITL, which is thus  expected to be ready by the third quarter of 2006.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.7), SBSTA  takes note of the report on intersessional consultations on  registry systems. SBSTA also commends the work of the Secretariat  in identifying checks to be performed by the ITL as contained in  document FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.3, considers that the checks provide  a good foundation on which to continue the development of the ITL,  and encourages Parties to make full use of the document. In  addition, SBSTA: welcomes the information that recent  contributions by Parties to the Trust Fund for Supplementary  Activities allow the Secretariat to proceed with the development  of ITL; notes that the Secretariat expects the ITL to be ready for  the initialization of communications by other registry systems in  the third quarter of 2006; and notes that the ITL administrator  will prepare common operational procedures.

# DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

The development and transfer of technologies was first addressed  at SBSTA 22 in plenary on Thursday, 19 May. A contact group  co-chaired by William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Holger  Liptow (Germany) was convened. The group met twice formally, and  numerous times informally, to agree on draft conclusions, which  include terms of reference for the Expert Group on Technology  Transfer (EGTT). These conclusions were adopted by SBSTA 22.

During the SBSTA plenary, EGTT Chair Kishan Kummarsingh (Trinidad  and Tobago) presented the EGTT's most recent report. Malaysia, for  the G-77/China, underscored the importance of meeting the needs  identified in the technological needs assessments (TNAs), and  asked for a full review of implementation of COP decisions related  to technology transfer since COP 1. The Umbrella Group (a group of  developed countries, including the US, Canada, Japan, Australia,  New Zealand, Norway and Iceland) stressed private sector  involvement and creating an enabling environment.

During contact group meetings and informal discussions, delegates  deliberated on draft text prepared by the Co-Chairs. Discussions  were generally divided along north-south lines, with Parties  focused on a broad range of issues, including: whether SBSTA  should 'request' or 'recommend' tasks to EGTT under its terms of  reference; the review of COP decisions since COP 1; the assessment  of the implementation framework; the involvement of the private  sector; long term strategies; and the consideration of specific  technologies.

On the review of COP decisions, the G-77/China supported reviewing  all COP decisions, while the EU, the US, Japan, and others said  that the framework for implementation was the starting point,  since it already considered previous decisions.

On involvement of the private sector, discussion focused on who  should facilitate private sector involvement and provide enabling  environments.

Discussion also focused on whether there should be a long-term  strategy for technology transfer or a long-term strategy  specifically for the EGTT's programme of work.

Regarding consideration of specific technologies, the G-77/China  wanted a listing of specific technologies to be considered by the  EGTT, while the US, EU, Japan and others said that SBSTA should  not 'pick winners.' Compromise text was agreed for all issues.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.13),  SBSTA agrees on terms of reference to guide the EGTT in preparing  recommendations for enhancing the implementation of the framework  for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation  of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology transfer). The SBSTA welcomes  the report of the EGTT Chair and collaboration between UNEP and  UNDP on the analysis of the TNAs. The SBSTA takes note the  workshop for innovative financing of development and transfer of  technologies, planned for October 2005, and that the EGTT will  explore further the issue of public domain and publicly owned  technologies. It also notes the adaptation technologies seminar to  be held in Trinidad and Tobago from 14-16 June 2005. The SBSTA  further notes the heavy workload of the EGTT and Secretariat,  invites Parties to provide financial support and encourages the  EGTT to continue to consider issues relating to diffusion and  transfer of advanced, cleaner and more efficient, affordable and  cost-effective energy technologies, taking into account the  outcomes of the TNAs.

In its terms of reference, the EGTT is requested to, inter alia:review the progress made and effectiveness in the  implementation of activities identified under each key theme of  the framework; suggest ways and means to advance the implementation of the  framework; identify practical actions and concrete steps for the  involvement of the private sector; consider how to enhance cooperation with relevant conventions  and intergovernmental processes; consider medium- and long-term  strategies and planning of work; consider how to promote collaborative research; and recommend possible revision of key themes in the existing  framework.

# POLICIES AND MEASURES

The agenda item on 'good practices' in P&Ms among Annex I Parties  was first addressed by SBSTA in plenary on Thursday, 19 May.  Informal consultations, facilitated by Tony Surridge (South  Africa) and Normand Tremblay (Canada), were convened. A  round-table on the issue, mandated by SBSTA 20, was held on  Tuesday, 24 May. The event involved presentations and  discussions aimed at sharing information and exchanging  experiences in implementing P&Ms, and was divided into three  parts: domestic aspects, international aspects, and  cross-cutting issues. A summary of these discussions is  available online at: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12266e.html.

During informal consultations, delegates reacted positively to the  round table, and were able to agree on a short text outlining  draft conclusions. The conclusions were agreed and forwarded to  SBSTA, which adopted them.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.4), SBSTA  notes that it has considered document FCCC/SBSTA/2004/INF.10  containing options for using web-based approaches for sharing  information and experiences on 'good practices' among Annex I  Parties. SBSTA also welcomes the round-table discussion, recalls  the upcoming Secretariat report on 'good practices' and agrees to  consider next steps at SBSTA 24.

# RESEARCH NEEDS RELATING TO THE CONVENTION

This issue was first addressed in SBSTA plenary on Thursday, 19  May, and then in two contact group meetings co-chaired by María  Paz Cigarán (Peru) and Sergio Castellari (Italy). The conclusions  aim to establish a dialogue between SBSTA and research programmes  and institutions at the national, regional and international level.

Discussions in the plenary focused on two main themes: the need to  increase the capacity of developing countries to contribute to  climate change efforts, including greater involvement from experts  from developing countries; and whether or not SBSTA should provide  direction to the IPCC on research. Switzerland and Australia noted  the need to avoid duplication of IPCC efforts. The EU, opposed by  Kenya, proposed a draft study to identify key policy-relevant  research issues to be communicated to the research community.

###     SBSTA Conclusions and Draft COP Decision

In the conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.6), SBSTA welcomes the efforts of national,  regional and international global change research programmes, and  the endorsement of the 10-year Implementation Plan at the third  Earth Observation Summit, which established the Global Earth  Observation System of Systems. SBSTA also: invites submissions by  Parties on research needs and priorities; requests the Secretariat  to prepare a synthesis report of research needs and to make it  available to Parties and relevant regional and international  climate change research programmes before SB 24; requests the  Secretariat to organize a side event at SB 24 to enhance  communication between climate change research organizations and  SBSTA; stresses the need to enhance the research capacity of  developing countries; and notes that improved understanding of  climate change can inform the development of technologies for  mitigation and adaptation.

In the draft COP decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.6/Add.1), the COP,  inter alia: recognizes the pre-eminent and independent role of the  IPCC; recognizes the need for stronger links between national,  regional, and international climate change research programmes;  and urges Annex I Parties to further strengthen the engagement of  research institutions from developing countries.

# COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

### IPCC REPORT ON SAFEGUARDING THE OZONE LAYER AND GLOBAL CLIMATE  SYSTEM: HYDROFLUOROCARBONS AND PERFLUOROCARBONS

This matter was  first taken up by SBSTA on Thursday, 19 May, when Susan Solomon  and Bert Metz of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) presented the main findings of the new IPCC special report  that examines the alternatives to ozone-depleting substances that  affect the global climate system. Uruguay, Kenya and Japan called  for coordinated work between the Montreal Protocol and the UNFCCC  on this issue. Australia argued that further consideration by  SBSTA was unnecessary, and encouraged domestic action. The matter  was referred to a contact group chaired by Darren Goetze (Canada).

In the contact group, which met three times, differences soon  emerged over a SBSTA follow-up process. The UK, for the EU, wanted  to establish a SBSTA process to follow up on the report,  suggesting an expert meeting or workshop. The US and others  rejected the proposal for a workshop, arguing that the report  provides a sound basis for countries to take action. The US also  expressed reservations about inviting submissions from Parties on  this matter.

In addition, there were disagreements over text inviting the  Montreal Protocol to make a statement at a future session of  SBSTA. China, Saudi Arabia and Jamaica proposed removing this  text, while the EU, Norway and Senegal wanted to retain it.  Delegates eventually agreed on a compromise in the group that  welcomed information from the Secretariat of the Montreal Protocol  and invited submissions from UNFCCC Parties, while also agreeing  that consideration of this issue should be finalized at SBSTA 24.  The decision does not refer to a workshop or other meeting.

On Friday, 27 May, SBSTA considered the draft conclusions. Saudi  Arabia suggested an alteration to text inviting Parties to submit  their views on the IPCC report, so that submissions would address  aspects of the report relevant to the UNFCCC's 'implementation,'  rather than its 'objective.' After the EU, G-77/China, and other  Parties said they supported the text as it stood, Saudi Arabia  withdrew its suggestion and the conclusions were adopted without  amendment.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.8), SBSTA  thanks the IPCC and the Montreal Protocol's Technology and  Economic Assessment Panel for completing the Special Report on  Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System: Issues  Related to Hydrofluorocarbons and Perfluorocarbons. SBSTA also  encourages Parties to use the information in the report when  developing and implementing national climate change strategies. It  notes the ongoing need for research, measurement and systematic  observation relevant to the ozone layer, the global climate system  and potential interrelations. It welcomes information from the  Secretariat for the Montreal Protocol on any consideration given  to the report by the MOP to the Montreal Protocol by SBSTA 24.  Finally, SBSTA invites Parties to submit to the UNFCCC  Secretariat, by 13 February 2006, their views on aspects of the  report relevant to the UNFCCC's objective. It asks the Secretariat  to compile these views for consideration at SBSTA 24, with a view  to finalizing consideration of this agenda item.

### INTERNATIONAL MEETING TO REVIEW THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE  PROGRAMME OF ACTION FOR SIDS

This issue was taken up by SBSTA on  Thursday, 19 May, when Tuvalu, for AOSIS, noted that the UN  General Assembly will consider the Mauritius Strategy during its  upcoming session, and proposed that SBSTA consider the Strategy at  SBSTA 23. SBSTA Vice-Chair Abdulla said he would undertake  informal consultations on this issue.

During the informal consultations held over the following week,  differences emerged over whether there should be a follow-up  process on how the UNFCCC could help implement the Mauritius  Strategy further, and on what the process might involve. AOSIS,  the EU and the G-77/China sought a process that would invite  submissions and address the issue at COP 11, while the US said  there was no need for further UNFCCC work on this matter, and  preferred shorter text taking note of the Mauritius Strategy.

Two additional paragraphs proposed by the EU also caused some  disagreement. The US, Canada, India and others objected to  EU-proposed text addressing climate change and sea-level rise in  the context of the Millennium Review in September 2005. Delegates  also discussed text proposed by the EU that would link the  prioritization of energy efficiency and renewable energy under the  Mauritius Strategy with the fourteenth and fifteenth sessions of  the Commission on Sustainable Development in 2006-2007. The  Commission will focus on energy issues at those sessions.

An attempt at a compromise formulation on the process was proposed  on Wednesday, 25 May by Australia, suggesting text inviting  Parties to submit 'views on further implementation of relevant  aspects of the Mauritius Declaration and Strategy through ongoing  work of the SBI and SBSTA, as appropriate.' However, Australia  subsequently withdrew that proposal and replaced it with another  formulation that invited Parties to continue to take into account  the issue in the ongoing work of the SBSTA, as appropriate.

During the SBSTA plenary on Friday, 27 May, Canada, the US,  New Zealand and Japan supported Australia's second proposal.  However, AOSIS and the EU could not agree to it, with Tuvalu,  speaking for AOSIS, suggesting that 'certain Parties have no room  for flexibility.' Mauritius said he could support the earlier  Australian proposal, but not the second. SBSTA plenary was  suspended to allow Parties to consider the Australian proposal.  Following further consultations, SBSTA Chair Benrageb reported  that no agreement could be reached, and that this would be  recorded in the report of the meeting.

Parties then discussed whether this agenda item should reappear on  SBSTA 23's agenda, as set out in the most recent version of the  draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.12). The US argued that the  item had been dealt with, even though conclusions had not been  agreed, since the original request from COP 10 was simply that the  Secretariat report to SBSTA 22 on the SIDS International Meeting.  He also argued that the concerns of SIDS were being addressed  under other agenda items, such as those on adaptation, technology  transfer, and capacity building.

AOSIS, the EU, the G-77/China, and Antigua and Barbuda disagreed  with the US, stating that, as consideration of this item had not  been concluded, the rules of procedure dictated that it be taken  up at the next SBSTA session. No conclusions were agreed on this  matter.

### GLOBAL CLIMATE OBSERVING SYSTEM

SBSTA considered this matter  briefly on Thursday, 19 May, when Vice-Chair Abdulla said he would  draft conclusions on the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS),  and noted concerns voiced by Argentina about territorial water  issues and drifting buoys. Conclusions were adopted on the issue  on Friday, 27 May.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.9), SBSTA  welcomes the report on progress towards implementing the initial  ocean climate observing system, prepared by the GCOS Secretariat  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/MISC/5). It also welcomes the report on analysis  of data exchange issues in global atmospheric and hydrological  networks (WMO/DT 1255 GCOS96) and agrees to consider these reports  in the context of consideration of the Implementation Plan for the  Global Observing System for Climate in Support of the UNFCCC at  SBSTA 23. Parties are also invited to submit their views on these  reports by 15 September 2005.

# OTHER MATTERS

### IMPLEMENTATION OF KYOTO PROTOCOL ARTICLE 2.3

Issues relating to  the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of  P&Ms) were first addressed by SBSTA in plenary on Thursday, 19  May. SBSTA Chair Benrageb was mandated to convene informal  consultations on the issue. During informal negotiations, some  Parties expressed the view that this agenda item should be  considered by the COP/MOP instead of SBSTA as at previous  sessions. In SBSTA plenary on Friday, 27 May, Chair Benrageb  reported that Parties were unable to reach agreement for the third  consecutive session. As at previous sessions, brief conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.5) were adopted by SBSTA 22.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.5), SBSTA  notes that it did not complete its consideration of issues  relating to Protocol Article 2.3, and agrees to continue  consideration of these issues at SBSTA 23.

# CLOSING PLENARY

On Friday, 27 May, SBSTA 22 held its closing plenary meeting.  SBSTA Chair Benrageb expressed regrets that he had not been  present earlier in the session, and thanked Vice-Chair Abdulla for  chairing SBSTA in his absence.

Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter congratulated Chair  Benrageb and Vice-Chair Abdulla for their efforts, which she said  had resulted in a successful session where many issues were  advanced. She indicated that a preliminary evaluation of the SBSTA  conclusions agreed at this session implied additional resources of  about US$130,000, and stated that any additional support would be  highly appreciated. She added that COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 in  Montreal would be 'landmark' events.

SBSTA then adopted its report of the session (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.1).  Thanking the contact group Chairs, delegates, interpreters and  everyone involved, Chair Benrageb declared the meeting closed  shortly after 4:00 pm.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

SBI Chair Thomas Becker (Denmark) opened the session on Friday  morning, 20 May. Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter stated  that SBI 22 was an opportunity to complete work on various issues  left unfinished at COP 10, and to address other items, including  improving the intergovernmental process, arrangements for COP 11  and COP/MOP 1, and financial matters.

On Friday morning, 20 May, delegates discussed the provisional  agenda (FCCC/SBI/2005/1 and Add.1) in detail, particularly  additions proposed by Saudi Arabia on implementation of UNFCCC  Article 4.8 (adverse effects) and 4.9 (LDCs)  (FCCC/SBI/2005/1/Add.2), and one on capacity building proposed by  the G-77/China. The EU and Environmental Integrity Group supported  the agenda without amendments, while the Africa Group and AOSIS  supported adding an item on capacity building. The Umbrella Group  opposed Saudi Arabia's proposal and sought more information on the  capacity building proposal. Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Oman, Egypt,  Algeria, Qatar, Pakistan, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates  supported the additions.

Delegates agreed to begin work based on the original provisional  agenda while consultations were held. SBI returned to the matter  on Monday, 23 May, when Chair Becker proposed that those items be  included under the agenda item on Other Matters. Following  informal consultations, delegates accepted the Chair's proposal  and adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBI/2005/1 and Add.1).

# NON-ANNEX I PARTIES' NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM NON-ANNEX I PARTIES

After remaining  unresolved since COP 9, timeframes for non-Annex I Parties'  submissions of second and, where appropriate, third national  communications and related issues were finally resolved at SBI 22  following a series of informal consultations held from 23-25 May.  The consultations were facilitated by Soobaraj Nayroo Sok Appadu  (Mauritius) and Anders Turesson (Sweden).

Discussions held on this matter at SB 22 focused on a timeframe  for submissions combined with a possible extension period, as  conceived in an earlier proposal by Australia. Delegates from GEF  donor countries sought to ensure that any extensions would have no  impact on current GEF guidance on funding for non-Annex I national  communications. The G-77/China sought to assure GEF donor  countries that it was the timeframe, and not additional funding,  that was the issue. The EU, Japan, Australia, US and Canada agreed  to drop a reference to a three-year project preparation period and  proposed an additional reference, stating that any extensions will  not imply additional GEF funding. This was accepted by the  G-77/China in a package that included agreement to further  consider these issues at COP 15 and permit LDCs to submit second  communications at their discretion. This agreement was adopted by  SBI on Thursday, 26 May.

###     SBI Conclusions and Draft COP Decision

In its conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.9), the SBI agrees to include a draft decision  recommended for adoption by COP 11, stating that non-Annex I  Parties shall make all efforts to submit second and, where  appropriate, third national communications, within four years of  initial disbursement for the actual preparation of the national  communication, on an agreed full-cost basis.

In the draft COP decision, the COP notes that Parties, if  necessary and based on their national circumstances, may use an  extension of up to one year for submission, after informing the  Secretariat; and that any extensions shall not imply additional  financial resources from the GEF. LDCs may submit their second  national communications at their discretion, and discussion on  further implementation of Article 12.5 (national communications)  will be taken up at COP 15 in 2009.

### COMPILATION AND SYNTHESIS OF INITIAL NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Draft conclusions on the compilation and synthesis of initial  national communications were drawn up by SBI Chair Becker, and  adopted by SBI on Thursday evening, 26 May.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.8), SBI notes  its consideration of document FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.2 containing the  list of projects submitted by non-Annex I Parties in accordance  with UNFCCC Article 12.4 (projects proposed by developing  countries). The recommendation to COP 11 requests the GEF, in  accordance with Article 12.4 and decision 11/CP.1 (funding for  adaptation), to assist, if requested, non-Annex I Parties in  formulating and developing project proposals identified in their  national communications, when Parties are formulating national  programmes to address climate change issues. Bilateral and  multilateral assistance programmes are invited to offer similar  assistance.

### WORK OF THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF EXPERTS ON NATIONAL  COMMUNICATIONS FROM NON-ANNEX I PARTIES

This issue was first  raised at an SBI plenary session on Friday, 20 May, when Emily  Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya), Chair of the Consultative Group of Experts  on non-Annex I national communications (CGE), made an oral  presentation based on a progress report on the CGE's work  (FCCC/SBI/2005/7), including a meeting in Mozambique, and CGE  hands-on training workshops for the Asia and Africa regions. The  US indicated his appreciation of the CGE's work and invited other  countries to follow up his country's financial support for its  work. Switzerland underlined the importance of support from the  UNFCCC Secretariat and the UNDP and UNEP's National Communications  Support Programme (NCSP).

Draft conclusions on the work of the Consultative Group of Experts  (CGE) were subsequently drawn up by SBI Chair Becker, in  consultation with the Secretariat and interested Parties. They  were adopted by the SBI on Thursday, 26 May.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.11), the SBI  notes the oral report of the Chair of the CGE and the outcomes of  CGE hands-on training workshops. The SBI further notes  recommendations in the CGE report (FCCC/SBI/2005/7) on further  improvement of training materials and on future training  workshops. SBSTA also notes that the CGE's meetings, not more than  twice a year, are critical, and notes progress on collaboration  with the GEF-funded NCSP. A CGE workshop on mitigation is  tentatively scheduled to be held in the Republic of Korea from  26-30 September 2005, though some funding remains outstanding. The  SBI requests that the CGE, in its work programme for 2006-2007,  continues to explore the possibility of a joint session with other  expert groups.

### PROVISION OF FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

After being briefly  considered in plenary on Friday, 20 May, draft conclusions on the  provision of financial and technical support provided by GEF for  the preparation of initial and subsequent national communications  were drawn up by SBI Chair Becker. SBI adopted conclusions on this  item on Thursday, 26 May.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.7), SBI  welcomes information by the GEF Secretariat on financial support  made available for the preparation of initial and subsequent  national communications (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.1). The SBI notes that  the GEF continues to provide information on non-Annex I Parties  that have not yet submitted initial and/or subsequent  communications, and requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to report to  SBI 24. SBI also notes a document (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.3) on Parties  that have not submitted initial national communications, and  requests them to do so as soon as possible. SBI further notes that  LDCs may submit their communications at their discretion.

# FINANCIAL MECHANISM

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND

This issue was first addressed by SBI  on Friday, 20 May. Several Parties expressed their disappointment  that this matter was not resolved at COP 10. The EU cited the EU  funding pledge to the SCCF for adaptation and technology.  Bangladesh, for LDCs, said that LDCs should be able to access the  SCCF for adaptation needs.

The issue was then taken up in informal consultations and a  contact group, which met twice and was co-chaired by Jozef Buys  (Belgium) and Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya). Main areas of debate  were the priorities and focal areas for the Fund. The G-77/China  opposed an EU proposal that funding shall 'support technical  assistance.' The EU argued, that such wording would allow the Fund  to bring added value to whatever is already being undertaken  elsewhere, whereas the G-77/China said this wording was  inconsistent with decision 5/CP.7 (implementation of UNFCCC  Article 4.8 and 4.9). This tied in with disagreement over text  referring to funding for economic diversification and for the  development of non-energy uses of fossil fuels. The EU argued that  the purpose of economic diversification is to reduce dependence on  one commodity, while the G-77/China noted that since many  countries have only one resource, making that resource less  polluting should be a purpose of the Fund.

On Thursday, 26 May, the contact group Co-Chairs informed Parties  that it had not been possible to reach an agreement, and the draft  COP decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.13) was forwarded to SB 23 for  further consideration. Much of the text remains bracketed,  particularly the paragraphs that identify priority areas for the  Fund. SBI Chair Becker urged delegates to arrive at COP 11 with  more flexible mandates to allow for an agreement. The EU noted  that a more determined effort will be needed to reach agreement at  COP 11, and that in the interim the EU will work with the GEF to  ensure that its existing funding commitments are properly  implemented.

# IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

### MATTERS RELATING TO THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

This issue was  first addressed by the SBI, on Friday, 20 May, when delegates were  briefed by LDC Expert Group (LEG) Chair Paul Desanker (Malawi) on  the LEG's April 2005 meeting, and by Ricardo Moita (Portugal) and  Richard Muyungi (Tanzania) on pre-sessional activities involving  representatives from a number of Annex II Parties, LDCs, the GEF  and implementing agencies. Many Parties noted the positive  atmosphere at the pre-sessional activities, and the need to agree  on the operation of the LDC Fund and to move forward on  implementation. Ricardo Moita and Bubu Pateh Jallow (Gambia)  agreed to co-chair a contact group.

The contact group met five times from 23-26 May, and on numerous  occasions informally. After holding informal consultations and  preparing draft SBI conclusions and a draft COP 11 decision, SBI  Chair Becker chaired the final contact group meeting.

Much of the debate centered on an EU proposal, supported by  several others, that funding from the LDC Fund should support  priority adaptation activities identified in the National  Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) that are 'additional' to  activities that would be undertaken to respond to climate  variability. LDCs noted the difficulties associated with  differentiating between climate variability and climate change.  Delegates also discussed, in detail, a co-financing scale that  would be developed for those activities that do not receive  full-cost funding. LDCs stressed the need to reference their  'unique circumstances' in developing the scale.

Agreement was finally reached on a draft decision for COP 11  immediately prior to the SBI plenary meeting on Thursday, 26 May.

###     SBI Conclusions and Draft COP Decision

The SBI conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.14/Add.1) contain a draft COP decision, in which  the COP states that the operation of the LDC Fund should be  consistent with the following principles:a country-driven approach, supporting the implementation of  urgent and immediate activities identified in NAPAs, as a way of  enhancing adaptive capacity; support for implementation of activities identified in NAPAs  and of other elements of the LDC work programme as identified in  decision 5/CP.7, to promote the integration of adaptation measures  in national development and poverty reduction strategies, plans or  policies, with a view to increasing resilience to the adverse  effects of climate change; and support for a learning-by-doing approach.

Also included in the draft decision are:a decision that full-cost funding shall be provided by the  LDC Fund to meet the additional costs - defined as 'the costs  imposed on vulnerable countries to meet their immediate adaptation  need' - of activities to adopt to the adverse effects of climate  change as identified and prioritized in the NAPAs; a request that GEF develop a co-financing scale for  supporting activities identified in the NAPAs, taking into account  the circumstances of LDCs; a decision that activities identified in NAPAs that are not  supported through full-cost funding as described above will be  co-financed through the co-financing scale; a request that SBI 23 review experience gained from the  implementation of NAPAs, including those in accessing funds from  the LDC Fund; and a decision that COP 14 is to assess progress and consider the  adoption of further guidance, as appropriate.

# ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

The agenda item on arrangements for intergovernmental meetings was  first taken up by SBI in plenary on Friday, 20 May, when COP  Secretary Richard Kinley briefed delegates on the sub-items under  this agenda, namely, preparations for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 in  Montreal (FCCC/SBI/2005/4 and Corr.1), future sessional periods,  organization of the intergovernmental process, and observer  organizations in the UNFCCC process.

On future sessional periods, Richard Kinley noted an IPCC request  to postpone COP 13 for three or four weeks to avoid it occurring  too soon after the finalization of the synthesis report of the  IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report. He also noted a recent workshop  on ways to improve the organization of the intergovernmental  process (FCCC/SBI/2005/2), and noted ongoing work in the UN on the  involvement of civil society. Karsten Sach (Germany) agreed to  chair a contact group on this agenda item.

The contact group met three times and considered all of the  sub-items. On the issue of future sessional periods, there were  initial differences of opinion over the IPCC's request to postpone  COP 13. Australia, Japan, India, the EU, New Zealand and others  supported the IPCC request, while Saudi Arabia and China suggested  that the IPCC Report could be taken up at COP 14. Parties  eventually agreed to the request.

Delegates discussed possible improvements to the future  negotiating process in some detail. While there was general  agreement on the need to find ways to improve the process and  address problems with heavy agendas and workloads, there were a  range of views on how this could be achieved. While some Parties,  such as Norway and Canada, suggested that some proposals could be  implemented immediately, Saudi Arabia urged further discussion.  Parties eventually agreed to continue work on this matter at  SBI 24.

On Friday, 27 May, Karsten Sach reported back to plenary on the  contact group discussions and introduced draft conclusions. On the  intergovernmental process, he noted agreement to 'further explore  possible options for improvement.' However, noting complaints  about the multiple contact groups and the heavy agenda, he urged  Parties to reflect on possible solutions prior to COP 11 and COP  /MOP 1, observing that 'we don't want to learn this lesson the  hard way.' SBI adopted the conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

The conclusions, (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.4) address  arrangements relating to COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, future sessional  periods, organization of the intergovernmental process, and  observer organizations in the Convention process.

On COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, the SBI thanks the Government of Canada  for offering to host the event, and requests the host country to  facilitate the issuance of visas to ensure Parties' effective  participation. It endorses the dates of 7-9 December, 2005, for  the high-level segment of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, asks the Executive  Secretary to take note of Parties' views on possible elements for  the provisional agendas, and urges Parties to enhance their  contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC  Process.

On future sessional periods, it notes the dates for COP 12 and  COP/MOP 2 (6-17 November 2006), urges Parties to make offers to  host the meeting, and notes that the President of COP 12 will come  from the African Group of countries. SBI also recommends 31 May to  11 June and 8-19 November 2010 for the sessional periods that  year, and recommends changing the dates of COP 13 from November  2007 to 3-14 December 2007.

On organization of the intergovernmental process, SBI takes note  of the workshop held during SBI 21, notes the increasing  difficulties facing the intergovernmental process in terms of  extensive agendas and other problems, and invites Parties to  submit their views on options for further improvements by 15  November 2005. SBI also agrees to continue consideration of this  issue at SBI 24, and requests the Secretariat to identify options,  taking into account Parties' views and experiences from COP/MOP 1.

Regarding observer organizations, SBI notes the ongoing work of  the UN and the report of the Secretary-General on observer  participation. It notes that many of the steps recommended by the  Secretary-General are already part of established UNFCCC practice,  and asks the UNFCCC Secretariat to identify ways to enhance  further the participation of observer organizations, drawing on  outcomes of the wider UN process. SBI will take up the matter at  SBI 26 in May 2007.

# ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

### BUDGET PERFORMANCE FOR THE BIENNIUM 2004-2005

This issue was  first addressed by SBI in plenary on Friday, 20 May. The  Secretariat's opening remarks focused on the funding shortfall due  to outstanding contributions from Parties. SBI Chair Becker said  he would consult informally with Parties and prepare draft  conclusions. In the SBI plenary on Thursday, 26 May, Parties  adopted the conclusions without comment.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.5), SBI takes  note of the interim financial statements (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.4),  expresses concern over the considerable amount of outstanding  contributions, and urges Parties that have not yet made their  contributions to do so as soon as possible. It notes with concern  the shortfall in supplementary funding in comparison with  requirements, which have led to delays in implementation of key  activities, and decides to discuss this matter further at SB 23.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2006-2007

This issue was first  addressed by the SBI on Friday, 20 May. The Secretariat gave an  overview of the proposed budget, which consists of a 0.5% real  increase in Euros, equaling a 22% increase in US dollars. The  Secretariat noted that while activities have increased due to the  entry into force of the Protocol, the depreciation of the US  dollar against the Euro has reduced the Secretariat's funding,  given that most of its expenses are in Euros. The US noted that it  could not agree to either the budgetary increase or the proposal  to fix the budget in Euros rather than US dollars. The EU  supported the budget, as proposed. John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda)  agreed to chair a contact group.

The contact group met three times between 21 and 26 May, while  informal consultations also took place throughout the week. The  overall level of the proposed budget and the proposal to fix the  budget in Euros continued to be the two main points of contention,  while the G-77/China sought to ensure that commitments for four  annual meetings of the three expert groups were met.

At the contact group meeting on Thursday, 26 May, Chair Ashe  presented a revised budget proposal consisting of total income of  US$55,251,583, which was supported by the EU and G-77/China. The  US proposed reducing the UNFCCC budget by US$2 million, while  Japan proposed reducing the overall budget by US$3 million.  Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter noted that a US$2 million  reduction would 'seriously affect the operations of the  Secretariat.' Lacking an agreement, Chair Ashe closed the meeting  and suggested forwarding the text to SB 23.

Informal consultations, with the involvement of SBI Chair Becker,  continued throughout that afternoon and evening. The SBI plenary  was suspended until Friday morning, 27 May, to allow for further  deliberation.

The SBI reached agreement on the budget on Friday morning. The  final agreement was for an overall core programme budget of  US$53,501,583, which includes US$2,037,020 in contributions from  the host country and US$2,000,000 in carry-over. This represents a  US$1.75 million reduction from the original proposal.

At the final plenary, Jamaica, for the G-77/China, noted that the  group had gone along with the agreement under great duress, and  that it was 'embarrassed' to be part of a decision that sends the  wrong signal to the global community about Parties' commitment to  the climate change process. She also noted that the budget has no  specific activities for capacity building, which should be at the  forefront of UNFCCC deliberations.

Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter noted that the final  agreement will not impact any of the three key work areas -  adaptation, support to non-Annex I Parties, and infrastructure for  the Protocol - nor the work of the three expert groups, or  activities associated with the CDM, JI, and implementation.  However, impacts would be felt on items such as staff travel,  training, consultancy work, the organization of in-depth reviews  of national communications from Annex I Parties, dissemination of  information, and development of a new UNFCCC website.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.15/Rev.1),  SBI decides to: recommend that COP 11 approve the core programme  budget for the biennium 2006-2007; propose a contingency budget  for conference services of US$7,828, 611; authorize the Executive  Secretary to notify Parties of their 2006 contributions; and  requests the Executive Secretary to prepare a revision of document  FCCC/SBI/2005/8/Add.1 that will contain the mandates for the  activities reflected therein.

### FINANCIAL PROCEDURES CONCERNING SUPPORT FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE  UNFCCC PROCESS

Implementation of paragraph 7(c) of the UNFCCC's  Financial Procedures (financial support for participation) was  first addressed by SBI in plenary on Friday, 20 May. The  Secretariat noted that, at the request of SB 19, it had suspended  its practice of withdrawing funding to Parties to participate in  the UNFCCC process if they had outstanding contributions to the  core budget. Argentina noted that this incentive only affects  developing countries because only they request financial help to  attend meetings. A shortage of contributions means that only half  the support needed for delegates might be available for COP 11 and  COP/MOP 1. SBI Chair Becker said he would consult informally with  Parties and prepare draft conclusions. In the plenary meeting on  Thursday, 26 May, SBI adopted conclusions on this sub-item  following minor textual amendments proposed by Australia.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.10), SBI  takes note of document FCCC/SBI/2005/3 regarding the suspension of  this practice, decides that more time is required to determine the  financial implications of the suspension and decides to maintain  the status quo through 31 December 2007. The Secretariat is  requested to report on this issue at SB 26. The SBI also expresses  concern over the continued shortfall in contributions to the Trust  Fund for Participation in the UNFCCC process, which makes it  difficult to comply fully with, and implement, paragraph 7(c) of  the financial procedures for the Convention.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT

This issue was taken  up briefly in SBI plenary on Friday, 20 May, when Germany and  Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter reported on the  Headquarters Agreement and on progress on extending it to cover  the Protocol. Short draft conclusions were prepared and adopted  without comment on Friday, 27 May.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.2), the SBI  takes note of the statements of the host government and the  Executive Secretary at SBI 22, requests the Executive Secretary to  inform SBI of any new developments, and invites the host  government to report on further progress with implementing the  Headquarters Agreement at SBI 24.

### INTERNAL REVIEW OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THE SECRETARIAT

The internal  review of the Secretariat's activities was taken up by SBI in  plenary on Friday, 20 May, when Joke Waller-Hunter reported on an  interim review (FCCC/SBI/2005/6), noting a lack of resources to  meet demands, and inviting guidance from Parties. Harald Dovland  (Norway) agreed to chair a contact group, and circulated draft  conclusions to the contact group on Saturday, 21 May. The group  met twice. In the group's discussions, the EU sought to amend a  paragraph on work with other international organizations,  specifying that cooperation and communication should be focused  and add value. However, after objections from the US, the  paragraph was deleted. Japan and Switzerland added that efforts  should be conducted within available resources. Conclusions were  adopted by SBI on Friday, 27 May.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions on this matter  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.6), SBI notes the volume and scope of the  Secretariat's activities, and encourages the Executive Secretary  to address challenges faced and implement initiatives set out in  her report (FCCC/SBI/2005/6, Annex I). SBI also recommends a draft  decision to the COP (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.6/Add.1), including that the  COP should recall its decisions on the mandates of its expert  groups and invite the expert groups' chairs to ensure that their  requests to the Secretariat are within their mandates and  resources available for such activities. The recommendations to  the COP also underline the importance of the timeliness and  quality of documentation, and would have the COP recognize the  'advantage of Parties exercising discipline when requesting the  Secretariat to prepare documents.' The recommendations also  request the Secretariat to keep Parties informed of the  information systems available.

# OTHER MATTERS

### LEVEL OF EMISSIONS FOR THE BASE YEAR OF CROATIA

SBI Chair Becker  introduced this issue on Friday, 20 May, noting that it had been  on the agenda for several years, and expressing hope that it could  be resolved at this meeting. The EU supported Croatia's proposal  for its emissions baselines for 1990, while Bosnia and Herzegovina  and Serbia and Montenegro expressed their reservations. Informal  consultations chaired by Jim Penman (UK) resolved the issue, and  SBI agreed to forward conclusions containing a draft decision to  the COP for its consideration.

###     SBI Conclusions and Draft COP Decision

The SBI conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.3) on flexibility for Croatia under UNFCCC  Article 4.6 (flexibility for EIT Annex I Parties) contain a draft  decision for COP 11. In the draft decision, the COP confirms that  Croatia shall be allowed a certain degree of flexibility with  regard to its historical level of greenhouse gas emissions, and  decides that SBI will consider the level of emissions for  Croatia's base year at a future session.

### CLIMATE NEUTRAL UNFCCC MEETINGS

This item was first taken on  Friday, 20 May, when SBI considered a report on making UNFCCC  meetings 'climate neutral' (FCCC/SBI/2005/9). The US and Saudi  Arabia opposed a proposal to make UNFCCC meetings climate neutral,  noting the heavy agenda of other pressing issues, and arguing that  it was the prerogative of individual countries to decide on this  when hosting UNFCCC meetings. In spite of support for the proposal  from Micronesia and Trinidad and Tobago, the final draft  conclusions do not propose making all UNFCCC meetings climate  neutral, and instead refer only to Canada's statement that it  intends to make COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 climate neutral.

###     SBI Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.12), SBI  welcomes Canada's statement that it intends to make COP 11 and  COP/MOP 1 climate neutral.

### ISSUES RELATING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 1/CP.10

On  Friday, 27 May, SBI Chair Becker noted in plenary that three  submissions had been made at SB 22 on decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos  Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures). He  explained that these were contained in a document  (FCCC/SBI/2005/Misc.2) that will be referenced in the final report  of SBI 22, under the item 'Any other matters.'

# CLOSING PLENARY

On Friday, 27 May, Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter made a  statement in which she noted that SBI had completed work on some  longstanding issues, labeling this a 'major success.' She also  noted that SBI conclusions from this session did not have any  specific implications for the budget. However, she added that the  shortfall in budget resources overall was 'serious' and that the  Participation Fund is badly depleted. She also drew attention to  the very heavy provisional agenda for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1. SBI  then adopted its report of the session (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.1).

SBI Chair Thomas Becker thanked participants, interpreters,  security and the 'fantastic Secretariat.' Jamaica, speaking for  the G-77/China, congratulated delegates on resolving issues such  as non-Annex I national communications, but expressed 'extreme  disappointment' at lack of progress on the SCCF. Luxembourg,  speaking for the EU, said SBI had made good progress. The meeting  closed at 11:15 am.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF SB 22 CALM BEFORE THE STORM?

'I got involved after suffering panic attacks over climate change.' Thom Yorke, Radiohead lead singer There was no evidence of panic in the corridors of the Maritim  Hotel in Bonn during the week and a half of UNFCCC Subsidiary Body  meetings (SB 22). Delegates and Secretariat staff alike appeared  to be taking their history-making preparations for the first COP  serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in  stride. On a number of occasions, however, allusions to some major  questions for the COP/MOP exposed potential fault lines, including  a bid to force a debate in Montreal on amending the Kyoto Protocol  with regard to the compliance mechanism and its bodies, and  debates on the side about a 'trigger' for post-2012 discussions.  The business-like approach at SB 22 nevertheless led to the  resolution of some long standing issues, including the timing of  non-Annex I national communications and the LDC Fund.

On a number of fronts, SB 22 was buoyed by the momentum created by  the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol earlier this year,  which carried over into the pre-session Seminar of Governmental  Experts (SOGE).

This analysis will survey the treatment of a number of issues at  SB 22 and provide a snapshot of the negotiating landscape as we  look forward to the COP/MOP. It will examine issues through the  lens of confidence building and issues to look out for at the  COP/MOP as the process heads into uncharted waters.

# CARBON COP

### GROWING PAINS AND THE NEW CARBON MARKET

It is widely believed that, given the current discussions on the  post-2012 scenario, the COP/MOP must - at the very least - send  out a strong signal of forward-looking confidence and durability  to the world, to governments and, not least, to the markets where  carbon has now been established by the climate change regime as a  viable commodity. A carbon market has been created and is now in  its early days of functioning, thanks to the EU emissions trading  scheme and other initiatives. An early indicator of the climate  regime's success is that SB 22 coincided with news in Europe that  the market price of an allowance to emit a metric ton of carbon  dioxide hit a record high of €19.

# CDM 'COULD DO MORE'

Some experts have suggested that the price is now approaching a  level that will encourage energy market players and utilities to  switch to cleaner forms of power generation, thus underlining the  importance of debates around the G-8 and at the SOGE on long-range  decisions on technology investment and deployment.

There was much discussion - inside the negotiating rooms and in  the corridors - about the future management of the CDM, as  companies and countries have grown impatient over the three years  it has taken to establish national and international level  CDM-related institutions and approve the first projects. With  entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol these companies and  countries have grown nervous at the prospect of meeting  commitments and the need to be sure they can make use of the  Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs) generated by CDM project  investments. The CDM is a confidence-building instrument for  developing countries. However, it is the confidence of the  market and business that has become a pressing concern, and  this has come down to a concerted campaign to question the  additionality requirement for CDM projects.

Under the surface of this discussion, which pitches advocates for  the environmental integrity of the CDM against those who are  lobbying hard for easier access to CERs and 'efficiency,' there  are growing tensions. Pressure has reportedly been brought to bear  on the CDM's Executive Board. The CDM's managers are now  increasingly exposed to the hard-nosed politics of the business  and investment community, such that the air in some quarters of  the Maritim Hotel was thick with talk of legal challenges and  steps to provide legal cover for Board members.

At the Carbon Expo in Cologne, Germany, held the week prior to  SB 22, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Waller-Hunter raised another  concern. She expressed some frustration that the ambitions of  governments for the CDM and the reality of resources committed  have not always matched. This has caused frustrations on all  sides, not least in the Secretariat, which would like to step up  its technical support to the CDM Executive Board and its Panels.  The CDM funding issues can be traced back, in part, to some of the  budgeting complications created by the absence of the US from the  Kyoto Protocol, and the subsequent need to separate out UNFCCC and  Protocol budget lines, and rely on the Supplementary Trust Fund.

This is a debate to look out for at the COP/MOP, where one of the  agenda items will include a report from the CDM Executive Board.  Naturally, the Canadian Presidency of the COP/MOP is taking an  interest in this issue and is determined to make a contribution to  the smooth functioning of the CDM. Canada is keen on credits, and  they are proving hard to come by due to the complexity of the  current CDM process. It is anticipated that the COP/MOP debate  will address the question of whether the CDM infrastructure can  measure up to the demands of a new stream of projects, which will  soon be measured in hundreds rather than in tens. The CDM  Executive Board will meet again in July, in Bonn, to finalize its  management plan, including improvements in the methodological  panel, which is expected to expand from 10 to 15 members.

Some have begun to canvass the need to raise the CDM game  altogether, by shifting its responsibilities out of the  Secretariat's ambit. Potential users of the CDM have been warned  that any attempt to reopen the Marrakesh Accords in the short-term  could be self-defeating, as this could result in a situation where  no CDM credits could be used in the first commitment period.

# GOOD COP, BAD MOP? SOME ISSUES TO LOOK OUT FOR AT COP 11 AND  COP/MOP 1

There are few expectations that Parties will emerge from the  COP/MOP with a 'Montreal Mandate' (as mooted by South Africa at  the SOGE), that actually establishes the post-2012 framework.  However, at the very least, it is anticipated that no options will  be foreclosed. On the fringes of SB 22, the EU and AOSIS met with  the Canadian Presidency to discuss the possibility of  reintroducing the so called 'Estrada Approach' to trigger a  COP/MOP discussion on post-2012. This would see the Presidency  introducing an agenda item on the matter.

Key issues for the COP/MOP that will help shape the quality of the  outcome - and determine confidence in the future of the process -  will be the establishment of a Compliance Committee and the  upgrading of work on adaptation.

# A COMPLIANCE MECHANISM

While a legally-binding compliance mechanism is recognized as an  essential component of domestic legal regimes, the Kyoto Protocol  compliance mechanism will break new ground in its scope and  complexity. There is still a debate on how this issue will be  addressed at the COP/MOP. The options are to adopt a decision or  to amend the Kyoto Protocol.

On the final day of SB 22, delegates found text from Saudi Arabia  being circulated from the document counter. The 14-page document  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/2) sets out a Saudi proposal that Parties take  the Protocol amendment approach to operationalizing compliance.  The Saudi proposal deals with the procedures and mechanisms  relating to compliance under the Kyoto Protocol e.g. the  Compliance Committee, the Facilitative and Enforcement Branches,  appeals and consequences. Champions of the Protocol fear that the  amendment approach using Protocol Article 18 and 20.1, as opposed  to adopting a COP decision, will delay significantly the  implementation of the compliance procedures, because an amendment  would require ratification by all the Parties. Moreover, opening  the Protocol up for an amendment would establish a precedent,  which could take the process down some unanticipated roads.

A Compliance Committee is expected to be established at the  COP/MOP, and members are expected to be elected. The compliance  mechanism, one of the institutional guardians of the integrity of  the Protocol, will be responsible for reviewing implementation and  in-depth reviews. It is understood that non-compliance with the  standards set down for reporting could lead to the  disqualification of Parties from making use of the flexible  mechanisms. Discussions at SB 22 touched on compliance when it was  noted that the Facilitative Branch could begin its work  immediately to support EITs in their attempts to address LULUCF  issues.

# ADAPTATION AND LIABILITY

Adaptation was another issue where deliberations at the SOGE  spilled over into deliberations at SB 22, with the development of  a five-year 'skeleton' programme of work the focus of discussion,  in response to an important COP 10 decision. However, the subtext  of discussions on adaptation has exposed another potential fault  line in the negotiations leading up to the COP/MOP. It is expected  that the methodological work on adaptation will increase to  approach the level of work on mitigation methodologies. It is fair  to question whether this is effective - mitigation is after all  the cornerstone of the Protocol and the most important activity  for reducing the overall impact of climate change on human  societies. Look out for renewed emphasis on cost effectiveness and  equity concerns.

Not far from the surface of discussions on the quality of the  five-year programme, some participants have detected a growing  nervousness on the part of heavy polluters about the possibility  of exposing themselves to liability for adaptation costs. The  linkage (which some believe could be turned into a basis for  litigation) has been established in UNFCCC Article 4.4. This  article states that developed country Parties shall assist  developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable, in  meeting the costs of adaptation. Indications of nervousness on the  part of the US and others were detected in apparent attempts to  pre-empt any linkage between recent extreme weather events and  climate change, as well as in discussions on the Mauritius  Strategy. This is consistent with their stance at COP 10 and  subsequently at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction and at  the International Meeting on SIDS.

# CONCLUSION

### STORMS AHEAD - THE LONG RANGE WEATHER FORECAST

There were already signs of the jockeying and positioning that  will happen at Montreal, given that the process is about to enter  new and uncharted waters. Different Parties and negotiating groups  are entering this new phase with competing mandates regarding the  Convention and the Protocol.

The US seems determined to continue its engagement in the UNFCCC,  not to ratify Kyoto, and to keep a very careful eye on the  interaction between the two processes. This manifested itself at  SB 22 with carefully-crafted US statements and positions on  linkages with other processes, and their attitude on the budget  implications for the UNFCCC-Kyoto interface. Saudi Arabia and its  OPEC partners succeeded in ensuring that the discussion on  emissions from maritime transport and international aviation  barely left port, and expect to take center stage at the COP/MOP  debate on how to address the compliance mechanism issue. The EU's  position at the SOGE was based on a determination to keep the door  open for the further development of a post-2012 'formal process.'  The EU seems ever conscious of the sensitivities of the US and the  G-77/China, and Europe's own vocal business and industry lobby,  which has concerns about competitiveness. According to some, China  has stepped up its engagement in the process. Meanwhile, the  Canadian Presidency is expected to float possible trigger  strategies for the post-2012 discussion during bilateral and  multilateral discussions during the intersessional period, while  striking a balance between its relations with the US and EU. There  is little expectation that any agenda item introduced by Canada  will go beyond a discussion, for example at the High Level  segment, at this stage.

These and other issues will be in play in Montreal. The long range  weather forecast still points to extreme events.
