COP-6 Part II will aim to secure agreement on the operational  details for commitments on reducing emissions of greenhouse gases  under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Delegates will also seek to reach  agreement on actions to strengthen implementation of the UNFCCC  itself. The outcome of COP-6 Part II is seen as crucial in  furthering implementation of the UNFCCC and determining the future  status of the Protocol.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC

### INTRODUCTION TO THE UNFCCC

Climate change is considered one of  the most serious threats to the sustainability of the world's  environment, human health and well-being, and the global economy.  Mainstream scientists agree that the Earth's climate is being  affected by the build-up of greenhouse gases, such as carbon  dioxide, caused by human activities. Despite some lingering  uncertainties, a majority of scientists believe that precautionary  and prompt action is necessary.

The international response to climate change took shape with the  development of the UNFCCC. Adopted in 1992, the UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases at a level that would prevent  human-induced actions from leading to 'dangerous interference'  with the climate system. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March  1994. It now has 186 Parties. Six meetings of the Conference of  Parties (COP) have taken place, as well as numerous workshops and  meetings of the COP's subsidiary bodies.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate was established by COP-1 to reach agreement on a further  step in efforts to combat climate change. Following intense  negotiations at COP-3, held in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997,  delegates agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits  developed countries and countries making the transition to a  market economy to achieve quantified targets for decreasing their  emissions of greenhouse gases. These countries, known under the  UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to reducing their  overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least 5% below  1990 levels over the period between 2008 and 2012, with specific  targets varying from country to country. The Protocol also  provided the basis for three mechanisms to assist Annex I Parties  in meeting their national targets cost-effectively - an emissions  trading system, joint implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction  projects between Annex I Parties, and a Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) to encourage joint projects between Annex I and  non-Annex I (developing country) Parties. However, it was left for  subsequent meetings to decide on most of the rules and operational  details that will determine how these cuts in emissions are  achieved and how countries' efforts are measured and assessed.  Although some countries have signed the Protocol, most are waiting  until these operational details are negotiated before deciding  whether to ratify. To enter into force, the Protocol must be  ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, including Annex I Parties  representing at least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions  for 1990. To date, 34 Parties have ratified the Protocol.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

COP-4 met in Buenos Aires,  Argentina, in November 1998, to set out a work schedule for  reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and  for strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC itself. This work  schedule was outlined in a document called the Buenos Aires Plan  of Action. The critical deadline under the Plan of Action was COP- 6, where Parties were to attempt to reach agreement on a package  of issues. Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution  included rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing  Parties' compliance, and accounting methods for national emissions  and emissions reductions. Rules on crediting countries for carbon  sinks were also to be addressed. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the transfer  and development of technology, and assistance to those developing  countries that are especially vulnerable to the adverse effects of  climate change or to actions taken by industrialized countries to  combat climate change.

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP-6

Numerous formal and informal meetings and  consultations were held during 1999 and 2000 to help lay the  foundations for an agreement at COP-6. At the thirteenth sessions  of the subsidiary bodies - which began in September 2000 in Lyon,  France, and which were the final formal sessions before COP-6 -  political positions on the key issues remained entrenched, with  little indication of willingness to compromise or move forward.  While informal meetings and consultations held in October and  early November 2000 resulted in some further progress, many  differences remained.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the  Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000. During the second week of  negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk of the Netherlands  attempted to facilitate progress on the many disputed political  and technical issues by convening high-level informal Plenary  sessions to address the key political issues, which he grouped  into four 'clusters' or 'boxes,' as follows: (a) capacity  building, technology transfer, adverse effects and guidance to the  financial mechanism; (b) mechanisms; (c) land use, land-use change  and forestry (LULUCF); and, (d) compliance, policies and measures,  and accounting, reporting and review under UNFCCC Articles 5  (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8  (review of information). Ministers and other senior negotiators  convened in four groups to negotiate on these clusters in an  attempt to reach consensus.

However, by Thursday, 23 November, negotiations appeared stalled,  and President Pronk distributed a Note containing his proposals on  key issues in an attempt to encourage a breakthrough. After almost  36 hours of intense talks on the President's proposals,  negotiators could not achieve an agreement, with financial issues,  supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance and  LULUCF proving to be particular sticking points. On Saturday  afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk convened a final high- level informal Plenary in which he announced that delegates had  failed to reach agreement. Delegates agreed to suspend COP-6, and  expressed a willingness to resume their work in 2001.

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP-6 PART II

A number of meetings and  consultations have taken place since COP-6 Part I in an effort to  get negotiations back on track. Most recently, Informal High Level  Consultations chaired by President Pronk were held in  Scheveningen, the Netherlands, from 27-28 June 2001. Over 350  delegates from as many as 130 Parties participated, including a  number of ministers and deputy ministers. The aim of the  Consultations was to permit Parties to present to President Pronk  their views on his June consolidated negotiating text, which he  had presented as a tool to help negotiators reach a compromise. In  particular, Parties were encouraged to indicate whether these  texts constituted a balanced package with sufficient 'wins' for  all Parties, as well as to allow Parties to provide  recommendations regarding the organization of work during the  resumed COP-6.

While some participants expressed the opinion that positions did  not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I, others underscored  that positions had possibly widened. They also noted signs of  entrenchment by some Parties, in particular on the subjects of  LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and the use of nuclear power to meet  commitments. The funding issue also appeared to be a potential  barrier that could create problems. Further rumblings were caused  by Japan's ambiguity regarding its intentions for ratifying the  Protocol. Participants also expressed hope that President Pronk  would take a stronger leadership role, and provide more guidance,  rather than encouraging excessive discussion on difficult  subjects.

# COP-6 PART II

### RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

In March 2001, the US administration declared  its opposition to the Protocol, stating that it believed it to be  'fatally flawed', as it would damage its economy and exempted  developing countries from fully participating.

Since the US announcement, the EU has sent diplomatic missions to  several Parties, including Japan, Australia, Canada, the Russian  Federation and Iran, in an effort to maintain support for the  Protocol and its entry into force by 2002. In attempting to  persuade the US to alter its position, the UK, some other EU  countries and Japan have recently made attempts to demonstrate a  willingness to compromise by leaving the door open for a possible  amendment of the Protocol. One suggestion raised in early July by  President Pronk and others is a possible two-year delay to the  start of the first commitment period. The US has stated that it  will participate at COP-6 Part II in negotiations on the Protocol  in cases where talks might lead to outcomes affecting US trade, or  if negotiations could set precedents for other international  agreements. The US will be fully involved in all discussions  relating to their commitments under the UNFCCC.

### NEGOTIATING TEXTS

Negotiations will be held on the basis of  negotiating texts carried over from COP-6 Part I (see  FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.3, 'Part Three: Texts forwarded to resumed  sixth session by the COP at the first part of its 6th Session',  Volumes I - V). These texts cover all issues under negotiation,  although many paragraphs remain heavily bracketed.

In addition, an unbracketed consolidated negotiating text proposed  in June by President Pronk is likely to serve as a key 'tool' for  supporting the negotiations.  This text addresses critical areas  where disagreements remain, and attempts to establish a balanced  package of decisions on all issues covered by the Buenos Aires  Plan of Action. The text tackles questions related to finance,  technology transfer, adaptation, capacity-building, UNFCCC Article  4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects), the  mechanisms, LULUCF, compliance, and governance of new bodies.

Financial issues: The consolidated negotiating text deals with the  procedure for allocating resources to fund activities in non-Annex  I Parties. One key proposal in the text is that Annex I Parties  contribute US$ one billion annually by 2005 at the latest, based  on countries' relative share of total carbon dioxide emissions in  1990, with a 50% discount for countries making the transition to a  market economy.

Mechanisms: The consolidated negotiating text addresses  controversial issues such as supplementarity and eligibility to  participate in the mechanisms. The text also tackles the issue of  which LULUCF projects might be permitted under the CDM during the  first commitment period by suggesting that this should be limited  to afforestation and reforestation projects.

### LULUCF

The text outlines a complex 'compromise' package,  including text on accounting rules for eligible activities under  Protocol Article 3.4 (additional human activities such as forest  management and agricultural land management) that involve:  compensation of possible Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation  and deforestation) debits through accounting for forest management  of up to 8.2 megatons of carbon annually per Party, with no  discount applied to Article 3.4 credits up to this level; an 85  percent discount on forest management activities beyond the first  tier; and 'net-net accounting' for agricultural management.

Compliance: The consolidated text tackles issues such as the  respective roles of the enforcement and compliance branches, as  well as the legally binding consequences of non-compliance.
