# ELECTION PROCEDURES

In introducing the draft rules of procedures for the election of  the IPCC Bureau and any Task Force Bureau (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 5), IPCC  Secretary Christ recalled that delegates agreed to the content of  all rules at IPCC-24 except for Rule 20, the bracketed text of  which states that nominations for the IPCC Chair, the IPCC Bureau  and any Task Force Bureau are to be made by the government of a  member of the IPCC.

Emphasizing the IPCC's position as an intergovernmental  organization and that individuals must represent their own  countries, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION expressed support for removing  the brackets around Rule 20, as did others, including ARGENTINA,  AUSTRIA, SAUDIA ARABIA, FRANCE, the US, CHINA, and KENYA.  SWITZERLAND noted that the IPCC works on several levels in terms  of scientific and governmental representation and highlighted the  mobility of the scientific community. SRI LANKA suggested that the  interpretation of Rule 20 as understood by plenary, being that  individuals must be nominated by the government of their own  countries, should be recorded.

Delegates accepted Rule 20 as drafted and adopted the rules of  procedures with minor editorial changes.

# POLICY AND PROCESS FOR ADMITTING OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS

Referring to a revised proposal on a policy and process for  admitting observer organizations (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 7) and the summary  of information provided by organizations at the request of the  IPCC Secretariat (IPCC-XXV/INF. 2), IPCC Secretary Christ  suggested automatically accepting applications from organizations  that are already observers at the WMO, UNEP or UNFCCC. She stated  that observer organizations would be admitted to plenary sessions  but not invitation-only meetings and that organizations directly  established by a government cannot present themselves as NGOs.

The US, supported by AUSTRIA, suggested that the IPCC Bureau  should not have any formal decision making authority in approving  observer organizations. The UK and KENYA discussed the five year  timeframe for revision of observer organizations. MOROCCO,  supported by the UK, queried how an observer organization might  have its status revoked. AUSTRALIA suggested that admittance of  observer organizations be at the discretion of the IPCC Chair.  CHINA, echoed by SAUDI ARABIA and IRAQ, said it should be  necessary for applicants to first obtain approval from their  national governments. Discussion will continue in Friday's  plenary.

# TFI FUTURE WORK PROGRAMME

TFB Co-Chair Hiraishi presented the future work programme of the  TFI (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 10), noting, inter alia, the NGGIP's work on  the IPCC Emission Factor Database (EFDB) and its plan to develop  computer software that implements the Tier 1 methods of the 2006  Guidelines. He also referred to the NGGIP's plans to: prepare, as  part of its outreach activities, a brochure on the 2006 Guidelines  and answers to frequently asked questions; contribute to training  courses; and hold a meeting of inventory experts at the end of  2006 to develop a draft future work plan.

SWITZERLAND, with AUSTRIA and NORWAY, highlighted the importance  of reviewing how satellite and other remote sensing measurements  can contribute to national inventories. SAMOA welcomed the  development of software and called for support to Least Developed  Countries, in particular for setting up more effective data  collection and management systems. MALAWI and BENIN welcomed the  production of the brochure and other outreach activities, while  SYRIA, IRAN, GHANA, the GAMBIA, SIERRA LEONE, KENYA and others  stressed the importance of assistance to developing countries.

The NETHERLANDS and the US sought clarification on the proposed  brochure and called for broad participation in the expert meeting.  CHINA emphasized the need for balanced representation by developed  and developing countries. SPAIN highlighted the importance of the  EFDB.

Delegates agreed to the proposal for an inventory experts meeting,  taking into account comments raised during the discussion, and  that IPCC Chair Pachauri would write to the Government of Japan  thanking them for their support.

# 2006 GUIDELINES

Another lunchtime question and answer session with the  Coordinating Lead Authors was held to discuss technical aspects of  the 2006 Guidelines, during which TFB Co-Chair Hiraishi indicated  that certain revisions to sections of the 2006 Guidelines on  wetlands, absorption of carbon dioxide by concrete, and  spontaneous combustion had been made after contact group and  informal discussions.

After discussion by IPCC Chair Pachauri and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION  regarding the procedure for the acceptance of underlying material  and the purpose of the compilation of government comments (IPCC- XXV/Doc. 4b, Supp. 1), the Panel commenced consideration of the  Overview Chapter section by section. ARGENTINA, supported by SAUDI  ARABIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, and opposed by AUSTRIA, PERU,  SWITZERLAND and the US, suggested that methodologies be referred  to as revised methodologies.

In the evening session, Coordinating Lead Authors briefed  delegates on important revisions to the text based on government  comments (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 4b, Add.1). Delegates also discussed text  on, inter alia, multi-year averaging in the Agriculture, Forestry  and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, the relationship of the 2006  Guidelines to the EFDB, and the policy relevance of the 2006  Guidelines. After various editorial changes and revisions,  delegates adopted the Overview Chapter and accepted the 2006  Guidelines.

REVIEW OF the IPCC TERMS OF REFERENCE IPCC Secretary Christ introduced a background document on review  of the IPCC terms of reference (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 8), explaining that  at its 14th session in 2003, the WMO Congress encouraged the IPCC  to review the IPCC's terms of reference. KENYA suggested that a  review might include consideration of active work with the  scientific community in areas of comparative advantage and  capacity building in developing countries. Delegates discussed the  timing of a review, and MOROCCO, supported by NIGERIA, called for  the establishment of a working group to consider the issue. Noting  that the IPCC's terms of reference have served the organization  well, AUSTRALIA, with support from SWITZERLAND, the UK, CANADA,  NEW ZEALAND, GERMANY, PERU, and others suggested that a short-term  review by a small team working with the IPCC Chair might be  suitable. Chair Pachauri noted, and delegates agreed, that the  IPCC Secretariat would return to plenary by Friday with proposed  names for a small team to assist him with a review for  consideration at IPCC-26, which, if accepted, could be presented  to the WMO Congress.

# PROGRESS REPORTS

### Working Group I:

Susan Solomon (US), Working Group I Co-Chair,  presented on progress towards the AR4 (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 13). She  noted that the next IPCC Bureau should consider revising the IPCC  rules and procedures concerning reviews, given the emergence of  new electronic media.

###     Working Group II:

Presenting on progress towards the AR4 (IPCC- XXV/Doc. 15), Martin Parry (UK), Working Group II Co-Chair, agreed  that the IPCC rules and procedures should be reviewed but added  that the next IPCC Bureau should also consider the way in which  the Working Groups work with scientists in a sub-procedural  context. Delegates agreed that once the AR4 is completed, a small  group of IPCC members could develop a document to provide guidance  to the next IPCC Bureau on IPCC review procedures.

###     Working Group III

Working Group III Co-Chair Ogunlade Davidson  (Sierra Leone) presented on progress towards the AR4 (IPCC- XXV/Doc. 18), highlighting media attention on the IPCC Special  Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage.

###     AR4 Synthesis Report

Chair Pachauri informed the Panel that the  core writing team for the AR4 Synthesis Report (IPCC-XXV/INF. 5)  has been presented to the IPCC Bureau and that the first meeting  of the team will be held in approximately three months.

### TGICA

TGICA Co-Chair Jose Marengo (Brazil) provided a progress  report on TGICA (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 14), including an overview of its  11th session in Cape Town, South Africa from 7-9 February 2006.

### EFDB

TGICA Co-Chair Taka Hiraishi (Japan) updated the Panel on  the proposed membership of the EFDB Editorial Board (IPCC-XXV/Doc.  16).

# IPCC PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2006-09

In a morning session of the FTT, delegates considered input from  the Working Group TSUs and the TFI on their planned activities and  continued discussion of the large annual budgetary carryover, and  reasons for the discrepancies between forecasted and actual  expenditures. In an evening session, delegates discussed a draft  decision on the programme and budget for 2006-2009 proposed by the  Co-Chairs and the updated budget estimates for 2006 and 2007. A  revised draft decision will be available on Friday morning. The  FTT is scheduled to meet again in the early afternoon.

# EMISSIONS SCENARIOS

Morning and lunchtime contact groups, co-chaired by Ismail  Elgizouli (Sudan) and Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium), were  convened to discuss further work on new emissions scenarios.  Topics included the Co-Chairs' proposal to select a few, limited  benchmark emissions trajectories to be used for the next round of  scientific climate studies, the timing and funding for a technical  paper following the AR4, and a suggestion by the UK to create a  new task group. The US proposed that the Panel, inter alia,  reaffirm the IPCC's core function as scientific assessment,  catalyze the independent development of scenarios within the  climate modelling community, and request that the TGICA, in  coordination with the Co-Chairs of the Working Groups, organize a  meeting soon after the AR4 is completed to identify a list of  desirable and feasible characteristics to be developed by the  scenario development community to review information available for  new emissions scenarios.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Contact group discussions on the role of the IPCC in emissions  scenarios spilled out into the corridors on Thursday, with many  viewing this issue as a key indicator of the future direction and  role of the IPCC in the coming years. Different views among  participants were evident, with some delegates viewing the role of  the IPCC as one of coordination, while others said it should have  more of an assessment role. Regardless of which view eventually  emerges from discussions today, many delegates seem convinced that  this debate will continue to be a feature of IPCC meetings in the  future.

In light of a comment made in the emissions scenario contact group  that the IPCC must not be seen to be 'hopping into bed with the  climate modeling community,' delegates joked that the traffic in  Port Louis might not have been the only reason for the late  arrival of some participants to the meeting on Thursday morning.
