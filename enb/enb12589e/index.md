COLOMBIA, for Costa Rica, Panama and Peru, identified the need to move into more concrete work modalities as soon as possible to achieve a solid outcome under the ADP in Warsaw. Switzerland, for the EIG, stated that balance between workstreams 1 and 2 should not be used 'as a pretext to slow down' the negotiations.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

## DECISION-MAKING IN THE UNFCCC PROCESS (COP)

In the morning, open-ended informal consultations were held on decision-making in the UNFCCC process. Some parties sought reassurance that this issue would not be conflated with, or prejudge the outcome of, discussions on the rules of procedure; and the proposal from Papua New Guinea and Mexico to amend Convention Articles 7 and 18. Some parties emphasized the need to understand the meaning of 'consensus;' and to clarify the role of the presiding officer and the Secretariat. One party stressed the need for 'a clear legal environment, where we do not deviate from procedures that are not in force but yet applied'. Some parties highlighted that the rules of procedure have not been adopted because of lack of agreement on voting rules, and called for a forward-looking process, without re-opening past decisions. There was convergence on a party-driven process and the need to: respect the sovereignty of all parties; recognize that all have an opportunity to be heard; and ensure inclusiveness, legitimacy and transparency. Some parties emphasized the need to avoid taking decisions 'in the corridors or backrooms', citing COP 15 as an example. While there was some convergence on the timeliness of discussions to increase the effectiveness of negotiations, some expressed concern over 'sacrificing inclusiveness for effectiveness'. Others called for revisiting recent practices that have favored the adoption of decisions as 'a package'. Many questioned the way small negotiating groups are constituted, stressing that some parties with an interest in the issue may not get invited. On the outcome, some parties called for a COP 19 decision on decision-making in the UNFCCC process, while others underscored the need to keep the discussion open, without getting 'fixated' on a formal outcome. Informal consultations will continue.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

After many late nights of negotiations, the first week of the conference came to an end, with exhausted delegates leaving the venue early on Sunday morning. In their weariness, some delegates pondered the wider impact of all their work, and many expressed concern over some Annex I parties' low or reduced mitigation ambition. One delegate commented: 'we are supposed to be moving far and fast, but it feels as if we are moving backwards'. In the streets surrounding the venue, over 1.200 people participating in a Saturday afternoon march for climate justice shared the same sentiment, displaying banners calling for 'System Change, not Climate Change'. Some bleary-eyed delegates expressed hope that limited progress made this first week was only a warm up for the 'big game' in the second week when ministers arrive to 'flex their political muscles'.
