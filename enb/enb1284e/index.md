# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

The SBI met for progress reports from SBI and SBI/SBSTA contact  groups and other informal consultations. On amendments to  Annexes I and II, Ambassador Herrera (Venezuela) reported that  informal consultations regarding Turkey's status had not  resulted in consensus, and, supported by TURKEY, recommended  deferring the item to SBI-9, which was agreed.

José Romero (Switzerland) reported that the joint contact group  on allocation of work for COP/MOP-1 had deferred its second  meeting pending receipt of input from Parties and the joint  contact group on mechanisms. Tibor Faragó (Hungary) reported  that the contact group on implementation of FCCC Article 4.8 and  4.9 (adverse effects and impacts) was reviewing a compilation of  written inputs.

Jennifer Irish (Canada) reported that the contact group on  review of adequacy of Annex I commitments under Article 4.2(a)  and (b) had identified areas of convergence and divergence among  group members on the scope of review.

Dan Reifsnyder (US) reported that the contact group on non-Annex  I communications and the financial mechanism review appointed a  group of 'four non-G-77/China members and four non-Annex I  members' to recommend a decision for the contact group. One  question under discussion relates to translation and  dissemination. SBI Chair Kante noted the decision allowing NGO  observers access to contact groups if there is no objection from  any Party.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVICE

SBSTA opened with brief progress reports from the contact groups  on land use change and forestry and development and transfer of  technology, and from the joint contact groups on COP/MOP-1 and  mechanisms. The Chair called on Parties to exercise flexibility  on scientific and technical aspects of the issues since  political aspects will be dealt with by SBI. On education,  training and public awareness (FCCC Article 6) , the Chair  reported that the Secretariat and UNEP held a workshop on  Tuesday. The workshop highlighted the scope for cooperation on  public awareness and noted: that public awareness should not be  limited to particular events; the need for more effective  climate awareness strategies; and the need for Parties to  provide more information on particular awareness building  strategies.

UNEP reiterated the importance of public support in the  implementation of the Convention. SRI LANKA and IRAN called for  equal distribution of information packages prepared by CC:INFO  to countries beyond those included in country study programmes.  SWITZERLAND said that the existing information units of the  Secretariat and UNEP should be used to further the work under  Article 6 and, with the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC and IRAN,  called upon the IPCC to provide reports in languages other than  English.

The AFRICAN GROUP, GAMBIA and SRI LANKA called upon Parties to  make available resources for institutional capacity enhancement  and to expand the sphere of African countries participating in  country studies. She said that there was a need: to  operationalize Article 6; expand activities to all facets of  society and stressed that such activities are neither cheap nor  short term. To this end, she stated that the proposal to expand  the mandate of UNEP is worth considering. Supported by INDONESIA  and CANADA, she called upon SBSTA to request a Secretariat paper  on work under Article 6 for SBSTA-9. She recommended: that SBI  include a budget-line for the implementation of Article 6 in  their funding proposals as well as for translation of documents  to other languages; and noted the importance of timely delivery  of resources for the implementation of education programmes.

The US: noted the need to understand the drivers of change;  highlighted work of programmes such as the IGBP-START (Systems  for Analysis Research and Training); and noted the coordinating  role the Secretariat can play in North-South exchange of  experience. The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC and CANADA noted the  need for information and expertise sharing and a resource centre  for copyright-free material.

The EU called for a review of the scope of current education  programmes and the development of more specific reporting  guidelines. TOGO stressed that public awareness programmes  should not be based on political or economic considerations that  place the least developed countries on the periphery. The UK  distributed a national report that he hoped would be helpful to  others in developing their approaches.

# AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13

Chair Patrick Széll reported on the status of consultations  among three Parties on the group's report. On whether  representation within the Multilateral Consultative Committee  (MCC) should be equally divided between Annex I and non-Annex II  Parties or based on equitable regional distribution, delegates  had agreed to emphasize that 'some countries were of the view  that,' rather than 'one country suggested that,' the division be  50%-50% and that the 'G77/CHINA and some other countries' held  the other view. This depended on agreeing whether and how to  include 'equitable geographical distribution' in the MCP text  itself. A number of formulations had been rejected.

In the evening, the group addressing the Committee issue agreed  that the text would go forward to the COP with bracketed  language. AG13 will meet on Thursday to adopt the report of the  meeting.

# CONTACT GROUPS

## Land Use Change and Forestry

The contact group on land use  change and forestry removed few brackets from text regarding the  timing and content of the IPCC workshop, special report and TAR.  Delegates agreed to language noting that the purpose of the IPCC  workshop, to be held prior to COP-4, will be to consider data  availability, based on definitions used by Parties, in relation  to Article 3.3. BRAZIL and the EU preferred that SBSTA  'consider' a second workshop after COP-4 to focus on issues  arising from, inter alia, Article 3.4. The US preferred that  SBSTA 'hold' such a workshop.

On the timing of a special report, delegates disagreed on  whether the report would provide information for [COP-6] or [the  Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the  Parties]. A bracketed sentence was added, based on proposals  from CANADA and AUSTRALIA, stating that in the interim Parties  may wish to consider relevant issues, particularly 3.4.

Regarding the relevant Articles for consideration in the special  report, the EU and the MARSHALL ISLANDS preferred deleting  references to Articles 4 and 7 from a list including Articles  3.3, 3.4 and 3.7. The US said the list should mention all  relevant Articles and suggested 20 Articles for inclusion.  AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND disagreed with the EU proposal to  delete language stating that issues not covered in the special  report will be included in the TAR. The PHILIPPINES proposed  text to distinguish the topics for the special report from those  for inclusion in the TAR.

Adverse Effects and Impacts: The contact group on FCCC Articles  4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects and impacts) met in the afternoon  to discuss the Co-Chairs' text. The G-77/CHINA proposed  modifications based on its draft decision paper.

On the 'analytical framework,' the UK, AUSTRALIA, and the US  raised a number of questions. JAPAN cautioned that a reference  to Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 suggested implementation of  the Protocol. On separating the effects of climate change and  impacts of response measures, AUSTRALIA said different modeling  approaches are used. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by the UAE, said  the distinction could be made later. The G-77/CHINA proposed  alternative language from Decision 3/CP.3 on undertaking a  process.

The G-77/CHINA deleted reference to the Berlin Mandate. The US  bracketed references to Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14. On the  identification of 'possible' adverse effects and 'possible'  impacts, the US, supported by the EU, deleted references to  'possible'. On actions necessary to meet needs and concerns of  developing countries, the US and the EU proposed following FCCC  Article 4.8 on 'consideration' of actions necessary and on  'funding, insurance and the transfer of technology.' The G-77/CHINA, and VENEZUELA preferred 'identifying' actions. SAUDI  ARABIA placed 'identifying' and 'consideration' in brackets  together with the US-proposed reference to the FCCC. The EU  proposed combining paragraphs on identifying adverse effects and  impacts with those on the needs and concerns. The US added  'specific' needs and concerns.

Technology: The contact group on technology transfer considered  revised conclusions and debated proposals on next steps for  technology information centres. Under a proposal from the US and  the EU, the first step would be to assess the extent to which  managers and technicians in relevant sectors are aware of such  technologies and processes, followed by the identification of  sources and supplies. SBSTA would request the Secretariat to,  inter alia, identify the desired functions and services to be  provided by such centres and networks. Under a G-77/China  proposal, SBSTA would state that initial priority should be  given to supporting the establishment and enhancement of  national and regional technology information centres. The group  will meet Thursday.

Second Review of Adequacy of Commitments: a Co-Chairs' draft  decision, based on previous inputs, was distributed in the  contact group on second review of the adequacy of Article 4.2(a)  and (b), which then adjourned. The meeting was scheduled to  reconvene at 7:20 pm for questions and clarification.  Substantive views were expected on Thursday. The draft decision,  inter alia: initiates the second review at COP-4; offers two  alternatives on when future reviews should take place; and  requests the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis for COP-4.

Mechanisms: The joint contact group on mechanisms, chaired by  Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil), met to discuss a Co-Chairs' draft  proposed schedule on mechanisms under Kyoto Protocol Articles 6,  12 and 17 (projects for reducing emissions or enhancing sinks,  CDM, and emissions trading).

ARGENTINA recalled the address by Maria Julia Alsogary,  Argentina's Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable  Development, that there is a great interest, almost a consensus,  on the early functioning of the CDM and emissions trading.  Argentina, as the host of COP-4, has an obligation to work for  consensus and is in the process of consulting with all regional  groups, particularly the G-77/China and GRULAC.

The G-77/CHINA presented an initial list of issues to address,  and stressed consideration of fundamental issues before timing  and schedules of work. NORWAY, on behalf of a group of countries  and supported by the US, recalled a non-paper on emissions  trading distributed by the group last week, and the package of  four mechanisms agreed in Kyoto. He stressed that quantitative  caps, which could lead to fewer developing country projects, had  not been adopted in Kyoto. Referring to another non-paper, the  EU stressed domestic actions and called for: ceilings on use of  mechanisms; guidelines, rules and procedures; a compliance  regime as a pre-requisite; and parallel work on the mechanisms.  The US suggested basing group discussions on both the G77/China  questions and the Co-Chairs' draft proposed schedule.

In the evening, delegates received the G-77/CHINA's proposed  work programme on mechanisms. The proposal lists the  methodological and technical work, institutional issues, process  and linkages under CDM, Article 6 and emissions trading. The G-77/CHINA suggested deferring AIJ until after the pilot phase  designated at COP-1. The EU noted other linkages besides those  in the Co-Chairs' paper. Delegates began discussion on the G-77/China's listed issues. As of 11:00 pm, delegates had  discussed 17 items of the list.
