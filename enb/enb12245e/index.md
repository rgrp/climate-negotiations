# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme  (UNEP). The purpose of the IPCC is to assess the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding  the risks associated with human-induced climate change. The IPCC  does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor  climate-related data, but bases its assessments on published and  peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature. Its  Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is staffed by  both WMO and UNEP.

Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of  comprehensive assessments, special reports and technical papers,  providing scientific information on climate change to the  international community, including policymakers and the general  public. This information has played an important role in the  negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC, which provides the overall  global policy framework for addressing climate change, was adopted  in 1992 and entered into force in 1994.

The current structure of the IPCC includes three working groups:Working Group I addresses the scientific aspects of the  climate system and climate change; Working Group II addresses the vulnerability of socioeconomic  and natural systems to climate change, negative and positive  consequences of climate change, and options for adapting to it; and Working Group III addresses options for limiting greenhouse  gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change.

The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas  Inventories (TFI). The TFI oversees the IPCC National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories Programme (NGGIP), which aims to develop and  refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the  calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and  removals, and to encourage the use of this methodology by  countries participating in the IPCC and by UNFCCC signatories.

### KEY IPCC PRODUCTS

The IPCC completed its initial comprehensive  assessments of climate change in the First Assessment Report (FAR)  in 1990 and the Second Assessment Report (SAR) in 1995. In 1994,  it prepared technical guidelines for assessing greenhouse gas  inventories and subsequently revised these in 1996. The UNFCCC's  1997 Kyoto Protocol reaffirmed the use of the guidelines for  preparing national greenhouse gas inventories by Parties to the  UNFCCC and, in the future, by Parties to the Protocol.

The IPCC's Third Assessment Report (TAR) was completed by the  Panel in 2001. It addresses policy-relevant scientific, technical,  and socioeconomic dimensions of climate change. It concentrates on  findings since 1995 and pays attention to both regional and global  scales. The TAR is composed of a comprehensive assessment from the  three IPCC Working Groups, a summary for policymakers (SPM) and a  technical summary of each Working Group report, and a Synthesis  Report. The comprehensive assessments, Synthesis Report and SPMs  were subject to extensive peer review from experts and governments.  The TAR Synthesis Report is written in a non-technical style aimed  at policymakers and includes an SPM. It addresses nine  policy-relevant questions identified by the IPCC based on  submissions by governments.

### SEVENTEENTH SESSION

Discussions on the TAR concluded at IPCC-17  and IPCC-18. At IPCC-17, held from 4-6 April 2001, in Nairobi,  Kenya, participants accepted the actions of the three IPCC Working  Groups with regard to adopting their contributions to the TAR.  They considered progress on the TAR Synthesis Report, and discussed  in depth the future of the IPCC. Participants also approved the  preparation of a technical paper on the links between biological  diversity and climate change, and considered a proposal for a  special report on climate change and sustainable development.

### EIGHTEENTH SESSION

IPCC-18 was held from 24-29 September 2001, in  London, UK. Participants reviewed and adopted the TAR's SPM and  Synthesis Report and made decisions to: retain the IPCC's three  Working Groups, maintain the TFI, and keep the size of the IPCC  Bureau at 30 members; adopt the IPCC work programme and budget for  2002-2004; and endorse a scoping paper for the Technical Paper on  Climate Change and Biological Diversity and endorse in principle  the preparation of a technical paper on climate change and  sustainable development. They also accepted a work programme on  Good Practice Guidance on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry  (LULUCF), and authorized further work on developing definitions  for degradation and devegetation and the preparation of scoping  papers for work requested by the UNFCCC.

### NINETEENTH SESSION

Beginning at its nineteenth session, the IPCC  Plenary embarked on work towards the next assessment report. At  IPCC-19, held from 17-20 April 2002, in Geneva, participants  decided, inter alia, on a draft workplan for developing  definitions for degradation of forest and devegetation of other  vegetation types, methodological options to inventory and report  on emissions resulting from these activities, and elements of the  procedure for agreeing on NGGIP products. They also decided: on  the timing of the AR4; to hold a workshop on geological and  oceanic carbon separation, capture and storage; to draft a scoping  paper on climate change and water; and to hold an expert meeting  on climate change and development.

### TWENTIETH SESSION

IPCC-20 was held from 19-21 February 2003, in  Paris, France. Participants agreed on a work plan for two expert  'scoping meetings' on how to progress and structure the AR4 and  discussed a framework and set of criteria for establishing  priorities for special reports, methodology reports and technical  papers for the period of the fourth assessment. They also decided  to hold a high-level scientific meeting to survey the processes  affecting carbon stocks and human influences upon them and to  produce a special report on safeguarding the ozone layer and the  global climate system.

### TWENTY-FIRST SESSION

At IPCC-21, held from 3-7 November 2003, in  Vienna, Austria, participants reviewed the outlines of the proposed  Working Group contributions to the AR4 and the Chair's proposal for  a synthesis report for the AR4. They agreed that a technical paper  on climate change and water should be completed in 2007, discussed  terms of reference for a document on the AR4 product set, and  reviewed the report of the IPCC expert meeting on processes  affecting terrestrial carbon stocks and human influences upon them.  The Panel approved the terms of reference for the revision of the  Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories  and agreed on a revised mandate and name for the Task Group on  Scenarios for Climate and Impact Analysis (now TGICA).

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### CLIVAR/PAGES/IPCC WORKSHOP ON A 'MULTI-MILLENNIA PERSPECTIVE ON  DROUGHT AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE'

This workshop was held  from 18-21 November 2003, in Tucson, US, to discuss new ideas,  observations, analyses and theories about drought, and to  highlight ways of improving understanding, analysis approaches and  predictive capabilities. The focus of discussions was on North  America and Northern Africa using drought-related paleoclimatic  data and research.

### UNFCCC COP-9

The ninth Conference of the Parties (COP-9) to the  UNFCCC, was held from 1-12 December 2003, in Milan, Italy. Among  other things, Parties to the UNFCCC considered the IPCC TAR,  focusing on two agenda items, namely: scientific, technical, and  socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and  adaptation to, climate change; and scientific, technical and  socioeconomic aspects of mitigation. Discussions reflected  differing views on how to advance the agenda items. Parties  adopted conclusions requesting the UNFCCC Secretariat to organize  a workshop on each of the new agenda items during the twentieth  session of the UNFCCC's Subsidiary Body for Scientific and  Technological Advice (SBSTA). The COP requested SBSTA to report on  its work at COP-11.

### IPCC WORKSHOP ON DESCRIBING SCIENTIFIC UNCERTAINTIES IN CLIMATE  CHANGE TO SUPPORT ANALYSIS OF RISK AND OF OPTIONS

This workshop  was held from 11-13 May 2004, in Maynooth, Ireland, to discuss the  theme of 'uncertainty and risk.' Participants considered: examples  of how information on uncertainties is taken into account by users  of IPCC assessments; new developments in techniques for  characterizing and describing uncertainties; the extent to which  different techniques for dealing with uncertainty in different  disciplines can be harmonized in the AR4; and the treatment of  uncertainty in the TAR.

### TWENTIETH SESSIONS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BODIES TO THE UNFCCC

At  SB-20, held from 16-25 June 2004, in Bonn, Germany, the UNFCCC's  SBSTA held two in-session workshops to advance discussions on the  IPCC TAR findings. The first workshop addressed the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change. The second dealt  with the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of  mitigation. Parties then addressed these items in contact groups  and adopted conclusions on each agenda item.

### IPCC WORKING GROUP I WORKSHOP ON CLIMATE SENSITIVITY

This  workshop was held from 26-29 July 2004, in Paris, France.  Participants evaluated a range of climate model results to relate  different climate sensitivity estimates to differences in  descriptions of physical processes. They also reviewed  relationships between climate sensitivity and other model  features. Participants considered how current, historical and  paleoclimatic data can aid the determination of the likely range  of climate sensitivity and analyzed the interpretation and limits  of the climate sensitivity concept.

### IPCC EXPERT MEETING ON INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT, TRANSFER  AND DIFFUSION

At this meeting, held from 21-23 September 2004, in  Tokyo, Japan, participants discussed: key drivers of industrial  technology development, transfer, deployment and diffusion to be  addressed in the AR4; the conceptual framework of the assessment;  and access to industrial information networks relevant for the  scientific assessment of climate change mitigation and improving  the use of publicly available data sources from industry in the AR4.
