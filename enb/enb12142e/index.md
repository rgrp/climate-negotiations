These informal meetings, which are being held from 4-9  September in Lyon, France, immediately precede SB-13, which  will take place from 11-15 September. Delegates to SB-13  and the informal meetings will work toward fulfilling the  Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) adopted at the Fourth  Conference of the Parties in November 1998. Under the BAPA,  Parties set a two-year deadline for strengthening FCCC  implementation and preparing for the future entry into  force of the Kyoto Protocol. The Sixth Conference of the  Parties (COP-6), scheduled to take place from 13-24  November 2000, in The Hague, the Netherlands, will mark the  culmination of this two-year process.

SB-13 will aim to make progress on negotiations covering a  range of topics necessary for a comprehensive agreement to  be reached at COP-6, including: the Protocol mechanisms;  implementation of FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and matters  relating to Article 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol (adverse  effects); compliance under the Protocol; best practices in  policies and measures (P&Ms) among Parties included in  Annex I to the FCCC; LULUCF; guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5, 7 and 8; and the development and transfer of  technologies.

# INITIAL BRIEFING

Harald Dovland (Norway), Chair of the Subsidiary Body for  Scientific and Technological Advice, welcomed participants.  Noting that only 10 weeks remain before COP-6, he said this  week's meetings would aim to advance progress on text on  all issues. He observed that informal consultations and  meetings had been held since SB-12 on several key issues,  including: adverse effects, technology transfer, the  mechanisms, compliance, and LULUCF. In addition,  submissions from Parties had been received relating to  LULUCF, capacity building, and guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5, 7 and 8. He noted that these consultations and  submissions had assisted in the development of negotiating  text.

FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar thanked the  French government and city of Lyon for hosting SB-13. He  expressed regret at the passing away of two prominent  figures in climate change negotiations: Jean Ripert of  France, who chaired the Intergovernmental Negotiating  Committee that resulted in the adoption of the FCCC in  1992; and Shukong Zhong, Special Advisor on Environmental  Issues in China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. NIGERIA, on  behalf of the G-77/CHINA, conveyed the Group's condolences.  On logistical matters, he expressed concern at the late  availability and distribution of documents, which affected  developing country preparation and participation. He said  all official documents for COP-6 should be available well  in advance of the meeting. He noted that the lack of  interpretation would disadvantage representatives of non- English speaking countries and stressed the need to achieve  a balanced package of agreements that reflects the  priorities of all Parties.

# INFORMAL MEETINGS

### MECHANISMS

Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) introduced the  consolidated text on principles, modalities, rules and  guidelines on Mechanisms. INDIA, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, called for progress on other elements of the  BAPA, highlighted the need for conformity with the FCCC's  emphasis on equity and common but differentiated  responsibilities, and emphasized issues relating to the  nature and scope of the mechanisms and supplementarity.

The Secretariat gave a presentation on the proposed CDM  Reference Manual and on accreditation. He suggested that  the Manual would contain chapters on baseline  methodologies, monitoring, the project design document,  accreditation body requirements and Operational Entity  requirements. He said the Operational Entities could use  the Manual to understand, inter alia, the accreditation  criteria and process; validation, verification and  certification process; and approved methodologies to  validate/register project activities. On accreditation, he  outlined options for institutional arrangements, including  a single worldwide accreditation body, a  federation/association of accreditation bodies, and  mutual/multilateral recognition agreements. He identified  issues for consideration, such as the use of existing  accreditation structures, financing of accreditation bodies  and process, and appeal processes for designated  Operational Entities.

BRAZIL, with COLOMBIA, SOUTH AFRICA, CHINA and MOROCCO,  said decisions on baselines should be taken by a  politically-appointed body, such as the Executive Board.  SAUDI ARABIA highlighted the political nature of CDM- related decisions, urged that decisions on baselines be  undertaken by the COP/MOP, and expressed reservations about  the need for a Reference Manual. COLOMBIA noted the  possible tendency to exaggerate baselines, and urged  provision for the de-certification of Operational Entities.  CHINA, with the US, expressed preference for a single  worldwide accreditation body.

The REPUBLIC OF KOREA highlighted the issue of  additionality and questioned whether the Manual would be a  compilation of COP/MOP and Executive Board decisions, or  would include technical advice. The US supported the Manual  serving as a repository of decisions, while FRANCE, for the  EU, urged that it be of a technical nature. The US agreed  that decisions on baselines and related issues should be  made with the approval of the Board or an appointed expert  group serving under it.

SAUDI ARABIA and NORWAY cautioned against delaying  necessary decisions on the CDM. The EU suggested that the  role of the Board lies in the accreditation and random  checking of Operational Entities.

MOROCCO highlighted the interaction between the three  mechanisms. INDIA sought clarity on the nature of the  Certificate on Emissions Reductions. The PHILIPPINES  expressed concern with agreeing on the form of the  Reference Manual before agreeing on the substance of its  content. She sought clarity on the certification of project  activities and emissions reduction. MAURITANIA sought  clarity on the roles of the host country and the  Operational Entity, and stressed the need for the host  country to play the 'driving role' in the process.

In a further session on the mechanisms, the INTERNATIONAL  STANDARDS ORGANISATION, INTERNATIONAL ACCREDITATION FORUM  and DET NORSKE VERITAS outlined their views on  accreditation and conformity assessment. NGO  representatives highlighted the need to include public  participation in the CDM and JI, and to promote a 'positive  list' of non-contentious, credible renewable energy and  demand-side technologies for the CDM. Business  representatives stressed, inter alia, the need for non- bureaucratic mechanisms, and for translating environmental  objectives into business criteria

### GUIDELINES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Co-Chairs  Helen Plume (New Zealand) and Festus Luboyera (South  Africa) outlined the group's work, which includes  elaboration of guidelines under Articles 7 and 8, guidance  under Article 5.2 (adjustments) and four related draft  decisions. They stressed the need to focus on what can be  achieved prior to COP-6, noting that some issues will be  further elaborated at a later stage as they depend on the  work of other groups, such as on LULUCF, adverse effects  and the mechanisms. The US suggested starting with  guidelines under Article 7, as this would also progress  those under Article 8. The EU and US agreed to develop a  common text on Article 5.2 as a basis for further  negotiation.

Participants then began consideration of the draft  guidelines under Article 8. The EU said the expert review  team (ERT) should use relevant information to  'substantiate' rather than 'verify' information provided by  Annex I Parties. A number of participants preferred  replacing the term 'shall' with 'may' when referring to the  tasks of the ERT.

On the paragraphs addressing provision of additional  information to the ERT and confidentiality, the US,  proposed moving the two paragraphs to the section on review  of inventories, where they were more relevant. The EU said  the paragraphs were related to other guidelines and  preferred their inclusion in a general section. SAUDI  ARABIA, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, said the paragraphs  were applicable to all elements of reporting and should be  retained.

The EU proposed elaborating confidential information to  include 'confidential business or military information' as  referred to in similar paragraphs of the Montreal Protocol.  AUSTRALIA, with NEW ZEALAND, said that the Montreal  Protocol language may not be appropriate and preferred  referring to national security. NIGERIA asked whether any  confidential information would be given, as it was not  clear from the guidelines. The US said this issue should be  dealt with in the context of inventories and called for  procedures on how the ERT will deal with confidential data.

Regarding timeframes, the US said they should not be  aspirational deadlines but should be fixed and firm. The EU  proposed referring to review cycles, noting that there are  specific reviews that all require timeframes. SWITZERLAND  suggested defining a period of time in which the compliance  of a Party should be assessed.

### LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY

Co-Chair Halldor  Thorgeirsson (Iceland) summarized outcomes from the  workshop held in Poznan, Poland, in July, prior to the  deadline for Party submissions on LULUCF on 1 August. He  outlined the work programme for the informal consultations  and said he expected these to lead toward a negotiating  text. He asked delegates to: provide clarifications on  their submissions; highlight their priorities; and indicate  opportunities for streamlining ideas. BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed that he would not be prepared to discuss  LULUCF issues before Wednesday. He said the consultations  were moving beyond the mandated methodological issues, and  that a draft resolution could not be made on the basis of  the submissions. TUVALU underscored the need to consider  the data contained in the 1 August submissions, rather than  focusing solely on the synthesis of the textual proposals.

AUSTRALIA, with the US, supported working toward a draft  decision. Co-Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the consolidated  synthesis of proposals made by Parties on methodological  issues related to LULUCF that contains material on:  proposed definitions and accounting approaches related to  afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under  Article 3.3; how and which additional human-induced  activities might be included under Article 3.4 including  modalities, rules and guidelines related to these  activities and their accounting; methodologies for  measuring and reporting in relation to Article 3.3 and 3.4  activities; overall accounting approaches in relation to  the requirements of Article 3.3, 3.4 and 3.7;  reversibility, natural effects and accounting  interlinkages; and other issues. He explained that the  proposals had not been merged, simply organized under  descriptive headings.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

On an unremarkable opening day, a number of observers  suggested that delegates had made a comfortable if slow- paced start, resuming from where they had left-off at SB-12  and subsequent consultations. Several delegates expressed  concern at this apparent lack of urgency, given that COP-6  is now close. The strong position taken by the G-77/China  over logistical considerations that might impact developing  country participation caused some to question how much will  be achieved prior to COP-6.
