# OBSERVER BRIEFING

AGBM Chair Ra√∫l Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) stated that  negotiations are at an advanced stage and closed sessions  were necessary to produce results. He also recognized the  need to keep intergovernmental and non-governmental  observers informed and said morning briefings would be held  throughout the week.

Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil), Chair of the non-group on  QELROS, reported that delegates had been 'extremely  cooperative' and refrained from reiterating justifications  for their positions. The group focused on which greenhouse  gases (GHGs) to include in the agreement and whether to  adopt a gross or net approach. On coverage, he said  consensus is likely for including a list of gases and  expressed hope that discussions would produce a well- defined mechanism for adding more gases in the future. On  whether to adopt a gross or net approach, he said the group  would submit alternatives with and without carbon sinks. He  said the group would next consider units of emission, mass  per year and how to weight the contributions of each gas to  climate change.

Evans King (Trinidad and Tobago), Chair of the non-group on  Article 4.1, reported that the group had begun by  considering material in clusters and reorganizing material  in the chapeau, which refers to advancing the  implementation of commitments and the Berlin Mandate. He  said a solid foundation had been laid for work on the text,  and he would propose that the group complete a first  reading of the section to streamline the text.

Takao Shibata, Chair of the non-group on institutions,  mechanisms and final clauses expressed hope that his group  could build agreement on the issues that are somewhat  peripheral to the core issues under debate. A  representative from the International Chamber of Commerce  (ICC) protested the exclusion of NGOs from the non-group  sessions.

# NON-GROUP ON ARTICLE 4.1

The delegates continued negotiations on the draft text by  the non-group chair. Several paragraphs within the text  were deleted including those that called on Parties to:  recognize the progress that has been made on 4.1; reaffirm  their commitments to 4.1; and to develop further  international cooperation on the basis of mutually  beneficial incentive structures. One delegation called for  the preparation of national inventories on an annual basis.  Some non-Annex I countries opposed annual inventories  because of financial and technical limitations. Many  countries proposed the deletion of a paragraph calling for  cooperation to facilitate mitigation and adaptation to  climate change. Non-Annex I countries noted a strong  objection to the paragraph calling for specific definitions  on policies and measures. One delegate proposed that all  Parties under the Convention engage in transfer of  technology. Paragraphs noting the role that development and  transfer of technology should play and calling for entities  entrusted with operation of the financial mechanism to make  available financial assistance for the introduction of  technology were deleted.

On Saturday, 2 August, the non-group on Aritcle 4.1  continued discussing the Chair's text until 2:00 pm.The  Chair will produce a new text for further discussion that  will contain alternatives for articles lacking consensus.

# NON-GROUP ON QELROS

Interest was shown in the budget or multi-year approach  with the proviso that budget schedules begin promptly and  not extend over a long time period. On proposals for a  banking approach, some Parties suggested using limits on  borrowing to penalize non-compliance. Parties broached the  issue of whether the base year measurement should be fixed  or averaged. Flexibility in this regard was considered for  the economies in transition, as they would have most to  lose from averaging out a base year figure.

There was general support for a strong compliance regime  with penalty provisions. One Annex I Party reportedly  called for the use of 'review teams' of experts as opposed  to SBSTA. A penalty system of imposing percentage increases  in the required emissions reductions for non-compliance was  also raised. Others sought a shift away from penalties and  towards realizable targets. A proposal linking the annual  rate of GHG emissions to the increase in global mean  surface temperature was called into question when it was  suggested that this new modeling process would slow  progress.

On Saturday, 2 August, the non-group discussed, inter alia,  a compensation mechanism for the effects of response  measures.

# NON-GROUP ON INSTITUTIONS AND MECHANISMS

The Chair offered to produce a consolidated text to  facilitate discussion on numerous proposals on the table. A  discussion took place on the criteria for inclusion of  proposals. The Chair indicated that equivalent proposals  would be merged and those containing direct quotes from the  FCCC would be altered to include references to specific  FCCC articles. Regarding the subsidiary bodies and the  Secretariat, there was broad agreement that those serving  the Convention should also serve the Protocol.

There were differing views on whether the same Conference  of the Parties should serve the Convention and the  Protocol. There was a proposal whereby the COP would  operate for both instruments, but each of these would have  its own bureau. There was another proposal to establish a  Meeting of Parties to the protocol or legally binding  instrument. An FCCC provision stating that only the  protocol Parties shall take decisions under the protocol  was reiterated.

# SBI INFORMAL GROUPS

In an informal meeting, SBI heard reports from the chairs  of contact groups on outstanding issues. On review of the  financial mechanism, a contact group produced a text on 31  July that contains bracketed references noting the work  done by GEF since its inception and the initial concerns  raised so far by some non-Annex I Parties on their  experiences with the financial mechanism. In a section  welcoming the outcome of UNGASS, the text contains  bracketed references recognizing that implementation of  commitments made under international environmental treaties  can be promoted by: secure, sustained and predictable  financial support; sufficient institutional capacity; human  resources; and adequate access to technology.

A bracketed option states that SBI decides to appoint the  GEF as the financial mechanism of the Convention and shall  initiate arrangements for Parties to further consider GEF's  activities, including a method for Parties to raise issues  in the SBI with regard to the financial mechanism's  performance. A bracketed alternative would have SBI decide  that the GEF will continue as the financial mechanism on an  interim basis pending the review by COP-4. This text will  be annexed to SBI's draft conclusions, under which SBI  decided to defer consideration of this issue until its next  session. SBI urged all Parties to submit their views on the  financial mechanism no later than 8 September.

On national communications, an informal contact group will  meet again prior to SBI's final meeting on Tuesday. The  Chair's draft conclusions under consideration contain  proposed language under which SBI would: express concern at  the non-submission of communications by many Annex I  Parties; request a report on progress achieved in returning  emissions to 1990 levels and projected emission by 2000 by  each Party based on their national communication; and  request Annex II Parties to provide detailed information in  accordance with Article 12.3, which calls for information  on financial resources, adaptation assistance and  technology transfer.

A draft decision on division of labor between SBSTA and SBI  was approved. The decision outlines the general approach,  under which one of the bodies will take the overall  responsibility in considering an issue and will request  specific inputs from the other body. Where overall  responsibility is not assigned, agendas should be organized  to avoid SBSTA and SBI dealing with such issues in  parallel. Where this is not possible, consideration should  be given to holding ad hoc joint sessions.

SBI will have responsibility for developing guidelines on  the processes for consideration on national communications  and considering the information contained in national  communications and other relevant documentation. SBSTA, in  cooperation with SBI, shall have responsibility for  developing guidelines for the provision of comparable  information including all related methodological issues,  and shall consider national communications such as  technical papers, with the aim of, inter alia, verifying  methodologies used.

SBI will, with input from SBSTA, have responsibility for  assisting the COP in the assessment and review of the  effective implementation of the Convention with respect to  the development and transfer of technology. As stipulated  by the Convention, the SBSTA shall have responsibility for  providing advice on all scientific, technological and  methodological aspects.

SBI will have overall responsibility for all policy  questions and relevant inputs related to issues dealing  with NGO consultations, as appropriate. Should SBSTA or any  other subsidiary body conclude that NGOs could provide  relevant input on an item being considered, that body could  seek and consider such inputs. Issues involving provisional  accreditation related to individual NGOs will be the  responsibility of the relevant body.

On activities implemented jointly, SBSTA will have  responsibility for developing the framework for reporting,  including consideration of scientific, technical and  methodological aspects. SBSTA will also prepare a synthesis  report of activities for the COP. SBI will have the  responsibility for assisting the COP with reviewing the  progress of the activities implemented jointly under the  pilot phase, on the basis of inputs by SBSTA.

SBSTA will have overall responsibility for issues related  to research and systematic observation and shall play a  coordinating role in such activities related to  implementation. SBSTA will also have overall responsibility  for providing advice on education, training, public  awareness programmes and public access to information.

Delegates continued to debate draft conclusions on  arrangements for COP-3, particularly with regard to a  proposal that the Secretariat make all necessary  preparations for COP-3 to conduct the second review of the  adequacy of Article 4.2 (a) and (b) and the review of  Annexes I and II. Debate also centered on text describing  the dates of the high-level segment and noting that the COP  President will promote informal dialogue among ministers  and heads of delegations. On arrangements for COP-4, draft  conclusions contain bracketed alternative dates stating  that the COP will be held either in November 1998 or early  1999.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

An international business NGO used the first briefing for  observers to protest the decision to hold negotiations in  closed non-groups. Business representatives later indicated  that they would be discussing the matter with national  governments in the hope of reversing the decision in time  for AGBM-8 in October. While conceding the requirement for  closed negotiations in the latter stages of the process,  business representatives expressed dismay at the decision  to go into closed sessions when negotiating positions of  countries are well known.

An environmental NGO representative indicated that the AGBM  decision on access had been anticipated. Nevertheless,  there were concerns that a precedent has been set - one  that will not go unchallenged when NGOs next meet with the  AGBM Chair and Parties. To the suggestion that negotiations  might advance with more openness in closed sessions, an NGO  representative said there had been no evidence of this to  date.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

With non-groups working to cull down the number of  positions in working texts, delegates and observers noted  little movement on major issues in AGBM negotiations.  Discussions outside the non-groups aimed at developing  common positions among groups of countries have begun on  such issues as the commitments of non-Annex I countries and  the basis and form of emissions reductions. Some stated  that progress seems slow for this stage of the process,  while others commented that clearly defining options is  sufficient at this stage.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### AGBM

AGBM is expected to meet at 10:00 am in the Maritim  Room.
