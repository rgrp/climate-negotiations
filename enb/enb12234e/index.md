# SBSTA

## OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya)  opened SBSTA-20. Joke Waller-Hunter, UNFCCC Executive Secretary,  welcomed Turkey as the 189th UNFCCC Party. Delegates then adopted  the agenda.

## METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Good practice guidance (GPG) for LULUCF:  AUSTRALIA proposed an open-ended policy dialogue to ensure  coherence on accounting for LULUCF activities. BRAZIL urged  including factoring out in the dialogue, while the US preferred  not to engage in further recommendations on this matter. CANADA  and the EU said agreement on GPG and common reporting format  tables for reporting under the Protocol is a priority for  SBSTA-20. The EU called for consistency with current IPCC tables  and reporting recommendations. JAPAN highlighted the contribution  made by harvested wood products. BELIZE, for AOSIS, urged  concentrating on emissions rather than removals. Chair Benrageb  said William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Audun Rosland (Norway)  would co-chair a contact group on the issue.

###     Small-scale afforestation and reforestation (A&R) under the CDM

The EU said simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale  A&R are a means to facilitate local participation and reduce  transaction costs. PERU, with several Latin American Parties, said  that at US$ 6 per ton of CO2, small-scale A&R projects would not  benefit from CDM, given high transaction costs. BOLIVIA said that  such projects may be the only way to involve local and indigenous  peoples in 'proactive' climate action and urged innovative  procedures to advance projects.

CHINA, supported by BRAZIL and MALAYSIA, urged Parties not to  revisit definitions agreed on at COP-9. BANGLADESH said modalities  and procedures should be compatible with existing capacity and  expertise in developing countries. TUVALU, with BRAZIL, said that  CDM projects must be additional and not supported by official  development assistance. Chair Benrageb said Thelma Krug (Brazil)  would chair a contact group on the issue.

###     Greenhouse gas inventories

The IPCC Inventories Task Force Bureau  reported on progress in compiling the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for  Greenhouse Gas Inventories. KENYA emphasized that 'aggressive  mitigation' is required by Annex I Parties. NORWAY said the  greenhouse gas inventory review process is a capacity-building  activity beneficial to all Parties. Chair Benrageb said Helen  Plume (New Zealand) and Branca Americano (Brazil) would conduct  informal consultations on the matter.

###     Protocol Articles 7 and 8

The EU noted the importance of access  to all necessary information by expert review teams undertaking  annual reviews of greenhouse gas inventories, including that  deemed confidential by Parties. The US stressed the importance of  protecting confidential information. Chair Benrageb said the issue  would be addressed by the informal consultations on greenhouse gas  inventories.

###     Registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4

Chair Benrageb  invited Murray Ward (New Zealand) to conduct informal  consultations on the matter.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Expert Group on Technoloy Transfer (EGTT)  Chair Margaret Martin (Canada) reported on the fifth meeting of  the EGTT, held prior to SB-20. The G-77/CHINA called on SBSTA to  identify financial resources to address the needs identified in  the Technology Needs Assessments. The EU and JAPAN emphasized the  importance of private sector involvement. GHANA, for the Africa  Group, urged developed Parties to provide financial and technical  assistance. BELIZE, for AOSIS, emphasized the need for technology  transfer relevant to adaptation. Chair Benrageb said Andrej Kranjc  (Slovenia) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) would  co-chair a contact group on the issue.

### P&MS

The EU welcomed further opportunities to implement P&Ms.  Chair Benrageb said a contact group would be formed and co-chairs  would be announced following consultations.

### R&SO

The Global Climate Observing System Secretariat reported on  relevant work. JAPAN reported on the second Earth Observation  Summit held in Tokyo in April 2004. The AFRICA GROUP noted lack of  available funding to improve climate observation. CHINA urged  strengthening data exchange. WMO reported on its work on  increasing the number of climate observations. Chair Benrageb said  Stefan Rösner (Germany) and Sok Appadu (Mauritius) would co-chair  a contact group on this issue.

### COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The IPCC updated  participants on its work. The UNCCD reported on the workshop on  forests and forest ecosystems held in Viterbo, Italy, in April  2004. The RAMSAR CONVENTION expressed regret at not having been  invited to the recent Joint Liaison Group (JLG) meeting. FAO said  it will assume a more active role in climate change affairs. The  INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DISASTER REDUCTION said disaster  reduction remains relevant to climate change.

SWITZERLAND asked how involvement of CBD experts in the CDM EB can  be achieved, and suggested extending permanent observer status to  the Ramsar Convention in the JLG. PALAU noted the merit of  granting the Ramsar Convention full membership at the JLG. He  expressed concern that GEF encourages Parties to obtain funding  for adaptation from focal areas other than climate change. The US,  CANADA and AUSTRALIA emphasized coordination among national focal  points. Chair Benrageb said Outi Berghäll (Finland) and Marcela  Main (Chile) would facilitate informal consultations on the issue.

# SBI

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBI Chair Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria)  opened SBI-20. QATAR, for the G-77/China, requested SBI-20 to  consider arrangements for COP/MOP-1, given the possibility that  the Protocol will enter into force before the next session.  TUVALU, for AOSIS, emphasized the links between the UNFCCC and the  10-Year Review of the Barbados Programme of Action for the  Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. The EU  welcomed a recent statement by Russian President Vladimir Putin  in support of the Protocol.

Parties then adopted the SBI agenda as amended by the G-77/China.  The G-77/CHINA stressed the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities. The AFRICA GROUP highlighted the need to  increase funding for adaptation. On election of officers, Chair  Stoycheva said Fadel Lari (Kuwait) would continue to serve as  Vice-Chair of SBI, and Gonzalo Menéndez (Panama) would serve as  Rapporteur.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Submission of second, and  where appropriate, third national communications: Several  developing countries emphasized that the frequency of  communications depends on the availability of financial and  technical support. The US said developing countries should submit  national communications every four years, and greenhouse gas  inventories every two years, while LDCs should submit  communications every five years. SAMOA emphasized the importance  of avoiding duplication of work between the national communication  and NAPA processes, and, with BARBADOS, noted that none of the  projects proposed in their first national communications had been  funded. Chair Stoycheva said Sok Appadu (Mauritius) would chair a  contact group on the issue.

Work of the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national  communications (CGE): CGE Chair Brian Challenger (Antigua and  Barbuda) presented a report of the CGE meeting in May 2004. He  said the CGE would prioritize thematic hands-on training  workshops. SWITZERLAND said the effectiveness of these workshops  could be improved by, inter alia, identifying specific issues and  objectives in consultation with participating countries. Chair  Stoycheva said she would prepare draft conclusions on the issue.

###     Provision of financial and technical support

The EU welcomed the  information provided by the GEF on its support for the preparation  of initial national communications, and encouraged SBI to request  this information from the GEF for subsequent national  communications. Chair Stoycheva said she would draft conclusions  on the issue.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Matters relating to the implementation of  decision 5/CP.8 (review of the financial mechanism): AOSIS, with  others, cautioned that the COP's role in providing guidance to the  GEF is being 'undermined' by recent developments in the GEF  Council. ARGENTINA stressed the importance of accelerating the  financial needs assessment under the UNFCCC prior to discussions  on the next GEF replenishment. SWITZERLAND said the assessment  could not be conducted in time for the negotiations on the next  GEF replenishment. Chair Stoycheva requested Andrea Albán  (Colombia) and Sarah Hendry (UK) to hold information consultations  on the issue.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Budget performance for  biennium 2004-5: The Secretariat presented the status of  contributions to the UNFCCC core budget and trust funds. Chair  Stoycheva said she would prepare draft conclusions on the issue.

###     Financial support for participation in the UNFCCC process

The  Secretariat presented on the impacts of the practice of not  funding the participation of Parties whose contributions are  outstanding. Several SIDS urged financial support for two  participants from SIDS delegations. ARGENTINA and COLOMBIA said  outstanding contributions by developing countries should not be  interpreted as lack of willingness to pay.

###     Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement

Germany briefed  participants on progress in creating a UN campus for convention  secretariats based in Bonn.

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The EU expressed satisfaction  that the majority of Annex I reviews had been completed and posted  on the UNFCCC website. SBI took note of the issue.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Fatou Ndeye Gaye (the Gambia) reviewed the  outcomes of the African regional workshop on Article 6 held in  January 2004. UZBEKISTAN stressed the importance of inter-regional  cooperation on Article 6 and the need for a clearing-house.  URUGUAY and SAINT LUCIA encouraged holding workshops in other  regions. The EU announced a contribution of €35,000 to Article 6  activities. Chair Stoycheva said Markus Nauser (Switzerland) would  chair a contact group to prepare draft conclusions on the issue,  and consider input to further develop the clearing-house  originally planned as a pre-sessional event.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

TUVALU stressed the need to educate all  sections of society, including government ministries, on climate  change. The EU and JAPAN stressed country-driven approaches to  capacity building. TANZANIA, for the G-77/China, said  institutional capacity building had not yet been addressed. Chair  Stoycheva said Dechen Tsering (Bhutan) would chair a contact group  on the issue.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

Progress on the  implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7 (implementation  of Article 4.8 and 4.9): TUVALU encouraged examining progress on  implementation of the decision. Stressing that decision 5/CP.7  represents a milestone, the US noted the divergent views on the  success of the decision's implementation and urged finding common  ground. SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern about the lack of progress  in implementing the decision. The EU encouraged reviewing  progress, setting out key areas requiring further progress, and  negotiating and adopting a decision at COP-10. Chair Stoycheva  said Mohamed Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) and Paul  Watkinson (France) would co-chair a contact group on the issue.

###     Matters relating to LDCs

LDC Expert Group (LEG) Chair La'avasa  Malua (Samoa) reported on the meeting of the LEG in March 2004.  SWITZERLAND noted the relevance of the LEG's work to other UNFCCC  processes. He encouraged cooperation with the CGE, and cautioned  against duplication of work. GAMBIA offered to host the next LEG  meeting. UGANDA stressed the importance of the LEG. Chair  Stoycheva said she would draft conclusions on the issue.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While the corridors remained calm on day one, old controversies  were revisited in the Plenary halls. Discussions on non-Annex I  communications in the SBI evoked a feeling of déjà vu for at least  one delegate, and concerns were expressed that SBSTA negotiations  might get bogged down by the same old issue of forestry and land  use. At the same time, observers expressed uncertainty at the  potential shape or form of the brewing discussions on the  financial mechanism.
