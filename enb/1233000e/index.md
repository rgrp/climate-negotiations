# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

The Subsidiary Body on Implementation reconvened Friday  morning to further consider Agenda Item 3(a) (communications  from Annex I Parties). AOSIS regretted that only four Annex  I Parties will reach 1990 levels in light of the SAR.  Developed countries are playing a 'deadly losing game.' The  impact of the Communications Synthesis (FCCC/CP/1996/13) is  to discredit the initial goal in favor of limiting future  goals to whatever national economic circumstances permit.  The EU noted its concern that only six out of twenty-one in- depth review reports have been finalized. The US noted the  Secretariat's concern about time and resources needed for  in-depth reviews. It is imperative that second  communications be submitted by April 1997.

Under Agenda item 2(b) (guidelines for communications from  non-Annex I Parties), the Chair reported that a SBSTA  contact group is approaching consensus. The G-77/CHINA said  he has presented a position paper to the subsidiary bodies.  Draft decisions were approved on Agenda items 7(a)  (permanent secretariat) and 7(b) (income and budget  performance).

The meeting then turned to Agenda Item 5 (technology  transfer). The Secretariat introduced its reports, terms of  technology transfer (FCCC/CP/1996/11) and private sector  activities (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/4 - Add.2). The G-77/CHINA  highlighted Article 4.7 (technology transfer), suggesting a  meeting on technology adaptation. Supported by MALAYSIA, he  stated that Annex I data was not comparable to Annex II  data.

The EU, supported by the US, suggested the Secretariat focus  on voluntary private sector technology transfer and on  enabling conditions for its transfer. The US recommended  reporting this in Annex I communications. CHINA stated that  Annex II communications under-emphasize technology transfer.  BANGLADESH underlined the needs of LDCs. The MARSHALL  ISLANDS highlighted technology adaptation. CHINA and EGYPT  underscored a governmental role.

The Chair stated that he would confer with SBSTA to discuss  whether SBI should consider AIJ issues. The meeting  adjourned and a contact group on communication with the GEF  met, chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda). A contact  group on Annex I national communications also met, chaired  by John Drexhage (Canada).

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

The session considered proposals for  a protocol on policies and measures to implement FCCC.  Debate centered on the pros and cons of mandatory policies  and measures and their market driven alternatives. The US  said while Parties generally agree it is necessary to move  forward, no single set of policies and measures could apply  to all countries given diverging circumstances. He sought an  individual approach, noting the value of monitoring and  reporting. The EU stated that a coordinated/mandatory  approach would enhance progress by reducing participants'  opportunity costs. He suggested categorization of policy  measures and Party selection. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called  for categorization and prioritization.

EGYPT supported the establishment of lists from which  Parties could chose. INDIA said reduction targets must be  set before flexible policies and measures can be devised.  SAUDI ARABIA called for enhanced transparency and equity in  policy development.

The CZECH REPUBLIC sought assistance to countries with  economies in transition because their growth potential is  substantial. URUGUAY called for solidarity and noted that  the COP continues to 'discuss the sex of angels' while some  countries are suffering the effects of inaction. The SIERRA  CLUB stressed renewable energy projects rather than revenue  intensive ones, coordinated fuel standards for vehicles and  emissions targets. AUSTRALIA stated that the range of  measures must be comprehensive and cautioned against  selective sectoral processes in the absence of established  criteria. NORWAY stressed sustainable production and  consumption patterns and called on Parties to support  lifestyle changes. SAUDI ARABIA and IRAN supported a  cooperative approach, particularly in addressing economic  concerns, while the UK favored an individualistic one. KENYA  recommended that policies and measures be market-driven.

QELROs: An afternoon Round Table considered Quantified  Emissions Limitations and Reduction Objectives (QELROs) with  discussants from Germany, Japan, Samoa, the Russian  Federation, the Philippines, and ABARE Commodity Forecasting  and Economic Policy Research. Supporters of targets proposed  new GHG reduction targets of 10% to 20% by 2005, and 15-20%  by 2010, noted non-compliance with existing objectives by  developed countries, and suggested a purely cost-benefit  approach will lead to further inaction. Others questioned  the feasibility of a uniform reduction target or suggested  that the SAR demonstrates it is too early to judge limits  and levels of reduction without an assessment of costs and  benefits.

On the scientific or political basis of QELROs discussants  said negotiations are influenced and not determined by  science. The IPCC has left judgment to policy makers for  this reason. Others cited IPCC projections to suggest that  decision making is political and said everyday political or  economic decision making is based on incomplete information.

On legally binding objectives, discussants preferred, inter  alia<W0>, indicative targets with review mechanisms. On the  question of whether obligations to attain QELROs should be  single- or multi-party, discussants agreed that single party  obligations are the more realistic. There was also  substantial agreement that immediate action to reduce  emissions would lessen the magnitude of future corrections  necessary to stabilize the climate. A number of discussants  suggested setting 2005 as a short-term emissions target. One  NGO advocated a reduction scenario of 350 ppmv CO2 over a 50  year time scale, based on a correlation with violent storm  activity.

Considering differentiation among Annex I Parties, all  discussants agreed that recognizing differentiation and  equity was essential to achieving QELROs. One called for  flat rate reduction, however most recognized differentiated  effects on national economies as a result of climate policy.  Given the complexity of modelling these effects, one  discussant suggested having Parties establish baseline  emissions then calculate agreed percentage reductions on a  Party-by-Party basis. A proposal to combine the two  strategies, commencing with a flat rate reduction to meet  short term objectives, followed by a global emissions  trading regime, was met with some enthusiasm.

# PLENARY

The Plenary considered Agenda Item 3(b) (other statements).  IRAN announced its ratification of the FCCC. He said the SAR  confirms that it is not scientifically possible to link  climate change and GHGs. TURKEY explained that it had not  signed the FCCC because its status as a developed or  developing country is uncertain. SOUTH AFRICA said  ratification has been slow and it has begun an inventory of  internal emissions. UNIDO described technical assistance on  inventories of technology and support for a SBSTA workshop.

OPEC stated that the IPCC 'broke the rules' by implying  consensus among scientists in its conclusions. He called for  full compensation for any economic damage arising from the  implementation of the FCCC. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF  REGULATORY UTILITY COMMISSIONERS urged the Parties to  encourage participation of all stakeholders and proceed  cautiously on any new aims that would place undue cost  burdens on utility customers. BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR A  SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE suggested that Parties disseminate  information on energy efficiency, and consider new  approaches to emissions trading. A BUSINESS NGO  representative stated that business and industry involvement  and all-Party participation are critical to implementation.

A LOCAL AUTHORITIES representative said that local  authorities are taking action because they are seeing  drastic changes in weather patterns and rising disease.  CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK said the Parties should negotiate a  protocol containing a mechanism for progressively increasing  commitments. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK SOUTHEAST ASIA said COP- 2 should start negotiations on a protocol and reduce the  amount of resources spent on 'diversionary' issues like AIJ.  WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES said climate change represents an  ethical and spiritual challenge. The Plenary also considered  Agenda Item 9 (Special Session of the GA) and decided that  SBI-4 should make a contribution to the Special Session on  Agenda 21.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

The Chair presented the SBSTA and SBI Chairs' draft  recommendations on Agenda Item 5(d) (activities implemented  jointly). SAUDI ARABIA objected to the conclusion allowing  Parties to submit views on the reporting format by  September, noting this would be onerous for both developing  countries and the Secretariat. Several delegates including  BURKINA FASO, ARGENTINA, the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC and  KUWAIT noted that the text was available only in English and  asked that it be made available in French and at least one  other language before consideration. The Chair proposed that  the conclusions be reconsidered on Monday.

The Chair reported on Agenda Item 6 (development and  transfer of technology), noting that the issue is a shared  responsibility of SBSTA and SBI, and that SBI will continue  to take SBSTA's views on the subject through an open-ended  joint working group. Draft recommendations on Agenda Item  4(a) (Annex I communications) were also distributed and will  be considered on Monday when they are also available in  English. On the roster of experts, the G-77/CHINA noted the  need to include experts from developing countries and sought  full transparency. He said experts should be strictly  technical as opposed to political.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

NGO reaction varied to news that the Ministerial Round Table  will remain closed to observers and the press. Some business  NGOs expressed mild concern that the Round Table, which will  be opened to all heads of delegations regardless of rank,  will result in a de facto Plenary with no opportunity for  outside input. Many environmental NGOs said they had not  sought entry, in hopes a closed door session would produce  tangible progress. Some NGOs of both camps voiced concern on  setting a precedent.
