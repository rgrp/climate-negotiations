abstract: "On the opening day of the twelfth sessions of the FCCC  subsidiary bodies (SB-12), delegates met in a morning  session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and  Technological Advice (SBSTA) to discuss land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF), and guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information). The Subsidiary  Body for Implementation (SBI) considered Annex I and non- Annex I communications, the financial mechanism, and  administrative and financial matters. In the afternoon, a  joint SBI/SBSTA session addressed issues relating to  adverse effects, compliance and the mechanisms. Contact  groups were convened to continue consideration of LULUCF,  adverse effects, Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, and the  mechanisms."

# SBSTA

### LULUCF

IPCC Chair Robert Watson outlined the key issues in  the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF. Co-Chair Gwage noted the  capacity building function of the pre-sessional informal  meetings with regard to the LULUCF Special Report and  progress on the data format for submissions due on 1  August.

Several delegates called for sufficient time to consider  the Special Report. The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that  the 'sink' in Annex I countries would create an entitlement  to emit, and called for appropriate carbon accounting  approaches. COLOMBIA, opposed by SAMOA, supported equal  treatment of forestry in the CDM. The AFRICA GROUP  underscored links between land degradation and  sequestration.

AUSTRALIA and CANADA suggested dealing with Article 3.3  (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and 3.4  (additional activities) as a package. SWITZERLAND preferred  prioritizing Article 3.3, while the EU stressed emissions  reduction as the main emphasis when considering Article  3.4.

### GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE AND UNCERTAINTY MANAGEMENT IN  NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES

Taka Hiraishi, IPCC,  said the IPCC report on this topic was a significant  additional instrument in improving national inventory  estimates. The EU urged adoption at COP-6 of good practice  guidance as part of inventory reporting. GHANA called for  regional workshops to enhance developing country  understanding of the IPCC report.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Co-Chair Paciornik reported on the pre- sessional informal meeting and its outcomes. The US and  JAPAN recommended adoption of guidelines for national  systems at COP-6. The EU said some matters under Articles  5, 7 and 8 can only be completed after COP-6, as decisions  made on other issues need to be taken into consideration.  The G-77/CHINA said work on Articles 5, 7 and 8 should take  into account other Protocol articles, including those on  demonstrable progress, the financial mechanism and adverse  effects. On the linkage to the mechanisms, JAPAN proposed  that any Party should be able to use the mechanisms until  non-compliance with Articles 5 and/or 7 is proven.

# SBI

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates considered experiences  with the review of second national communications.  SWITZERLAND, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, underlined the  importance of training review experts, and proposed a  workshop to exchange information on the preparation of  third national communications. The EU said it expected a  decision on Protocol Article 7.2 (national communications)  at COP-6 and a decision on Protocol Article 8 (review of  information) at COP-7. The US and CANADA suggested  postponing consideration of the review of guidelines on  national communications until SB-14.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

SBI heard the first report of  the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE), which was  established to assist non-Annex I Parties improve their  national communications. CGE Chair José Gonzalez Miguez  (Brazil) said the CGE had at its first meeting agreed on a  schedule of meetings and activities, and prepared an  indicative budget. The EU, opposed by BRAZIL, the CENTRAL  AFRICAN REPUBLIC and KENYA, suggested that the CGE's  findings be presented by June 2001 to contribute to the  review of guidelines so as to adopt at COP-7 improved  guidelines for the second national communications. The US  urged the CGE to provide specific advice on the guidelines  and report on it at SB-14.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Several Parties highlighted the  importance of the GEF's support for the preparation of non- Annex I national communications and expressed appreciation  for the GEF Capacity Development Initiative (CDI). CANADA  supported the comprehensive approach in assessing capacity  development needs. The EU said the CDI should provide the  basis for a framework on capacity building, along with  national communications. The G-77/CHINA stressed the need  to link the CDI to the overall process under decision  10/CP.5 (capacity building in developing countries) to  avoid duplication. The IPCC outlined the GEF's proposal  entitled 'Assessment of Impacts of, and Adaptation to,  Climate Change in Multiple Regions and Sectors in  Coordination with the IPCC.'

### ADMINISTRATIVE & FINANCIAL MATTERS

FCCC Executive  Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar presented a document on  late payment of contributions. He suggested consideration  of the option that Parties with arrears of one year or more  could be ineligible to, inter alia: host a session of the  COP/Subsidiary Bodies; be invited to or receive funding to  attend informal meetings; or be allocated membership of the  Bureau of the COP or its subsidiary bodies. Several Parties  stressed the need for further exploration of the options  presented by the Executive Secretary. Informal  consultations will be held on this issue.

# JOINT SBI/SBSTA

SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) opened the meeting and called  on delegates to develop text on as many issues as possible  in accordance with the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. The G-77/CHINA stressed the need to negotiate the issues as a  package and said the outcome should be a balanced set of  decisions. He called on Annex II Parties to commit specific  financial resources for technology transfer and capacity  building by COP-6.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Chair Dovland reported on the recent  workshops and informal meetings on FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9  and Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects). The G-77/CHINA, with other non-Annex I Parties, advocated the  adoption of two draft decisions: one on Article 4.8 and 4.9  and another on Article 3.14. The EU, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, US  and SWITZERLAND preferred a single decision. AUSTRALIA,  with JAPAN and others, said the consolidated text was not  an appropriate basis for contact group discussion, and  proposed revisiting the compilation of Parties' views.

### COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Slade of the Joint Working Group on  Compliance (JWG) reported on the workshop held from 1-3  March 2000 and the informal meetings preceding SB-12. He  said that these, together with further submissions from  Parties, formed the basis for the negotiating text for SB- 12.

### MECHANISMS

Chair Chow reported on progress made during the  inter-sessional period and introduced relevant documents,  including the draft consolidated text on mechanisms. A  number of delegates said the new consolidated text formed a  useful basis or reference point from which to proceed. The  G-77/CHINA stressed the need to include rather than exclude  views, and to determine the nature of the process and terms  of reference for the contact group on mechanisms in the  lead-up to COP-6.

COLOMBIA said the CDM should: ensure sufficient  additionality; provide for equal treatment between the  three mechanisms; recognize the unilateral model for the  formulation of projects; and focus on prioritizing the  sustainable development aspect of CDM. ROMANIA, speaking  for the Group of Eastern European countries, and supported  by the US, said JI and CDM have distinct roles and should  not be treated in the same way. AUSTRALIA cautioned against  loading JI and CDM with transaction costs. CHILE supported  inclusion of sinks within the CDM.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### LULUCF

Delegates considered the Co-Chairs' note on draft  conclusions for SBSTA-12 relating to criteria and guiding  principles for identification and selection of additional  activities under Article 3.4. The EU called for inclusion  of further criteria and a guiding principle emphasizing  emissions reduction. AUSTRALIA disagreed, stressing the  importance of not being prescriptive, but allowing for  consideration of national circumstances. TUVALU and the G-77/CHINA proposed deleting reference to sustainable  development and to multilateral environmental agreements.  Some Parties suggested referring to specific articles, but  proceeded to agree on a general reference to the FCCC and  the Protocol.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Kjellén emphasized that the goal  of the contact group was to develop a proposal for  negotiating text for consideration at SBSTA-13. On  procedural issues, delegates differed over whether to  develop one or two draft decisions. SAUDI ARABIA and  several other developing countries, opposed by AUSTRALIA  and JAPAN, supported continuing work on the basis of the  Co-Chairs' consolidated text. SWITZERLAND said it was  premature to take a decision on long-term actions without  further research, information and a full assessment of  options, and said this process was moving too fast. Several  non-Annex I Parties expressed concern that this position  would make it difficult to move forward, and KUWAIT noted  that this could result in the whole package of issues being  blocked. NIGERIA said there was sufficient information to  take action, in spite of gaps. Co-Chair Kjellén said the  group should continue discussions to move forward based on  the consolidated text.

### MECHANISMS

Chair Chow introduced the draft consolidated  text on mechanisms. SAUDI ARABIA requested adjournment of  the meeting, noting the obstructive position of certain  Annex I Parties in the contact group on adverse effects,  and recalling the agreement struck on 9 June to use the  consolidated texts on adverse effects and on mechanisms as  the basis for negotiation. SWITZERLAND, supported by SAMOA,  CANADA and JAPAN, and opposed by BRAZIL and KUWAIT,  requested further discussion on the consolidated text.  Delegates resumed their deliberations and recommended,  inter alia: the development of a more concise text;  elaboration of the nature and scope of the mechanisms;  development of a participatory and transparent system that  engages the private sector; and clarity on dealing with  assigned amounts within each mechanism.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

This contact group reached agreement on  the second draft of the Guidelines for National Systems  under Protocol Article 5.1. The Secretariat introduced  SBSTA-12 draft Conclusions on Good Practice Guidance and  Uncertainty Management in National GHG Inventories. In  considering the Chairs' draft Conclusions on Guidelines  under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, delegates discussed,  inter alia, deadlines for the voluntary implementation of  the guidelines for national systems and for their possible  revision based on experience of Parties.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER AND DEVELOPMENT

The Friends of the  Chair group exchanged views on the themes for action  emerging from the regional consultative process.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The spirit of cooperation generated during the informal  meetings was shaken late Monday, when tensions in  negotiations in the contact group on adverse effects  spilled over into the mechanisms group in what many saw as  tit-for-tat reprisals. The apparent reluctance of some  Annex I Parties to discuss a consolidated text based on  Parties' proposals on adverse effects sparked a response in  the mechanisms group from Saudi Arabia, who sought to bring  the meeting to an abrupt halt. Several delegates observed  that the incident underlined the difficulties in moving  forward on a 'package' given some Parties' insistence on  simultaneous progress on all issues. Others also noted that  divisions within the G-77/China on adverse effects were  becoming more apparent by the day.
