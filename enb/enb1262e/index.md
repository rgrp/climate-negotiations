# AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE

AGBM Chair Raúl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) invited the  chairs of the non-groups to report on their progress.

Bo Kjéllen (Sweden) reported on the QELROs non-groups. He  said delegates in the non-group chaired by Luiz Gylvan  Meira Filho (Brazil) supported a revised Article 3(1) that  sets out the legally binding nature of commitments. Sinks  were a key emerging issue and further consultations are  forthcoming. The group decided that the non-group on  institutions and mechanisms should address issues  concerning the legal status of Attachment 1, which would  list differentiated commitments. Regarding Annex C (process  for establishing differentiated commitments), Parties  supporting differentiation will engage in informal  consultations.

Articles 3(3), specifying which Parties are committed, and  3(5), requiring demonstrable progress by 2005, are still  under consideration. Discussions on Article 3(6) - 3(12)  have been deferred, pending further discussions on  emissions budgets. Article 3(16) has been deferred until  Parties determine which gases to include. He said the AGBM  Chair requested SBTSA's assistance on methodologies and a  draft decision has been circulated. Delegates disagreed  over Global Warming Potentials (GWPs), and a contact group  will consider the issue.

On the second non-group, chaired by Kjéllen, he reported  broad agreement and a new text on 3(4) (countries with  economies in transition). On 3(13) and 3(14)(crediting),  amendments were suggested and further consideration will  await discussions on emissions budgets. On Articles 5  (emissions trading) and 6 (joint implementation), Kjéllen  reported wide differences of opinion. Informal  consultations were held on Saturday but some key  delegations did not participate. The Chair will produce a  revised text based on written submissions.

He said both QELROs groups have advanced slowly, but there  has been a useful exchange of views. He said that on many  issues the positions of some Parties are still far apart  and there is no evidence of emerging consensus. The agenda  for both segments is considerable and a number of things  must still be addressed, such as compliance and voluntary  commitments. He cautioned delegates to realize that all  elements are linked, and the purpose of this meeting is to  intensify the effort towards consensus.

Evans King (Trinidad and Tobago), Chair of the non-group on  advancing the commitments in FCCC Article 4.1 (Article 12  in the draft negotiating text), reported that delegates had  reached agreement on the chapeau, but have not discussed  all the sub-paragraphs. Discussions have proven that views  are divergent and delegates have not reached consensus. A  paragraph on implementation information will be set aside  pending resolution of related matters. On Article 13  (financial mechanism), he said delegates had exchanged  views and he is undertaking bilateral consultations.

Bakary Kante (Senegal), Chair of the non-group on policies  and measures (P&Ms), reported that the non-group had  addressed nearly all paragraphs contained in Article 2 and  Annex A of the negotiating text. He said 'last minute'  formulations had prevented consensus on a paragraph  requiring the adoption of P&Ms. The text currently contains  bracketed language under which Parties would adopt and  implement P&Ms towards the achievement of commitments of  QELROs. Alternative texts have been proposed both by the EU  and by the G-77 regarding a paragraph on minimizing the  adverse effects of P&Ms. A paragraph on sharing experiences  contains bracketed language on the development of common  methodologies. The EU said it could work with text proposed  by the G-77/China.

The AGBM Chair, for the Chair of the non-group on  institutions and mechanisms, reported that discussions had  begun on the preamble, but further consultations were  needed. Regarding definitions, the Secretariat will compile  a list of terms from the agreed text that need to be  defined. Article 14 contains alternative texts on  establishing a Meeting of the Parties (MOP) or having the  FCCC Conference of the Parties (COP) serve as the supreme  body. Delegates worked on the COP text and the Chair has  produced a revised text that takes into account views of  those who favored the MOP approach. The non-group has  discussed Articles 15 - 19, but has yet to consider  Articles 20 - 26.

The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested that Parties find  agreement on the quantitative parameters of the protocol,  expanding the 'bubble' concept to all Annex I Parties in  line with the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities. The commitments of individual Parties in  the bubble could be based on the proposed targets put  forward by those Parties. By 2010, an annual average  reduction of some 3% could be achieved. Commitments should  be achieved in absolute numbers rather than in percentage  terms. He suggested that any attempt to apply a single  criterion could give rise to a desire by some Parties to be  taken out of Annex I.

The UK, commenting on the Russian proposal, said that the  EU proposal for a 15% reduction in emissions was not  unilateral but dependent on similar efforts by others. He  conveyed a number of points from a Commonwealth Heads of  Government communiqué: the importance of a successful  outcome in Kyoto; a call on Parties at the COP to recognize  that all countries would need to play a part in pursuing  emissions reductions after Kyoto; and a call for monitoring  of commitments.

SAMOA, for AOSIS, said that US President Clinton's  announcement did not provide the leadership expected from  the world's wealthiest nation. The US commitment was not a  new commitment but an attempt to delay the achievement of a  goal that COP-1 had decided was inadequate. Climate change  risks demand action on the basis of the precautionary  principle not the wait-and-see approach. He urged President  Clinton not to defer responsibility for the duration of  some three presidential terms. EGYPT called for the  preparation of a unified text, indicating points of  agreement and disagreement, to take to the capitals Friday.

The EU, welcomed the fact that the US and Japan shared its  concerns and recognized the potential to reduce GHGs  through cost-effective domestic action, but added that this  was not properly reflected in the proposed targets. The US  figures were lower than Japan's already insufficient  targets. Serious negotiations would be needed if Kyoto is  to produce the outcome the world needs. The EU will seek  intensive dialogue with all Parties.

The US described its proposal as aggressive and pointed out  that some other proposals do not check the growth of trace  gases nor protect forests and soil sinks. The proposal was  fully compatible with long-term concentration targets that  have been put forward by other Parties, i.e. 550 ppmv.  Avoiding such concentrations would depend more on  developing countries' responses. No other Party was ready  to implement its domestic program so expeditiously, leading  others to propose unrealistic targets that fail to address  HFCs, PFCs and SF6. The US had also provided the most  detailed proposals for compliance. Promptly beginning the  process of agreeing on developing country commitments would  help them avoid the emissions-intensive path pursued by the  industrialized world.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

On arrangements for COP-3, FCCC Executive Secretary Michael  Zammit-Cutajar said discussions with the Japanese  government were on the verge of a successful conclusion. He  said that taking account the legal opinions and practices  of Japan's authorities, Japan's opinion on the legal  character of the COP and Convention Secretariat, and of  Japan's practice for security and police protection at UN  conferences, the international understanding for COP-3  would be an exchange of letters. He said the Secretariat  had sought and obtained a practical understanding to  produce the desired results without prejudicing these  views, and that the Secretariat's understanding should not  be considered a precedent for other meetings. Without  prejudice, the government of Japan will extend to  representatives of Parties and others involved in COP-3  such services, facilities, security privileges and immunity  as provided to other international and UN conferences in  Japan.

JAPAN acknowledged that it had virtually succeeded in  concluding issues with the Secretariat. He said the  government of Japan fully intends to provide the necessary  facilities to all functions and to ensure the COP is  conducted as smoothly as possible.

SBI Chair Mohammed Ould El-Ghaouth introduced a draft  decision to hold COP-4 in Bonn in November 1998 and  requesting that the Secretariat make necessary  arrangements. The decision was agreed. On the G-77/CHINA's  proposed agenda for COP-3's high-level segment, the Chair  said the segment would be organized with a traditional  first-come, first-served list of speakers. He said the G-77/CHINA proposal could be distributed as an official  document, although ministers customarily speak on national  issues, not on a requested list of topics. SAUDI ARABIA,  KUWAIT and CHINA requested that the proposal become an  official document.

# NON-GROUP ON ARTICLE 4.1

The non-group discussed a non-paper proposed by its Chair.  Delegates were unclear whether the AGBM Chair's  consolidated negotiating text remained the basis for  negotiations. A delegation indicated that agreement on an  initial paragraph containing a reference to the advancement  of commitments based on differentiated responsibilities and  national priorities would be contingent upon outcomes in  other areas. A group of countries said that advancement of  existing developing countries' commitments depends on the  provision of financial resources and transfer of  technology. Some delegates pointed out the lack of progress  in negotiations.

# NON-GROUP ON INSTITUTIONS AND MECHANISMS

The non-group on institutions and mechanisms discussed the  final articles of the draft negotiating text, including  those on ratification, regional economic integration  organizations, entry into force and withdrawal. A number of  substantive discussions were postponed until decisions  determining the overall shape of the protocol or other  legal instrument have been taken, and the group agreed to  reconvene for an evening session. On provisions for  regional economic integration organizations, most  participants felt that the issue should be deferred as it  is linked to the AGBM's acceptance of the 'bubble' concept  for meeting commitments. Negotiators concluded that a  decision on whether to link entry into force to the number  of ratifications alone or to a combination of ratifications  and carbon dioxide emissions covered should also be  postponed. One group supported entry into force after fifty  ratifications.

# NON-GROUP ON POLICIES AND MEASURES

Delegates received proposed text from a regional group and  from a group of industrialized countries, and debated which  paragraphs they were to consider. The Chair proposed  discussing paragraphs in a specific order. The regional  group sought to consider the entire article as a whole  because of newly proposed text in one subparagraph stating  that Parties will adopt P&Ms according to their priority  areas. The regional group's proposal divides the P&Ms into  three types; obligatory, intermediate and voluntary. The  Chair of a contact group reported that participants had  been unable to agree on revising a paragraph concerning  P&Ms in Annex A. The non-group met again in the evening.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Under pressure of time and, in some cases under fire, some  negotiators are reporting an increasingly fraught  atmosphere in Bonn. 'Between a rock and a hard place' was  how one participant summed up the position of negotiators  bound by and unable to draw back from highly publicized  negotiating positions. Suspicions about obstruction and  splitting tactics are being quietly aired. The only clear  target to emerge thus far has been the US position, which  has been fired on from all sides.
