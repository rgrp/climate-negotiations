# INFORMAL MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS

### MECHANISMS

Joint Implementation: BOLIVIA and SOUTH AFRICA  urged greater equilibrium between the rules relating to CDM  and JI. CANADA and JAPAN emphasized that JI is subject to  the rigor of guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.  CHINA suggested that JI be subject to CDM requirements, and  sought clarity on who should pay for this. The EU and  SWITZERLAND said their submissions on baselines for CDM  applied to JI. SOUTH AFRICA said its submission on  monitoring, reporting and verification for CDM also applied  to JI.

Clean Development Mechanism: BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, the US,  IRAN, HONDURAS and NORWAY supported the inclusion of sinks  projects in the CDM on the grounds that, inter alia: nearly  one-fifth of global emissions come from deforestation and  almost 90% of emissions from tropical countries are from  LULUCF activities. IRAN said that in light of the FCCC's  comprehensive approach, the CDM should cover all six gases,  and all sources and sinks. The EU and SWITZERLAND opposed  sinks projects in the CDM, as it raised questions of  methodological uncertainty, non-permanence and leakage. The  SUDAN and SENEGAL said it was premature to decide on the  inclusion of sinks, as the IPCC report had just been  released. AOSIS, with COLOMBIA, said Protocol Article 6  (JI) and 12 (CDM) should be given equal treatment in the  context of share of proceeds for adaptation, as this would  ensure real additional funds for adaptation, sufficient  funds for administrative costs, and no additional  transaction costs for the CDM. NORWAY and the EU opposed a  provision on share of proceeds in Articles 6 and 17  (Emissions Trading). BOLIVIA called for an analysis to  determine if project-by-project or regional/sectoral  baselines would be appropriate. INDIA supported project-by- project baselines. SWITZERLAND, the US and NORWAY  underscored the need for stakeholder participation and  transparency in the CDM. SAUDI ARABIA and AOSIS opposed  nuclear projects under CDM.

### GUIDELINES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Subgroup on  Articles 5.2 (adjustments) and 8 (review of information):  Delegates exchanged views on the Draft Guidelines under  Article 7. On information submitted under Article 7.1  (inventory) delegates, inter alia, stressed that  information through registries would be available more  frequently than annually, and highlighted linkages with  work on mechanisms and LULUCF. On information submitted  under Article 7.2 (national communication), the EU,  supported by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed reporting on  'demonstrable progress.'  The US, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND and  AUSTRALIA said this issue was not a priority for COP-6 and  could be dealt with through the forthcoming national  communications. When considering the Draft Guidance on  Methodologies for Adjustments, the EU, with SWITZERLAND and  SLOVAKIA, said the trial period on inventory review would  provide the IPCC with the information on problems to be  addressed. AUSTRALIA, the US, and NEW ZEALAND highlighted  the urgency of addressing adjustment methodologies, in  particular in relation to the base-year inventory.

On Classification of Inventory Problems in the Guidelines  under Article 8, delegates continued consideration of the  EU proposal. They agreed on the following steps:  identification of a failure to use agreed methodologies and  guidelines or to produce a timely report;  description/categorization of the problem; and  determination of whether or not the problem triggers, an  expedited procedure, or whether it is adjustable or not. On  adjustments, SLOVAKIA, the US, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA said  all inventory problems were adjustable, while the EU said  inventory problems of a specific threshold were not  adjustable.

Subgroup on Article 5.1 (national systems): Participants  discussed the second Draft Guidelines for National Systems  under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol. On Inventory  Management, CANADA noted the lack of reference to  confidential information, and JAPAN said the extent of, and  access to, confidential information is resolved under  Article 8. Delegates resolved the issue of reporting by  making reference to reporting requirements as they would be  defined in the guidelines under Article 7. The EU,  supported by NORWAY, proposed language on monitoring of  emissions of legal entities and/or projects under Articles  6 and 17. Co-Chair Plume said it was a reporting issue and  noted that relevant work on the mechanisms was still at an  early stage. The US opposed specific reference to Articles  6 and 17, and noted a paragraph leaving the door open for  future linking through Article 7 and relevant decisions by  the COP or COP/MOP.

### LULUCF

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson distributed a summary of  discussions on criteria and guiding principles for the  identification and selection of additional activities, and  a paper on possible elements for a draft decision. He said  delegates should prepare for COP-6 and beyond on the basis  of the information provided by the IPCC Special Report.

AOSIS, supported by several developing countries, expressed  concern that the informal meeting was going beyond the  mandate agreed at SBSTA-11 and, with the EU, objected to  the consideration of draft elements for a decision, noting  that many issues remain to be analyzed and discussed. Co- Chair Thorgeirsson explained that the proposed elements are  to serve as a vision of issues necessary to make a  decision. The US, CANADA and AUSTRALIA said the meeting's  tasks include preparing submissions due by 1 August 2000,  and in this context, discussing the elements of a draft  decision of COP-6 provides guidance. AUSTRALIA circulated a  paper with its proposals for issues to be considered in the  period before COP-6. On initial steps, he suggested a  dialogue with the IPCC lead authors to enhance the  understanding of the Special Report.

On the IPCC report, BOLIVIA noted the absence of concrete  definitions of terms such as 'forests,' which were relevant  to other Protocol Articles and, opposed by POLAND, proposed  developing one universal definition.

### COMPLIANCE

Delegates continued consideration of the Co- Chairs' Elements of a Compliance System for the Kyoto  Protocol. On Expedited Procedure for Cases Related to the  Kyoto Mechanisms, SOUTH AFRICA supported such a procedure  and, with CHINA, proposed the establishment of an  eligibility panel. With AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, the US said  the overall compliance procedure should be considered  before the expedited procedure. The EU, opposed by  AUSTRALIA, said there should be a pre-commitment review of  elements pertaining to participation in the mechanisms, and  an annual review during the commitment period. CHINA  cautioned the compliance group against prejudging the rules  that will be developed in the mechanisms group.

On Rules of Procedure for the Compliance Institution, the  US, with AUSTRALIA, the EU and CANADA, suggested focusing  on the elements needing agreement at COP-6, such as the  decision-making rule.  Delegates expressed diverging views  on the need for two sets of rules for the possible two  branches of the compliance institution.  On True-up Period,  delegates said the timing needed to be considered in  detail. The EU and the US suggested the end of the review.  AUSTRALIA proposed the end of the commitment period.

On Outcomes or Consequences of Non-Compliance or Potential  Non-Compliance, the EU said the consequences should create  a clear economic impact on that Party and aim at repairing  the overage. He added the concept of 'compliance reserve'  and, opposed by AUSTRALIA and CANADA, supported loss of  access to mechanisms. NEW ZEALAND opposed financial  penalties and, with AUSTRALIA, a compliance fund.  SOUTH  AFRICA, with the US, suggested creating a distinction  between various consequences based on the branch that would  deal with it. CHINA, with BRAZIL, opposed subtraction of  excess tonnes from a Party's assigned amount for the  subsequent commitment period. With SAUDI ARABIA, he  suggested adding a new title to the Elements addressing the  implications of Article 18 (non-compliance). SAUDI ARABIA  said financial penalties were the best way to proceed,  while CANADA queried how these could be enforced.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Kjellén circulated a compilation  of countries' preliminary written submissions on FCCC  Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14, and invited  comments on ways to proceed. Several Parties highlighted  the relatively rapid progress of negotiations on this  issue. SAUDI ARABIA said he expected a negotiating text for  separate draft decisions on FCCC 4.8 and 4.9, and on  Protocol Article 3.14, by Monday 12 June. The EU, CANADA  and others requested additional time to consider the  compilation. The US noted that negotiations on this issue  are keeping up with or ahead of other issues in the lead-up  to COP-6.

Co-Chair Kjellén said the aim was to consolidate the  document so as to work toward text for a decision at COP-6.  On its submissions on the adverse effects of climate  change, AUSTRALIA said his paper gives priority to:  capacity building; understanding the climate system;  vulnerability; linkages between science and policy; and  response measures relating to, inter alia, coastal and arid  zones, vulnerable high-risk areas, water resources, and  institutional strengthening. On the impacts of response  measures, SOUTH AFRICA said his country's aim was to  maintain its coal-driven low cost energy sector and energy  exports.

HONDURAS emphasized its vulnerability to landslides.  BURKINA FASO, for the AFRICA GROUP, underscored the  vulnerability of LDCs. On adaptation challenges, CANADA  highlighted: adopting an integrated and iterative approach;  building capacity for adaptation and assessment; and, with  the EU, improving information gathering and dissemination.   EGYPT proposed the establishment of a vulnerability index  for non-Annex I countries. With the US, he underlined the  importance of building developing country capacity on  vulnerability assessment.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some participants have expressed concern over what they  feel is undue haste in these meetings to produce the basis  for negotiating texts, such as in the LULUCF, mechanisms  and adverse effects groups. While they applaud progress,  they fear that the urgency in the lead-up to COP-6 means  negotiations may be pushed more rapidly than they are  prepared for at this stage. Indeed, some delegates sense  that these informal meetings have reached the limits of  their mandate.
