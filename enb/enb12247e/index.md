# SCOPE, CONTENT AND PROCESS FOR AN AR4 SYNTHESIS REPORT

Dahe Qin, Working Group I Co-Chair, emphasized the close connection  between timing and quality. Martin Manning, Working Group I  Technical Support Unit, outlined ingredients necessary to achieve  quality, including: allowing for flexibility in the selection of  authors, with careful consideration of expertise and availability;  and a fair and transparent review process. He recommended a  sequential writing process, noting that the Working Group I  schedule could be revised to prevent overlap with the Synthesis  Report preparation. Martin Parry, Working Group II Co-Chair,  favored a short Synthesis Report of about 30 pages, which would  draw specifically on the Working Groups' Summaries for  Policymakers, and develop some linkages not otherwise drawn to the  readers' attention. He suggested that work on the Synthesis Report  begin earlier, giving writers an opportunity to brainstorm about  key issues and monitor their development in the Working Group  Summaries for Policymakers.

Noting problems regarding differences in interpretation, MOLDOVA,  supported by FINLAND, CUBA, the NETHERLANDS, CZECH REPUBLIC and  others, said the Synthesis Report must be short and concise.  CANADA said it must indicate where there has been progress and  where uncertainties have been reduced since TAR. CUBA, COSTA RICA,  PERU and others emphasized that the Synthesis Report must use  inputs from the best experts with balanced geographic  representation and, with SRI LANKA, EL SALVADOR and others, said  cross-cutting themes should be integrated into the substance of  the report.

MALAYSIA and ROMANIA supported the topic, rather than question  format of the Synthesis Report. MALAYSIA and others stressed that  the Synthesis Report should not contain new information, and  reflect a true synthesis of the Working Group reports, as well as  the special reports. INDIA said adaptation and mitigation should  be addressed separately and, with NIGERIA, stressed the Synthesis  Report's importance, particularly for developing countries.  MAURITIUS and others highlighted the value of the Synthesis Report  in increasing public awareness.

The NETHERLANDS, with MEXICO, noted the need for overlap between  the Working Group and Synthesis Report writing processes to allow  re-examination by Working Groups of any inconsistencies identified  by the Synthesis Report process. The US said that work on the  Synthesis Report should not be initiated until completion of  expert reviews of the Working Group reports, including the  incorporation of comments into the reports. CHINA questioned the  Synthesis Report's added value and stated that if the Synthesis  Report is prepared, it should provide a full explanation of  uncertainties to avoid misleading policymakers. He proposed  establishing a contact group for further consultations.

MALAWI, UGANDA, the NETHERLANDS, SPAIN, PERU and others underscored  the need to produce the Synthesis Report by UNFCCC COP-13 in 2007.  The US expressed concern that time constraints would compromise the  preparation of a high quality report. BELGIUM said producing the  Synthesis Report by COP-13 need not compromise quality, and opposed  postponing delivery.

SPAIN, SWEDEN, ARGENTINA, KENYA, JAPAN and others supported taking  a decision on the Synthesis Report at this session. The US suggested  postponing the decision until the production schedule, scope and  content of the Synthesis Report have been adequately addressed.  SAUDI ARABIA stressed the importance of agreeing on the content and  substance of the report and of addressing the regional impacts of  mitigation measures.

Chair Pachauri established a contact group to examine content and  length of the Synthesis Report. The US, UK and CHINA suggested  that the group consider timing issues as well. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION recommended that the group consider the inclusion of  quantitative data in the Synthesis Report.

# AR4 PRODUCTS

IPCC Secretary Christ introduced a document on AR4 Products  (IPCC.XXII/Doc.6), noting that it reflected points raised by a  contact group convened at the 31st Session of the IPCC Bureau in  April 2004.

Several delegates supported the preparation of graphics for the  Synthesis Report and the Working Group reports, but SWITZERLAND  and BELGIUM questioned the estimated cost.

NEW ZEALAND stressed the importance of providing regionally  relevant information and datasets, and SAUDI ARABIA called for  addressing regional issues in the Working Group reports. Working  Group II Co-Chair Parry described two possible approaches for  indexing regional information. He explained that the first is  based on a content analysis of the final text, while the second  involves the authors making note of the topic and region concerned  by each reference in the report. For the latter option, he noted  the need to first discuss such an approach with authors. Not  opposing the use of regional centers to disseminate information,  SWITZERLAND stressed the need for integrity in the process of  selecting information to be disseminated. AUSTRALIA said  comprehensive indexing and cross-referencing of products enhances  the utility of the Working Group reports and underlined the value  of establishing an electronic search facility. CANADA stressed the  need to explore the feasibility of introducing an index, noting  that the IPCC is not the body to discuss how it is done. Jean  Palutikof, Working Group II Technical Support Unit, stated that  the AR4 process is too advanced to ask Lead Authors to index their  work, as their terms of reference have already been agreed.  GERMANY stressed the urgency of indexing regional information and  the need to make a decision on outreach at this session.

On making models, datasets, scenarios and visualization tools  available, the NETHERLANDS questioned labeling datasets or models  as 'IPCC approved,' but acknowledged the usefulness of making  available supporting materials for graphs, referring to similar  practices in science journals. DENMARK, with BELGIUM, called for  easy access to graphs and tables in the final report, and asked  that the translation of figure text be facilitated. Citing the  need for transparency and accountability, BELGIUM and DENMARK  called for making the simple model used to produce those graphics  available with its source code and parameters. BELGIUM said user  requirements for the technical papers must be determined.

# OUTREACH

John Stone, Outreach Task Group Co-Chair, reported on progress in  the Task Group, explaining that discussions had focused on the  fact sheets with broad agreement that they should be translated  into the six UN languages and formally sent to governments. He  noted that some participants suggested that fact sheets should be  produced as guides or roadmaps to new reports and other  participants proposed that fact sheets should include a statement  making it clear that the materials they contain are derived from  previously approved IPCC documents. He said the task group would  reconvene on Thursday.

IPCC Secretary Christ introduced the document on outreach  (IPCC-XXII/Doc.7), highlighting sections on interaction with the  media and on the distribution of IPCC publications.

Several countries stressed the urgent need for developing an  outreach strategy. CANADA called attention to meeting stakeholder  needs, and CHINA suggested that governments and research  institutions play an active role.  AUSTRALIA, supported by GERMANY,  called for examining the need for formal procedures. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION stressed the importance of raising awareness of IPCC  activities through the mass media. BELGIUM noted the need for an  outreach specialist in the Secretariat.

The NETHERLANDS, with the US, stressed the importance of reviewing  fact sheets. On producing a list of speakers, AUSTRIA and BELGIUM  said experts must be clear about the capacity in which they are  speaking. Stressing the need for improved outreach in his region,  IRAN, supported by AFGHANISTAN, proposed that the IPCC hold  workshops focusing on Asia and the Middle East.

SWITZERLAND and BELGIUM recommended exploring synergies with  activities taken under UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and  public awareness).

Working Group III Co-Chair Bert Metz warned against postponing a  decision on outreach, noting that two upcoming Special Reports  will be completed prior to IPCC-24.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### FINANCIAL TASK FORCE

This group, co-chaired by Marc Gillet, met  once in the morning and convened again in the evening. In the  morning, participants addressed options for enhancing the  flexibility of the budget to apply funding for unused journeys to  one meeting to support additional participants' travel to other  meetings. Participants also debated the necessity of an increased  budget for outreach.

In the evening, the Task Force continued to address the proposed  budget for 2005-8. In particular, participants debated at length  the feasibility of sponsoring Lead Authors' participation in  non-IPCC meetings, and discussed co-sponsoring workshops and the  existing IPCC provisions and past experiences with such matters.  Participants then turned to the draft decision on the  Secretariat's programme and budget for 2005-8, discussing how  and whether to reflect the annual carry-over amount of CHF 4  million, and the implications that this reference may have on  contributions by governments. Some supported defining clearly  the rationale for the carry-over.

### SCOPE, CONTENT AND PROCESS FOR AN AR4 SYNTHESIS REPORT

This  contact group, co-chaired by Geoff Love (Australia) and Ismail  Elgizouli (Sudan), met in afternoon and evening sessions. The  group discussed procedure, content, length and timing of the  Synthesis Report. On content, delegates stressed that listing  topics should not constrain authors but should instead provide  guidance, with some stating that the debate was preliminary and  that content should not be finalized at this time. Other issues  raised with respect to specific topics included proposals to,  inter alia: incorporate the concept of sustainable development in  the overarching principles; add a reference to costs and benefits;  integrate cross-cutting themes throughout the report; and include  a section on robust findings and key uncertainties. No consensus  was reached on the details of the topics to be addressed. On  length, many countries agreed that a report of approximately 30  pages would be appropriate, but disagreed on whether it should  also include a shorter Summary for Policymakers. On the timeline  for preparing the Synthesis Report, several participants were  concerned that the proposed timetable is too tight, noting in  particular that it calls for approval by the IPCC one week prior  to COP-13.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As discussions on the scope, timing, length and content of the  Synthesis Report continued to dominate the session on Wednesday,  mumblings were heard in the corridors regarding the rationale  behind proposals that would delay publication of the Synthesis  Report until after UNFCCC COP-13 in November 2007. According to  some, the desire to accommodate the  UNFCCC process was causing  unease, along with fears that the quality of the report may be  weakened by tight timelines. Others were more optimistic about  reaching consensus in New Delhi, noting that concerns about  quality could be addressed through careful time management.

The ENB summary report of IPCC-22 will be available on Saturday,  13 November, and can be accessed at  http://www.iisd.ca/climate/ipcc22/
