# SBSTA

Chair Thorgeirsson opened the sixth session of SBSTA-17, held in  the afternoon. On election of officers, delegates elected Arthur  Rolle (Bahamas) as SBSTA Vice-Chair and Tatyana Ososkova  (Uzbekistan) as SBSTA Rapporteur.

### IPCC TAR

Parties adopted conclusions with minor amendments on  consideration of how the TAR could facilitate the work of the  SBSTA (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.20).

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Review of methodological work: Harald  Dovland (Norway) reported on the informal consultations on this  issue and presented draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.17).  CHINA said he had been unable to take part in the consultations,  and proposed several substantive amendments. BANGLADESH, for the  G-77/CHINA, noted that the G-77/China had discussed the issues  internally and accepted these conclusions. A revised text was  agreed at the end of the SBSTA meeting, following informal  consultations.

###     Guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8

On guidelines under  Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information), Helen Plume (New  Zealand) reported that the contact group had completed its work,  bringing three years of negotiations on this issue to a close.  Murray Ward (New Zealand) reported on informal consultations on  guidelines under Article 7.4 (registries). The conclusions were  adopted and draft decisions forwarded to the COP  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.15 and Add. 1-3). BOLIVIA noted its reservation  with regard to identifying certified emission reductions (CERs)  acquired as a result of afforestation and reforestation under the  CDM separately from other CERs.

###     Guidelines on reporting and review of Annex I greenhouse gas  inventories

Parties adopted conclusions without amendment  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.16).

###     Activities implemented jointly

Parties adopted conclusions and a  draft COP-8 decision without amendment (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.21 and  Add.1).

###     LULUCF under the CDM

Thelma Krug (Brazil) reported on the contact  group. She drew attention to conclusions, noting, inter alia, an  options paper on sinks under CDM prepared by the Secretariat and a  workshop to be held in February 2003.

###     Special circumstances of Croatia

On the special circumstances of  Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6 (special circumstances of  economies in transition), Jim Penman (UK) reported on informal  consultations. SBSTA adopted draft conclusions which note that the  procedure used by Croatia to estimate its base year emissions is  neither consistent with IPCC Good Practice Guidance, nor with  UNFCCC reporting guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.14).

### ISSUES RELATING TO HYDROFLUOROCARBONS AND PERFLUOROCARBONS

On the  relationship between efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone  layer and to safeguard the global climate system, Richard Bradley  (US) reported on informal consultations. SBSTA adopted the draft  conclusions and agreed to forward a draft decision to the COP  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.19 and Add.1).

### COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

Jimena Nieto  (Columbia) reported on consultations. SBSTA adopted draft  conclusions noting the terms of reference for a workshop, and  agreed to transmit a draft decision to the COP  (FCCC/SBSTA2002/L.18 and Add.1).

### P&MS

Suk-Hoon Woo (Republic of Korea) reported on consultations,  noting that the group was unable to reach consensus.  SBSTA Chair  Thorgeirsson said that informal consultations on this issue were  also unsuccessful, noting that the G-77/China was concerned about  how Article 2.3 would be reflected in the conclusions. He  introduced draft conclusions that took note of the oral report and  other documents under consideration. SAUDI ARABIA said that there  was no agreement on these conclusions and proposed replacing all  paragraphs with text noting that SBSTA had not completed its  consideration of issues under this item, but agreed to continue  consideration at SBSTA-18. The EU proposed making reference to the  implementation of decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms). The conclusions were  adopted as amended (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.28).

### R&SO

Sue Barell (Australia) reported on the consultations. She  outlined draft conclusions, noting the need for strong  collaboration and coordinated approaches between research and  other bodies. The conclusions were adopted without amendment  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.27).

### OTHER MATTERS

Cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy:  Chair Thorgeirsson said that consultations on this issue did not  result in substantive conclusions. SBSTA adopted conclusions  deferring further consideration of the issue to SBSTA-18  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.25).

###     Implementation of Protocol Article 2.3

# SBI

Chair Estrada opened the session at 11:45 pm. The Secretariat  introduced the available draft conclusions. The SBI adopted  conclusions on arrangements for intergovernmental meetings for:  COP/MOP-1 (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.16 and Add.1); the date and venue of  COP-9 (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.10); and effective participation in the  UNFCCC process (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.13), recording that the EU did not  agree with the last conclusions as the text had not previously  been discussed.

Parties agreed on conclusions on Annex I national communications  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.9) and on administrative and financial matters  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.7). They decided to continue discussing the  request by the CACAM at the next SBI session, noting that the  CACAM can access GEF funding. It was also decided to continue  consideration of the Croatian proposal on LULUCF and its special  circumstances (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.11 and L.12). On capacity-building,  Parties made amendments to and adopted conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.15), soliciting Party submissions with a view to  reaffirming the current framework contained in two COP-7 decisions.

On implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9, SBI adopted conclusions  on progress in the implementation of activities under decision  5/CP.7 on adverse effects (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.17), and on matters  related to LDCs (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.8). It was agreed that the SB  Chairs and Secretariat would make arrangements for a meeting on  implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9, to be held back-to-back  with a workshop on cooperation with international organizations  agreed by the SBSTA. Chair Estrada adjourned the session due to  the late hour. The SBI will meet again at a time yet to be decided.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

SBI Chair Estrada convened the contact group  in the morning. On the report of the GEF, INDIA, opposed by the EU,  CANADA and SWITZERLAND, requested the deletion of text emphasizing  the 'successful and substantial third GEF replenishment.' On  behalf of the G-77/CHINA, he proposed text stressing the effective  operationalization of the recently established funds and the  greater effectiveness of existing funds. Parties could not agree  on the proposals.

On guidance to the Special Climate Change Fund, CANADA,  SWITZERLAND, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, and JAPAN supported using a  new text proposed by the EU as the basis for negotiations. INDIA,  for the G-77/CHINA, preferred using the Chair's text. CANADA, with  SWITZERLAND, stressed the prioritization of guidance to the Fund.  NORWAY and the EU underscored their support for operationalizing  the Fund, stressing the importance of identifying priorities and  following similar procedures used in establishing the Least  Developed Country (LDC) Fund. Parties could not agree on providing  guidance on the Special Climate Change Fund to the financial  mechanism for now, and agreed on an EU proposal to consider Party  submissions and discussions at SB-18 and a decision at COP-9.

On the LDC Fund, delegates discussed the Canadian proposal, noting  that it contained specific elements for the organization of four  regional workshops and the initiation of a dialogue on next steps  in the national adaptation programmes of action (NAPA)  implementation process. MALI requested Annex I Parties to consider  capacity-building for focal points and the implementation of NAPAs.  SAMOA stressed language on the complementarity of the Funds and  the operational guidance from the COP. Following informal  consultations, the draft decision on guidance to the LDC Fund was  agreed with minor additions. On the provision of additional  guidance to the GEF, several Parties requested this discussion be  delayed until guidance from the contact groups on capacity- building, technology transfer, UNFCCC Articles 4.8 & 4.9 (adverse  effects), and Article 6 could be received.

Regarding the review of the financial mechanism, the EU expressed  concern with moving forward on the basis of the Chair's draft  decision and distributed a new proposal. Parties could not agree  to an EU proposal requesting the Executive Secretary and the GEF  to explore synergies between the review processes of the UNFCCC  and the GEF, and deleted this paragraph. On additional guidance to  the operational entity of the financial mechanism, Chair Estrada  invited comments on matters related to capacity-building and  technology transfer. Parties could not agree to the elements in  the draft text.

### NON-ANNEX I ISSUES

Following informal consultations, Parties met  in the afternoon to discuss the improved guidelines for non-Annex  I national communications. Group Chair José Romero (Switzerland)  reminded delegates that unless agreement is reached on the  improved guidelines, the second national communications will be  prepared using current guidelines. Working through the text,  delegates debated the starting year of non-Annex I Parties'  greenhouse gas inventories, the frequency of the submissions, how  to address years where data is incomplete or missing, and  submissions by LDCs. Parties left text bracketed and turned to  emissions factors, disagreeing over reference to 'develop and use'  or just 'use' country-specific or regional emissions factors, with  some Parties preferring to retain reference to 'develop' in the  operational text, and others favoring placing this in the decision  text. Discussions continued late into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The corridors remained empty as delegates attempted to complete  their overloaded tasks late into the night prior to the arrival of  Ministers for a stock-taking session Wednesday afternoon. The  subdued mood in the corridors and the slow movement in the SB  sessions left several observers questioning the final form the  Delhi Declaration and its impact on the outstanding contentious  issues.
