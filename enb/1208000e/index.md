# WORKING GROUP I

In a debate punctuated by arguments among developing  countries, and between all delegates and the Chair, informal  consultations continued on the Co-Chairs' draft decisions on  the roles of the subsidiary bodies and the first review of  national communications The International Council for Local  Environmental Initiatives called for the inclusion of local  authorities and recommended that the COP establish a local  authorities' advisory committee with access to Convention.

AGENDA ITEM 7(e) - SUBSIDIARY BODIES: The Philippines, on  behalf of the G-77 and China, said that a majority of the  Group wished to delete 'of the in-depth review reports' from  the first bullet under 'Functions to be carried out by the  Subsidiary Body for Implementation....' The Chair noted this  was the first time he had heard a G-77 position expressed  when no consensus existed. The US, supported by Denmark,  France, Japan and Italy, preferred the existing language.  Uruguay added that a broad majority of developing countries  had agreed to retain the phrase. Senegal objected. China,  supporting the Philippines, said that an in-depth review is  not a Convention term and would require costly meetings. He  also cited a Greenpeace study calling current measures and  projections inadequate. The Co-Chair said he was embarrassed  that the lack of consensus within the G-77 had affected the  discussion, but the Philippines said G-77 members were  speaking their minds without malice. The Co-Chair  recommended retaining the language and referring the matter  to the COP. The Philippines, speaking only for his  delegation, and supported by China and Saudi Arabia,  suggested bracketing the phrase. The Chair noted that the  Rules of Procedure do not permit opening previous decisions,  and that Parties could refer to the matter in Plenary.  France, on behalf of the EU, and supported by the US,  Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK, agreed to revisit the  issue in Plenary, but opposed re-opening previous decisions.

The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, asked to  delete the reference to future protocols or amendments from  the last bullet on page 5, relating to the effects of steps  under current commitments. Denmark and Canada objected. The  Chair said the language should remain as is but could be  revisited by the COP. The Philippines asked that the Plenary  consider the decision.

The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, changed  the second to last bullet in Appendix I on providing  recommendations to the COP on responses to the review of the  adequacy of commitments and their implementation. France,  the Netherlands, Denmark, Switzerland, Canada and the US  objected. The Philippines asked that areas of disagreement  be noted.

In Appendix II, the G-77 and China added a paragraph before  the existing (a) to read: 'Stress to the IPCC the importance  of completing its second assessment report, which is  expected to address, on a scientific basis, both certainties  and uncertainties regarding the causes, effects, magnitudes,  and timing of climate change, in conformity with Article  4.1(g).' The US suggested the recommendation would be better  oriented toward the COP. The EU questioned whether the  paragraph would give improper political advice to the IPCC.  Uruguay said the proposal emphasized the scientific nature  of the IPCC, but that the authority of subsidiary bodies  over the IPCC needed to be clear. The Netherlands said the  IPCC should remain independent and not receive instructions  from the COP. China said the Convention's existence changes  the IPCC, and the IPCC has to respond to requests from the  Secretariat.

In Appendix III, the US added 'intergovernmental' to the  table wherever 'technical advisory panels' appears. He also  suggested adding a paragraph in Appendix II, section 1(e) to  hold a workshop, which would be open to all Parties and  interested non-governmental participants, on non- governmental advisory committees and/or a business  consultative mechanism in the January 1996 session of SBSTA.  The Philippines and China noted that developing countries  would need funding to attend.

The Philippines added two paragraphs under Appendix II,  paragraph 1(a). The Chair said the Philippines' language was  operational and has no place in this text. The Philippines  expressed resentment that he had not been allowed to finish.  The Chair said he was using his prerogatives to prevent  another embarrassment. The Philippines said that the two  paragraphs should be discussed.

After a recess, the Philippines apologized and read the two  paragraphs to add under Appendix 2(a): 'The detailed  description of their policies and measures to implement  their commitments under Article 4.2(a) and (b) in accordance  with Article 12.2 of the Convention' and 'the detailed  description of their policies and measures to implement  their commitments under Article 4.5 in accordance with  Article 12.3 of the Convention.' The UK, supported by  Denmark and the US, said the language would be more suitable  in the decision on national communications. The Chair  directed that paragraph 1(a) of Appendix II be written as a  separate decision and that the US and Philippines consult on  1(e).

After another break, delegates continued their review of  communications from Annex I Parties at 7:00 pm. In 1(a), the  EU said flexibility was possible on the date of the second  national communication but preferred not to set a precedent.  Hungary inserted 'revised' before 'guidelines' and added in  paragraph 5 'with a view to enhancing the comparability and  focus of communications,' which was amended further by the  Netherlands. The US suggestion 'with guidelines, revised as  appropriate' was accepted. In 1(b), the EU added a reference  to annual inventories, particularly on CO2. Uruguay  suggested submission of annual reports after 1997. Canada  supported the existing text. The US, supported by the UK,  asked whether it was possible to have a single submission  for inventory and communication reporting. Argentina added  reference to Annex I Parties that have not submitted  communications. In paragraph 7, the EU's reference to  collaboration between the Secretariat, non-Annex I Parties,  the GEF and the subsidiary bodies was rejected by the US.  The G-77 and China needed time to consult on paragraphs 7  and 8. In paragraph 9, the US questioned the financial  implications of transmission and distribution of  communications and preferred a more general reference.  Discussions were expected to continue.

# WORKING GROUP II

Working Group II addressed maintenance of interim  arrangements and guidance to the financial mechanism,  reporting by non-Annex I Parties, modalities and technology  transfer.

AGENDA ITEM 8(b) - MAINTENANCE OF INTERIM ARRANGEMENTS FOR  THE FINANCIAL MECHANISM: Delegates adopted  A/AC.237/WG.II/L.9, a draft decision submitted by the Co- Chairs to maintain interim arrangements with the GEF.

AGENDA ITEM 8(a)(i) - GUIDANCE TO THE FINANCIAL MECHANISM:  The Contact Group completed its negotiations on the first  four paragraphs of A/AC.237/Misc.41 on Monday. The text was  approved.

### COMMUNICATION OF INFORMATION FROM NON-ANNEX I PARTIES

Delegates then discussed the G-77/China paper on  communication of information by non-Annex I Parties  (A/AC.247/Misc.40). France, on behalf of the EU, proposed  that the Interim Secretariat, in cooperation with the GEF  Secretariat and interested non-Annex I Parties, draw up  guidelines for national communications by developing  countries to be endorsed at COP-1. The G-77 and China said  that there are varying capabilities among developing  countries and that it would be difficult to subject them to  a format. Germany suggested that provisional guidelines  could be adopted to guarantee comparability, with longer  term guidelines to be adopted at COP-2. Algeria said that  many developing countries need strengthened capacities to  gather statistics. The Chair noted that adoption of the  guidelines at COP-1 is too early, however, developing  country Parties have to submit communications within three  years of entry into force. Zaire has been gathering  information but needs a model for guidance. India suggested  renewing the developing countries' commitment to develop a  guidelines after COP-1. South Africa agreed with the UK that  countries should distribute a proposed national policy so  that the COP could work with it.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The Co-Chair then invited comments on  A/AC.237/Misc.41. The G-77, supported by China, Colombia and  Algeria, stated that the idea is to enable developing  countries, not to provide technology alone. Colombia  commented that this issue was a problem for other  conventions, none of which have agreed on the means of  implementation. China suggested that the Secretariat develop  an inventory of technology transferable at no cost, and  Algeria requested that the Secretariat develop practical  means for implementing technology transfer for COP-1. The EU  stated that institutional capacity building in developing  countries is crucial, and that technology transfer efforts  should concentrate on industry, agriculture and transport  sectors. WWF stressed that new initiatives should not  substitute for action in the industrialized countries and  the need for clear strategies.

AGENDA ITEM 8(a)(ii) - MODALITIES: The Co-Chair invited  comment on documents A/AC.237/87 and A/AC.237/WG.II/L.10,  the draft decision requesting the GEF Secretariat and  Convention Secretariat to draft an arrangement. The G-77 and  China stated a preference for a Memorandum of Understanding  (MOU) and proposed an amendment for paragraph 25 on amounts  of funding. The Co-Chair suggested inserting the phrase  'taking into account comments made by the G-77' into the  final draft paragraph.

### AGENDA ITEM 9 - PROVISION TO DEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTIES OF  TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT

The Co-Chair opened the  floor for comments on A/AC.237/90 and the addenda on the  Climate Convention cooperation programme (CC:COPE), the  joint training programme (CC:TRAIN) and the Climate Change  information exchange programme (CC:INFO). France, on behalf  of the EU, suggested that UNEP and UNITAR administer and  fund the programmes with oversight by the Secretariat. UNEP  commented it could not fund these programmes under its  current budget. The Philippines, on behalf of the G-77,  stressed the importance of these programmes in the success  of the Convention. Lithuania commented on the success of  CC:TRAIN in helping prepare its national communication and  for promoting ratification. The US requested detailed  documentation of programme spending and accomplishments.

# PLENARY

The Plenary met at 4:00 pm in an informal session to discuss  the Rules of Procedure. The Chair, T.P. Sreenivasan,  distributed two non-papers from Monday's drafting group. The  first contains the bracketed rules and the second one  contains new proposals. Rule 6 (Observers) and Rule 27  (Subsidiary Bodies) were accepted.

### RULE 4 - DATES OF SESSIONS

The drafting group submitted:  'The COP should endeavour not to hold such a session at a  time which would make the attendance of a significant number  of delegations difficult.' There was no agreement on  placement (in paragraph 2 or in a footnote). After Saudi  Arabia tried to reinstate language on sacred religious  holidays, delegates agreed to retain the compromise text in  paragraph 2.

### RULES 9-12 - AGENDA

In Rules 9, 10 and 11, the word 'draft'  was added before 'provisional agenda.' The Russian  Federation proposed deleting 'draft' from Rules 10 and 11  and reformulating Rule 9: 'In agreement with the President,  the secretariat shall draft the provisional agenda of each  session.' This was accepted. In Rule 12, delegates accepted  the language adapted from the Biodiversity Convention Rules  of Procedure.

### RULE 42 - VOTING

Delegates made little progress in  resolving differences over the number of votes needed to  adopt a protocol. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait insisted on a 3/4  majority vote. Trinidad and Tobago and others insisted on a  2/3 majority. The Chair put the entire Rule in brackets.

### RULE 54 - LANGUAGES

Japan proposed that the official  languages of the COP should be English, French and Spanish.  The Russian Federation and China objected and threatened to  bracket the entire document unless all six UN languages are  listed. The EU and Benin appealed to Japan not to insist,  but Japan stood firm. The Chair said that this would be  discussed by the Plenary.

### NEW PROPOSALS

The Chair announced that the Bureau had  agreed the informal group would not consider the new  proposals in Rule 22 (Officers) and Rule 27 (Subsidiary  Bodies). Venezuela, Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia protested  and insisted that their amendments be included in brackets.  The EU rejected these proposals. The Chair said that he  would announce in Plenary that new proposals were received  and are up for consideration.
