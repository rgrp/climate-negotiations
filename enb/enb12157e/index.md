# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

In an 'informal informal' meeting held during the afternoon,  delegates considered a revised Co-Chairs' text on procedures and  mechanisms relating to compliance. The group proceeded through the  text with the aim of ensuring that Parties' proposals were  adequately reflected. Participants did not enter into  negotiations.

Delegates then convened in a formal session of the Joint Working  Group (JWG). Co-Chair Dovland introduced the report of the JWG,  which includes annexed draft decisions, text on procedures and  mechanisms, and the text on final clauses. Delegates agreed to  this report. The G-77/CHINA expressed satisfaction with the  outcome of the JWG's work and said she would submit text on a  fourth option for the draft COP-6 decision. The EU said it had  submitted text to the Secretariat on the rates applicable for the  restoration of emissions under the compliance action plan and for  payments to be made to the compliance fund. Co-Chair Dovland said  the inputs received would be integrated into a new document  available Saturday, 18 November, for consideration by the joint  meeting of SBI/SBSTA. He concluded the final meeting of the JWG by  underlining that although delegates had hoped to have a clear text  as the JWG's end product, this had been challenging due to the  large number of difficult issues that had to be addressed. He  expressed his hope that the ministers would be able to resolve  these issues.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms)

Delegates discussed the draft  decision on P&Ms in two sessions of the contact group, and also  during informal consultations held throughout the day. In the  first contact group in the morning, discussions focused primarily  on revised text relating to the decision that future work on P&Ms  should facilitate an assessment of 'demonstrable progress' of  Annex I Parties in achieving their Protocol commitments. CANADA  argued that this issue is being examined in the contact group on  Articles 5, 7 and 8. With the support of JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the  US, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA and the EU, he proposed  replacing the decision and its associated initiatives with  alternative text stating that consideration of demonstrable  progress cannot take place until the SBSTA has considered the  issue pursuant to the guidelines that may be elaborated under  Article 7. Although opposing retention of the listed initiatives,  JAPAN, the US and AUSTRALIA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, also  provided amendments to the existing text in case it should be  retained, including: replacing text on the assessment of  demonstrable progress by 2005 with a request to Parties to  'continue sharing information'; replacing the requirement to  assess and minimize the adverse effects of P&Ms with a requirement  to facilitate information sharing on this issue; and bracketing  reference to the use of 'quantitative criteria' in reporting on  P&Ms in national communications.

On the preamble, the US and CANADA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA,  urged deleting text recalling UNFCCC Articles 4.1 (commitments for  all Parties), 4.2 (Annex I commitments), 4.8 (adverse effects) and  4.9 (least developed countries), and Protocol Articles 2 (P&Ms),  3.2 (demonstrable progress), 3.14 (adverse effects) and 7  (communication of information).  The EU proposed adding reference  to UNFCCC Article 7.2(b) (exchange of information on measures) and  7.2(c) (co-ordination of measures), and Protocol Articles 13.4(c)  (exchange of information on measures), 13.4(d) (co-ordination of  measures), and bracketed reference to UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9  (adverse effects), and Protocol Article 7.

Delegates supported the Co-Chair's proposal that the  implementation of P&Ms 'contributes to,' rather than 'is essential  to achieve,' the objectives of the UNFCCC and Protocol. In the  rest of the morning session, limited progress was made in removing  remaining bracketed text.

The contact group reconvened in the evening to consider revised  Co-Chairs' text that sought to provide for informal consultations  that occurred in the afternoon. On the preamble, the US, JAPAN and  CANADA, opposed by the EU, SAUDI ARABIA and SAMOA, again urged  deleting reference to specific UNFCCC and Protocol provisions.  These remained bracketed.

On the decision relating to demonstrable progress, Co-Chair  Muyungi (Tanzania) proposed presenting three broad options for  consideration next week. The US and AUSTRALIA underlined that  there were four possible options. SAUDI ARABIA urged the retention  of bracketed text, rather than presenting different options.  AUSTRALIA and the US, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and the EU, proposed  deleting chapeau language on an assessment of demonstrable  progress. Delegates failed to resolve the issue of whether to  present text on demonstrable progress in the form of options, or  as consolidated bracketed text.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates in this contact group  convened to continue consideration of the Co-Chairs' working paper  containing draft decisions under Articles 5, 7 and 8 as well as  draft guidelines under Articles 7 and 8. On the draft COP/MOP-1  decision related to Article 5.2 (adjustments), the US suggested  that adjustments applying to a Party's base-year inventory  estimates could not be replaced by revised estimates subsequent to  the establishment of a Party's initial assigned amounts. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU, said inventory estimates of a year  during the commitment period that had been adjusted should not be  revised and that consequently, adjustments of estimates of both  the base year inventory and the inventory during the commitment  period could not be revised.

On the guidelines under Article 8, delegates considered a US  proposal, supported by the EU, to move Part III bis on the annual  compilation and accounting of emission inventories and assigned  amounts (AA) to the Article 7 guidelines. Parties could not reach  agreement on this proposal, however. On a proposal by the G-77/CHINA to delete Part III on the review of information on AA,  the US said the guidelines should provide for review of  information related to AA. The EU, opposed by NEW ZEALAND, added  that if the information on the initial AA is put in the registries  by the Secretariat, instead of by the Parties, there is no need  for such a review. Co-Chair Paciornik informed delegates that the  mechanisms group had decided that issues relating to registries  had been allocated to the group on Articles 5, 7 and 8.

In discussions on the draft COP decision on Article 8, the G-77/CHINA and the US said text on the guidelines had first to be  finalized before attempting to remove brackets in the related  draft decision. Following the formal contact group session,  delegates convened throughout the afternoon and late into the  night in a meeting of the Friends of the Chairs, to continue  consideration of the Co-Chairs' working paper.

### LULUCF

In an afternoon meeting of the contact group, SWITZERLAND,  on behalf of the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, introduced their  proposed changes to the Co-Chairs' text, that would limit credits  for carbon sequestration due to windfall effects caused by, inter  alia, carbon dioxide fertilization, nitrogen deposition, age  structure effects of forests, and climate change. He said the  proposal involves the subtraction of a biome-specific threshold  value for windfall effects as well as a threshold value to account  for other uncertainties from any measured and verified sink  credits, and applies to all sinks under all relevant Protocol  Articles in all commitment periods.

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson then distributed a new Co-Chairs' text on  LULUCF, which he said was based on views expressed by delegates  over the past days, as well as on consultations the Co-Chairs had  held with representatives of groups of Parties. He introduced the  structure and content of the text, noting changes to, inter alia,  the proposed definition of 'forest,' and the preambular Principles  to the operative text. He said these had been replaced by two  paragraphs affirming consistency with environmental and social  principles, as little time remained for negotiating the preambular  material.

BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, said he could not accept the deletion  of the preambular Principles, and CHINA commented that too many  options had been eliminated from the text. The US, EU, TUVALU, and  PERU supported retention of the Principles. TUVALU, for AOSIS,  expressed concern that the group's suggestions, in particular one  regarding the biome approach to the definition of 'forest,' had  not been considered, and that the text as it stands was  unbalanced.

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson said the Co-Chairs would take into  consideration the views expressed by Parties, that the Principles  would be retained, and the work would proceed in the form of  closed Friends of the Chairs' consultations. In these subsequent  closed negotiations, delegates worked late into the night to  refine the text into a format that would be presented to the  ministers during the following week.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

This contact group met  briefly to report back on the progress made in 'informal informal'  meetings held on Wednesday. Co-Chair Afolabi noted that progress  has been made in the sections on capacity building, but that much  remains to be completed in the section on mechanisms for  technology transfer.

Delegates then adjourned into 'informal informal' consultations  where they discussed the Co-Chairs' proposals for a draft  decision. They bracketed additional text in the preambular  section, which includes language taken from the G-77/China  submission and from submissions by other Parties. Divergence  remains on references to the private sector, the role of  government and institutional arrangements. Consultations continued  late into the night. It was proposed that on completing  consideration of the draft decision, delegates will continue  working on the section on mechanisms for technology transfer in  the draft framework text.

### FINANCIAL ISSUES

Co-Chair Kerry Groves (Australia) welcomed  delegates to the first meeting of this group, which he said was  mandated by COP-6 President Pronk. He explained that the group had  been established in the light of the various funding proposals  being discussed in contact groups, and said this group would  provide input that would assist President Pronk in preparing  elements of a framework to integrate the various proposals. He  said the Co-Chairs of this group would report to President Pronk  on these consultations at 1:00 pm on Saturday, 18 November.  President Pronk would use this to help focus deliberations among  ministers and heads of delegation, scheduled to begin on Sunday,  19 November.

Co-Chair Groves then introduced a paper prepared by the  Secretariat listing the various proposals on funding arrangements  raised in the contact groups on capacity building, adverse effects  and technology transfer. He invited Parties to examine the paper  in order to identify what funding activities participants thought  might be undertaken by the GEF as an operating entity of the  financial mechanism of the UNFCCC, by the GEF as a 'motivator of  funds' outside its financial mechanism role, and by alternative  funding sources/mechanisms.

ARGENTINA, the G-77/CHINA and others expressed concern that this  group was not mandated by the COP-6 Bureau and was therefore not  established using the accepted process. In response, Co-Chair  Groves said President Pronk had been elected by the Conference of  the Parties and was therefore mandated to address issues in a  manner that would expedite progress. He noted that the outcome  would be a report by the Co-Chairs to President Pronk.

Regarding text on a framework for capacity building for developing  countries that refers to a special fund to support implementation  of this framework by the LDCs, the US said he believed that many  elements of this framework are relevant for GEF funding, although  some may not be. On draft text stating that Annex II Parties  should provide financial and technical resources for country-level  needs assessments and for the development of specific capacity  building activities consistent with the capacity building  framework, the EU indicated that at this stage it did not see the  need for a new fund outside of the GEF.

The G-77/CHINA, supported by COLOMBIA, BRAZIL, NIGERIA and others,  said it would not be able to participate in this discussion at  this time, as not all its issue convenors were available, and  sufficient time was needed to consider the whole issue in context.  Co-Chair Groves said it appeared that no further progress could be  made at this stage. He noted that a further meeting would be held  on Saturday morning, 18 November, and urged Parties to consider  the paper that had been presented.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

The contact group on capacity building in  developing countries met to consider the draft decision on  capacity building in developing countries and the annexed  framework for capacity building. Co-Chair Uosukainen introduced  the revised text resulting from 'informal informal' consultations  in the Friends of the Chairs' group. He said that the paragraphs  addressing financial provisions have been deferred to the contact  group on the financial mechanism. Delegates then considered the  paragraphs containing bracketed text and agreed to remove a number  of the brackets.

On the operational paragraph containing the purpose of the  framework, delegates agreed that the framework 'should' guide  capacity-building activities related to the implementation of the  UNFCCC. They also decided to delete a paragraph deciding to review  the framework after eight years and removed brackets from language  inviting Parties to provide information through national  communications to enable the SBI to monitor progress on the  implementation of the framework. They also agreed to recommend  COP/MOP-1 to adopt a decision containing a framework for capacity  building that reaffirms this framework with additional reference  to priority areas for capacity building relating to the  implementation of the Protocol.

In the scope for capacity building outlined in the annexed  framework, delegates debated and failed to remove brackets from  language on 'strengthening the capacity relating to'  'implementation' of adaptation response measures. They also did  not agree on reference to developing national adaptation  programmes of action, with the US stating that this was under  consideration in the contact group on adverse effects. On  financing and operation, divergence remained over whether  financial and technical resources should be made available through  an operating entity of the financial mechanism and 'as  appropriate,' multilateral and bilateral agencies.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

The Friends of the Chair group met throughout the  day to continue discussing the draft decision(s). The creation of  the financial issues group by President Pronk posed difficulty for  the G-77/CHINA, who held that the financial issues relating to the  decision(s) under UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article  3.14 should not be discussed separately from action outlined by  the decision(s). Compromise was reached on sections of text on  Article 3.14. However, key decisions, such as whether there should  be two separate decisions for Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Article 3.14  or one for both, remained unresolved.  Negotiations continued late  into the evening.

### MECHANISMS

Closed 'informal informal' discussions on mechanisms  were held throughout the day and late into the night with the aim  of seeking further convergence on the text. By late evening, it is  understood that while there had been steady progress in 'cleaning  up the text,' key decisions on many of the core issues have yet to  be taken. The contact group on mechanisms will meet on Saturday  morning to receive feedback on the informal discussions.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

SBI Chair Ashe opened the meeting of the  contact group on the financial mechanism. The group discussed the  revised Co-Chairs' text providing additional guidance to the  operating entity of the financial mechanism. He noted that  extensive 'informal informal' consultations had taken place during  the past few days, and that most of the text had been agreed. He  then invited delegates to consider the remaining bracketed  paragraphs. Delegates discussed at length two options for text of  a paragraph relating to the provision of GEF resources for  country-driven Stage II adaptation activities, particularly the  extent to which such activities would be based on national  communications. Parties could not agree whether such activities  should be in the context of/build upon national communications  'and' national studies, or national communications 'or' national  studies. The text remains in brackets.

The group discussed text on demonstration projects, which remained  bracketed. Delegates also discussed outstanding text requesting  the GEF to continue to provide financing, where appropriate, and  consistent with both the guidance of the COP and the GEF's  mandate, to support the implementation of the capacity building  framework, and to further support, enhance and implement the GEF's  capacity building activities in accordance with the framework.  However, the text remains bracketed. Delegates agreed that the Co- Chairs should work on integrating language in paragraphs on  reporting and on streamlining. Co-Chair Ashe said the text would  be presented to SBI on Saturday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Mixed reactions over the new group on financial issues mandated by  COP-6 President Pronk were expressed in the corridors Friday.  Whereas some welcomed the initiative as a useful move to help  focus attention on financial issues, several developing countries  expressed concerns at the procedure and problems of timing, given  the hectic schedule of informal meetings taking place. According  to observers, an underlying cause of sensitivity over talks on  funding mechanisms lies in differing views over the GEF, with some  developing countries pushing for alternative mechanisms. They  suggest this could be based partly on G-77/China hopes that  another mechanism would increase overall funding, an idea  apparently rejected by a number of developed country delegates. In  spite of these differences, however, there seems to be general  support for President Pronk's desire to encourage negotiators to  focus on funding issues ahead of deliberations by ministers and  heads of delegation starting Sunday.
