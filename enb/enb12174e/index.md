# PLENARY

Delegates convened in a delayed Plenary session late afternoon,  following intensive closed negotiations throughout the day between  President Pronk and various delegations to resolve outstanding  issues relating to the adoption of the political decision, and  organizational matters. President Pronk underlined that his role  is to safeguard the integrity of the political agreement reached  on Monday 23 July, guarantee a fair process, and encourage  delegates to work intensively on the basis of these agreements to  reach consensus on relevant decisions by Friday, 27 July.

### ADOPTION OF THE POLITICAL DECISION

President Pronk presented the  political decision on Implementation of the Buenos Aires Plan of  Action (BAPA) (FCCC/CP/2001/L.7) for formal adoption by the COP.  The decision was adopted.

The text of this decision is identical to that contained in the  proposal presented to the President's Group on Saturday 21 July at  11:00 pm, incorporating the text on procedures and mechanisms  relating to compliance that had been presented for adoption during  the High-Level Plenary on Monday 23 July. President Pronk noted  that there remain a number of inconsistencies to be addressed,  which are listed in two documents: the first (FCCC/CP/2001/CRP.9)  presents an inventory of editorial and technical amendments as  identified by the Secretariat, while the second  (FCCC/CP/2001/CRP.10) is a proposal by the Russian Federation to  include a footnote stating that the values allocated to the  Russian Federation for forest management are considered as  preliminary figures.

SAUDI ARABIA said these two documents are subject to negotiation,  and are not a part of what was adopted in the decision. He argued  that it would be unacceptable to re-open settled matters. The G-77/CHINA, supported by numerous member countries, as well as the  ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, CG-11, the EU, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA,  and the US, underlined the importance of safeguarding the  integrity of the political agreement reached on Monday. The EU and  SWITZERLAND requested that the joint Political Declaration on  finance be included in the conference report. JAPAN also requested  that note be taken of its statement on finance. SAUDI ARABIA,  AUSTRALIA and the US emphasized the need to rely on the text of  the UNFCCC and Protocol when there is any doubt with regard to the  political decision.

### ORGANIZATION OF WORK

President Pronk proposed that delegates  proceed with their remaining work in the previously established  negotiating groups on finance, LULUCF, mechanisms, compliance and  Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information). He proposed that work  commence with the first four groups. AUSTRALIA, CANADA and NEW  ZEALAND underlined the importance of Articles 5, 7, and 8, and  urged that this be addressed as soon as possible. Co-Chair Raul  Estrada of the mechanisms negotiating group noted that LULUCF in  the mechanisms would be addressed in the LULUCF group, and that  issues on the registries, which also affect Articles 5, 7 and 8,  would be addressed in the mechanisms group. CANADA expressed  concern with registries being 'extracted' from the package on  Articles 5, 7 and 8. President Pronk said these concerns will be  addressed by the Bureau Thursday.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### FINANCE

The negotiating group on finance met in the evening to  discuss a revised version of the informal paper on implementation  of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects). An Annex I Party  highlighted that the newly-adopted political decision on the  implementation of the BAPA contains sections that overlap with the  informal paper, and stressed that the decision was the definitive  document. Parties considered a proposal by one delegation on the  implementation of activities addressing adverse effects of climate  change to distinguish between activities supported by the GEF and  other bilateral and multilateral sources, and activities supported  by the Special Climate Change fund, the Adaptation fund, and other  bilateral and multilateral sources. Several Annex I Parties noted  that the proposal was aimed at providing clear guidance.  Developing countries said re-drafting the section would prove  complicated and time-consuming. Co-Chair Andrej Kranjc suggested  that a small drafting group be convened. This group met  immediately upon closure of the meeting of the negotiating group  in order to address the division of the activities into those  supported by the GEF and those supported by the Adaptation fund  and Special Climate Change fund.

### MECHANISMS

The mechanisms negotiating group, co-chaired by Raul  Estrada and Kok Kee Chow, met in the evening to hear feedback from  the two informal technical sub-groups established on Wednesday, 18  July, and to consider a consolidated text on the CDM. Murray Ward  (New Zealand), Chair of the informal sub-group on mechanisms'  eligibility and the verification procedures for track two of the  joint implementation projects, noted that some disagreement  remains, in particular on verification procedures. Chair of the  informal drafting sub-group on CDM technical issues, Jose Domingos  Gonzales Miguez (Brazil), reported that consensus had been  achieved on: baselines and additionality; small-scale CDM project  activities; environmental impact assessments; public  participation; and review by the Executive Board. Disagreement  remains on the transaction of CERs. Both groups were reconvened to  complete their negotiations.

Using an overhead projector, Co-Chairs Estrada and Chow then  presented a proposed consolidated text on the Modalities and  Procedures for a CDM incorporating The Hague text, the Pronk text,  the agreed results of the technical sub-group on the CDM, and text  from the political decision on implementation of the BAPA. A  number of Parties expressed concern with agreeing text on the  basis of overhead slides only, and requested printed copies of the  integrated text. Noting these concerns, the Co-Chairs presented  the text identifying the source of the various paragraphs. The  meeting was then adjourned to allow delegates to continue working  in the informal sub-groups.

Co-Chair Estrada underlined the need to work rapidly if agreement  is to be reached by Friday. Co-Chair Chow noted that informal  consultations will be held at a later stage on activities  implemented jointly, and requested Parties to provide input to him  on this matter.

### COMPLIANCE

Negotiating group Co-Chair Neroni Slade said the Co- Chairs had prepared a non-paper, under the authority of President  Pronk, that they hoped would assist delegates in their further  work. Introducing the non-paper, he highlighted from which  documents - the Pronk text, The Hague text, or the political  decision - its paragraphs had been drawn. He added that this  unified document constituted the 'natural product' of the  negotiating group's work. Co-Chair Slade then suspended the  meeting to allow regional groups and delegations to consider the  non-paper.

Following the resumption of the meeting, delegates gave their  initial reactions to the non-paper. Developing countries and many  developed countries welcomed it as providing a good basis for the  group's further work. One Annex I Party expressed concern about  the reflection, in the non-paper, of parts of the political  decision not included in the compliance section. With several  other Annex I Parties, she also questioned the accurate reflection  of the paragraph of this decision pertaining to the adoption of  procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance. A group of Annex  I Parties expressed some unease  over the modifications relating  to the facilitative branch, its relation to the enforcement branch  and the appeal procedure. This group also reminded participants of  the mandate given by the Ministers to complete their work by the  end of COP-6. Closing the meeting, Co-Chair Slade invited those  delegates in a position to do so, to provide, by midday Thursday,  drafting suggestions on how the political decision text could be  reflected in the non-paper.

### LULUCF

Co-Chair Harald Dovland informed delegates that the task  ahead for the negotiating group was the development of decisions  on LULUCF, and noted the limited time available. He stressed that  the decisions would reflect the political decision taken by  Ministers on Monday, 23 July, as well as the package of documents  previously discussed in the negotiating group. He suggested a  smaller group be convened to carry out the drafting work, based on  a new draft prepared by the Co-Chairs. Many Parties endorsed this  approach. Andreas Fischlin (Switzerland) and Halldor Thorgeirsson  (Iceland) were appointed as Co-Chairs of the drafting group. The  Secretariat distributed the Chairs' draft decisions concerning  LULUCF, containing language directly from the political decision  and additional legal text. The draft decisions comprise: a COP-6  decision; a COP/MOP-1 decision; an annex including definitions,  modalities, rules and guidelines related to LULUCF under the  Protocol; and an appendix including the maximum amount of Mt  C/year that Annex I Parties may receive credits for during the  first commitment period as a result of forest management under  Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities) and LULUCF activities  under joint implementation. The drafting group met late evening to  work on the document, and continued consultations into the night.

# INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

Delegates met in a contact group convened under the SBI to  consider the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003.  Participants engaged in a question-and-answer session on various  aspects of the programme budget, including: staffing requirements;  geographic representation of staff; the overall funding increase  being proposed; and the impact of decisions by the COP on the work  programme. Delegates also discussed spending priorities, with  developing countries highlighting technology transfer as one of  the key areas.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Participants spent many nervous hours Wednesday morning and  afternoon as disagreements over the political decision agreed on  Monday sent negotiators scrambling to patch up their differences.  Concerns about the substantive/political implications of some of  the technical and editorial changes made to the political decision  apparently resulted in some differences of views over which  version to put to the Plenary for formal adoption. Concerns also  related to the level of the Russian Federation's allocated cap on  forest management, with that country formally proposing that the  figures it had allocated were 'preliminary.' In addition, there  were also questions about the best way to proceed organizationally  with COP-6 Part II during its remaining days. However, these  issues appeared resolved by late afternoon, when the Plenary was  finally able to formally adopt the political decision and set out  its organization of work.

Late Wednesday, participants' attention had turned to the  negotiating groups, which resumed after the Plenary to begin  cleaning up the various texts. Some observers were suggesting that  negotiators would have their work cut out to finish this  'technical' work on the outstanding texts by the end of Friday.
