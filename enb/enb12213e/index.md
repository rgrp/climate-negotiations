# SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Chair Stoycheva said Parties agreed to  consider the issue of non-Annex I national communications under  other matters, and the SBI adopted the agenda without amendment.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Parties heard remaining  statements on the programme and budget for the biennium 2004-2005.  JAPAN said conference services should be funded from the UN  regular budget. The EU indicated that the budget should be more  predictable and sustainable for future periods, and expressed  surprise over the distinction between the Protocol and UNFCCC  activities in the budget. AUSTRALIA emphasized that budget  priorities need to be clarified, and, with BRAZIL, CHINA, the EU,  JAPAN, NORWAY, and RUSSIAN FEDERATION, said the budget increase is  too high. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION favored a zero growth budget, but  would accept budget increases for inflation, and requested clear  indication of how its contribution to the budget would be affected  by its ratification of the Protocol.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

The Secretariat  highlighted, inter alia, two scenarios for the programme of work:  one for COP-9 and, in the event of entry into force of the  Protocol, another for COP/MOP-1 to be convened in conjunction with  COP-9.

On the organization of the COP's work, the US, with others,  supported convening high-level round tables. AUSTRALIA said COP-9  should build on the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and  Sustainable Development. NORWAY and BURKINA FASO supported holding  the high-level ministerial segment at the end of each session,  while the US, BRAZIL and SAUDI ARABIA supported holding it at the  beginning of the sessions. Several delegates underscored the need  to separate work on the UNFCCC and the Protocol. The US, with  AUSTRALIA, SLOVENIA, NORWAY, and CANADA, supported the  consideration of a multi-year work programme, and the streamlining  of each session's agenda. On effective participation, the US  objected to the manner in which the CDM Executive Board was  implementing the rules relating to the participation of observers.  The G-77/CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, BURKINA FASO, and the EU,  called for increased funding for the participation of delegates  from developing countries. Several delegations called for a  systematic approach to ensure broad and balanced participation in  all bodies, expert groups and workshops. Chair Stoycheva said that  a contact group chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany) would facilitate  further discussion on these issues.

### NON-ANNEX I FINANCIAL MATTERS

AOSIS and the G-77/CHINA emphasized  the need for the Special Climate Change Fund to support adaptation  activities. He said clear prioritization of activities would  facilitate transparency and expedite funding procedures. CANADA  added that this would enhance donor confidence. The EU, AOSIS and  GHANA underscored the importance of the Special Climate Change  Fund, especially to countries not eligible for support under  existing funds. SAUDI ARABIA said the Special Climate Change Fund  should fund economic diversification activities in developing  countries. Chair Stoycheva suggested a contact group be convened  to address this issue, including the LDC Fund. TANZANIA, for the  LDCs, preferred convening a separate contact group to consider the  LDC Fund and related matters. After brief consultations, the Chair  announced that informal consultations on the LDC Fund would be  held parallel to a contact group on the Special Climate Change  Fund.

# SBSTA

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Chair Thorgeirsson recalled that  implementing decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms) could include two pathways:  strengthening web-based approaches for exchanging information, and  engaging in further methodological work to develop and assess P&Ms.  In the context of national circumstances, several delegates said  that information exchange has been valuable in highlighting the  effectiveness of P&Ms. In addition to inviting non-Annex I Parties  to benefit from information sharing, SWITZERLAND, with AUSTRALIA  and CANADA, supported a standing agenda item on P&Ms. SAUDI ARABIA  said that discussions should be limited to Annex I Parties. The EU  called for additional workshops and web-based tools. JAPAN, with  AUSTRALIA, said that P&Ms should be self-assessed. Chair  Thorgeirsson said Greg Terrill (Australia) and Richard Muyungi  (Tanzania) would co-chair consultations on this item and prepare  SBSTA conclusions and a draft COP decision.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

William Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) reported on  the work of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT).  Delegates commended progress made by the EGTT and highlighted the  need for broad stakeholder participation and transparency in  creating enabling environments for technology transfer; concrete  actions to implement the outcomes of the EGTT and the technology  assessments; and attention to the broader issue of technology  development. A contact group co-chaired by Terry Carrington (UK)  and Kishon Kumar Singh (Trinidad and Tobago) will facilitate  informal consultations and prepare draft conclusions.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Chair Thorgeirsson introduced  the pre-sessional event on R&SO, which considered the Global  Climate Observing System (GCOS) Second Adequacy Report. The GCOS  Secretariat outlined the Report's main recommendations, including  the need to: improve standards for climate observing systems, data  and products; make available products relevant to UNFCCC needs;  and build capacity and improve observing systems in developing  countries by establishing a voluntary donor fund. CANADA, with the  EU and G-77/CHINA, said governments must respond to the  observation needs of the UNFCCC. The G-77/CHINA, with CHINA,  URUGUAY and UGANDA, said that developing countries need financial  support for R&SO. Chair Thorgeirsson said a contact group co- chaired by Stefan Rösner (Germany) and S.N. Sok Appadu (Mauritius)  would continue to deliberate the issue.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### IPCC TAR

In the contact group co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK)  and Walid Al-Malik (UAE), Parties debated whether the contact  group should focus on the process for considering the TAR, or on  substance of the TAR. CHINA, supported by the EU and G-77/CHINA,  suggested focusing on the scientific, technological and  socioeconomic aspects of adaptation and mitigation. Co-Chair  Warrilow cautioned that participants may not be sufficiently  prepared for an in-depth technical discussion. CANADA objected to  focusing on technical details. SAMOA and the US highlighted the  need for an integrated approach to adaptation. SAUDI ARABIA said  adaptation should be addressed in the context of UNFCCC Article  4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects). UGANDA emphasized the need to  consider concrete actions.

### SINKS IN THE CDM

Co-Chair Thelma Krug called attention to the  proposed insurance and temporary units approaches for addressing  non-permanence. BRAZIL noted that its temporary units approach  calls for the CDM Executive Board to supervise the issuance of  temporary units. CANADA addressed questions regarding its  insurance approach and proposed new text requiring, inter alia,  that Annex I Parties holding 'flagged certified emissions  reduction units' replace these units if insurers default on their  replacement obligation. AOSIS reminded delegates that the  modalities under discussion are to apply in the first commitment  period only, and, with the EU, said that it did not support a  stand-alone insurance approach. The EU said that Canada's  insurance policies approach does not fully address non-permanence  because insurance can expire as early as ten years after the end  of the crediting period. Co-Chair Krug said an informal drafting  group on non-permanence would be convened.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Chair Karsten Sach  said the contact group's discussions would focus on two sets of  issues: preparations for COP/MOP-1; and COP-9, future sessional  periods, and effective participation in the UNFCCC process.

Regarding preparations for COP/MOP-1, NORWAY said that while it  respected the legal distinction between the UNFCCC and the  Protocol, it favored as much integration as possible. The US  emphasized the need for an approach that does not merge UNFCCC and  Protocol issues as this would impact on the rights of Parties to  the UNFCCC that are not members of the Protocol. The G-77/CHINA  underscored the importance of maintaining the UNFCCC and Protocol  as separate and distinct bodies, both legally and procedurally.  SAUDI ARABIA, with the US, said that UNFCCC issues should take  priority over Protocol issues.

On the second set of issues, Chair Sach said that the contact  group should consider giving a mandate to the Chairs of the  Subsidiary Bodies to consult with Parties on the proposal to  streamline agendas, and the multi-year work programme. SAUDI  ARABIA, supported by BRAZIL, SLOVENIA and NORWAY, suggested that  these issues be addressed after COP-9.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Co-Chair Stefan Rösner  introduced the Co-Chair's draft conclusions. Participants  discussed, inter alia: priority actions to address deficiencies of  domain-based networks; implementation and coverage of global  terrestrial, ocean and atmospheric networks; accessibility of  satellite data; information requests to the WMO on improving data  transfer; and the need for specialised networks in vulnerable  regions. The draft conclusions request Parties to submit views to  the GCOS Secretariat on the priorities for actions arising from  the Second Adequacy Report, with particular reference to the GCOS  Steering Committee Report. Parties also considered a draft  decision on global observing systems for climate.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Just as the conference center's air conditioning finally started  working Thursday, participants began discussing adaptation, noting  the G-77/China's call for '2003 to be the year of adaptation.'  Several participants expressed concern that discussions on the  adaptation to response measures will continue to hold back  concrete action on adaptation to climate change.

In addition, a fractious discussion took place Thursday on the  legal distinction between the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and the  role of the SBI and SBSTA in serving the COP and the COP/MOP. One  delegate described the emergence of two distinct camps, one  composed of 'segregationists' and the other, 'radical  integrationists.'

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### SBSTA

The SBSTA will convene at 10:00 am in plenary to address  cooperation with relevant international organizations, issues  relating to cleaner or less-greenhouse-gas-emitting energy, issues  relating to the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse  effects of policies and measures) and any other matters.
