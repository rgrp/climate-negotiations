# OPENING OF THE SESSION

Prodipto Ghosh, Secretary, Indian Ministry of Environment and  Forests, highlighted the IPCC's service to the Parties to the  UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol and the policymaking community in  general. R.K. Pachauri, IPCC Chair, said the IPCC must respect the  perspectives of each member and that each member must respect the  perspectives of the Panel. He emphasized the importance of timing  outputs with the global community's policy agenda, and the need  for greater coordination and integration among the WGs.

Michel Jarraud, WMO Secretary-General, highlighted the scientific  input the IPCC would provide to the UNFCCC COP-10, the  International Meeting for the 10-Year Review of the Barbados  Programme of Action for small island developing States, and the  World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR). He said the IPCC's  flexibility should enable it to address other issues and  emphasized the importance of the cross-cutting theme on water.

Klaus Töpfer, UNEP Executive Director, described the IPCC as an  outstanding model of cooperation and integration between science  and policy. He highlighted the significance of the IPCC's work for  related policy processes beyond those focused on climate change.  He noted that AR4 involves more women and developing country  authors than did TAR.

Halldór Thorgeirsson, UNFCCC SBSTA Coordinator, noted that,  following ratification by the Russian Federation, the Kyoto  Protocol is now expected to enter into force in February 2005. He  stressed the need to support adaptation to climate change, noting  also the roles of the UNFCCC and WCDR. Pointing to IPCC-related  processes of importance to the UNFCCC, he reviewed work on climate  monitoring, the ongoing revision of the greenhouse gas (GHG)  reporting guidelines, and good practice guidance on land use,  land-use change and forestry.

Thiru A. Raja, Minister of Environment and Forests, India,  highlighted the significance of ensuring that AR4 findings reach  the public at large. He stressed, inter alia, the need for AR4 to  highlight research in developing countries and the importance of  focusing on adaptation as well as on initiatives for controlling  emissions.

# APPROVAL OF THE IPCC-21 DRAFT REPORT

The report (IPCC-XXII/Doc.3) was approved with an amendment by  SWITZERLAND clarifying an intervention on the outcomes of the  meeting on processes affecting terrestrial carbon stocks and human  influences upon them.

# PROGRESS REPORTS

## WG CONTRIBUTIONS TO AR4

### WG I:

Dahe Qin (China), WG I Co-Chair,  highlighted progress towards the completion of WG I's contribution  to AR4 (IPCC-XXII/Doc.9), noting that Lead Authors and Review  Editors have been selected and that a draft report will be  presented in May 2005. He said WG I has developed an electronic  system for easy access to documents and information.

### WG II

Martin Parry (UK), WG II Co-Chair, introduced the WG II  report (IPCC-XXII/Doc.10). He said the group is on course to  produce its report in a timely manner, stating that it has  selected authors, emphasizing the need for balanced geographic  representation and involving scientists new to the IPCC. He  outlined future steps and the incorporation of cross-cutting  themes, including water.

### WG III

Referring to WG III's report (IPCC-XXXII/Doc.11), Ogunlade  Davidson (Sierra Leone), WG III Co-Chair, said the group has  attempted to increase regional representation on its AR4 team and  introduce new authors into the writing process. He called  attention to upcoming meetings on integrating adaptation and  mitigation and sustainable development, and on emissions scenarios.

IRAN requested that the timetables for the zero-order drafts of  the WGs should be adjusted to accelerate the completion of each  report. INDIA urged that WG I's online journal access be extended  to other WGs. He also recommended that details of gender and  geographical balance should be reported using the same categories  for each WG.

AUSTRIA suggested that Plenary be briefed on the outcomes of the  WG III meetings on emissions scenarios, given the high sensitivity  and relevance of this information. SWITZERLAND stressed that  politically sensitive questions should not be addressed technically.

### SPECIAL REPORT ON SAFEGUARDING THE OZONE LAYER AND GLOBAL CLIMATE  SYSTEM

Bert Metz (the Netherlands), WG III Co-Chair, introduced  the report (IPCC-XXII/Doc.13/Rev.1), reviewed changes in the  report's scope and said it will be completed by April 2005.

### SPECIAL REPORT ON CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE

WG III  Co-Chair Metz said completion of the report has been delayed until  September 2005 to take full account of new literature in the field  (IPCC-XXII/Doc.14). He noted an experiment in the review process  being undertaken in which the expert review is being conducted  anonymously to improve objectivity when responding to comments.

AUSTRIA, opposed by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported the experiment  of using anonymous reviews. Chair Pachauri noted that the outcomes  of this experiment would be discussed by the Panel in due course.

### 2006 IPCC GUIDELINES FOR NATIONAL GHG INVENTORIES

Thelma Krug  (Brazil), Task Force on National GHG Inventories (TFI) Co-Chair,  reported that five meetings have been held covering all five  volumes of the guidelines (IPCC-XXII/Doc.12). She said  methodologies for harvested wood products may be included, and  noted that the guidelines would aim to provide further guidance on  improving consistency of reporting of carbon dioxide emissions.  Noting the complexity and uncertainties of the aerosol issues,  Taka Hiraishi (Japan), TFI Co-Chair, highlighted alternative views  on the timing of an expert meeting and noted that a small expert  meeting would be convened in 2005 (IPCC-XXII/Doc.16). The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION said volcanic aerosols should be addressed. AUSTRIA  said the meeting should include experts from the UN Economic  Commission for Europe. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said volcanic  aerosols should be addressed.SWITZERLAND recommended continuing  work on aerosols, but questioned further discussing methodologies  for issues not fully resolved under the UNFCCC process, and  advocated consultations with SBSTA.

### TGICA

Renate Christ, IPCC Secretary, introduced the progress  report on the TGICA, highlighting outcomes of the first meeting  under its new mandate, held in September 2004 (IPCC-XXII/Doc.15).  She noted that participants considered several issues, including  facilitating access to new General Circulation Model (GCM)  archives, capacity building, and socioeconomic data. The  NETHERLANDS warned against misinterpreting output derived from  TGICA datasets as 'IPCC data.'

# SCOPE, CONTENT AND PROCESS FOR AN AR4 SYR

Chair Pachauri outlined the proposal for an AR4 SYR (IPCC- XXII/Doc.5), describing the need for such a report, highlighting  the suggestion that its length be limited to about 30 pages, and  explaining that the proposed writing team would consist of four to  six writers from each WG and be selected by the IPCC Chair in  consultation with the WG Co-Chairs. IPCC Secretary Christ  introduced two possible timelines, noting that both options take  into account IPCC-XIX/Decision 6, whereby the SYR must be  finalized in the last quarter of 2007.

Martin Manning (US), WG I Technical Support Unit (TSU), expressed  concern regarding the proposed timeline for the presentation of an  advance copy of AR4 SYR at UNFCCC COP-13 in November 2007.  Supported by several others, he urged postponing a decision on  timing. AUSTRIA suggested that the SYR writing team should be  consulted to determine timing.

With AUSTRIA, MOROCCO, SUDAN, the UK, AUSTRALIA and others, NEW  ZEALAND supported the production of AR4 SYR. He stressed the need  for agreement on management, scope and timing of the SYR. Recalling  discussions at IPCC-19, the US asked whether the SYR would address  topics or questions. He pointed to potential problems related to  drafting the SYR prior to approval of the WG reports. In response,  Chair Pachauri noted that IPCC-19 had indicated general consensus  on having topics rather than questions, but noted that this issue  may not be substantive.

FRANCE suggested that AR4 SYR should review whether questions from  TAR SYR have been answered. SWITZERLAND said AR4 SYR should present  findings since TAR.

Numerous speakers stressed that the SYR should not be finalized in  time for COP-13 at the expense of its quality. WG III Co-Chair  Davidson stressed that quality is a given parameter, and, with the  UK and BRAZIL, emphasized the importance of completing the report  by COP-13 for its findings to reach policymakers. Noting the  IPCC's 'main customer' is the UNFCCC, GERMANY said the SYR must be  finalized before COP-13. The UK said no SYR by COP-13 would  represent a 'retrograde step' and make the IPCC 'irrelevant' in  the views of some. BRAZIL noted that it should not be presumed  that timing will affect quality.

ITALY said the SYR should add value to the work of the WGs, provide  an integrated vision and focus on cross-cutting elements. NORWAY  supported employing a communications expert for producing text that  is easily accessible to a broader audience. Discussions on AR4 SYR  will continue in Plenary on Wednesday.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### OUTREACH TASK GROUP

John Stone (Canada), Outreach Task Group  Co-Chair, asked the group to consider fact sheets prepared by the  Secretariat introducing the IPCC, its history, membership,  procedures, and activities. Noting their usefulness, participants  discussed the process for preparing the sheets and suggested that  they be available in the six UN languages. Regarding fact sheets  proposed at IPCC-21 on climate change and small island States,  delegates expressed concern over the need for a different  preparation process, with some participants proposing that the  sheets should be treated as short technical papers. The Task Group  will reconvene on Thursday to discuss outreach for the Special  Reports on Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate  System and on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, and for AR4.

### FINANCIAL TASK FORCE

Marc Gillet (France), Task Force Co-Chair,  requested comments on the IPCC Programme and Budget for 2005-8  (IPCC-XXII/Doc.4/Rev.1). Participants discussed advantages and  disadvantages of a proposal to level the annual expenditure,  requesting details on the implications of such a measure, given  the IPCC's multi-year work programme. In order to advance the IPCC  work programme, some participants stressed that contributions  necessary for publication of AR4 should be collected prior to  2007. They questioned whether under-expenditure in some activities  could compensate for over-expenditure elsewhere. They also  addressed various options for the length and cost of IPCC-23 in  2005. Participants suggested documenting projections of  expenditures and contributions. The three WG TSUs outlined  expected adjustments in their budgets. The Task Force will  reconvene on Wednesday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As officials marked the opening of the meeting with a lamp-lighting  ceremony, the production of a synthesis report for AR4  was widely  considered to be the central issue of this session. While there was  no lack of interventions on the issue, some participants expressed  optimism at the apparent support for the report's preparation and  predicted smooth sailing for the rest of the session. Others  predicted a lack of consensus on content and some warned that too  much emphasis on quality might result in an overly-technical report.
