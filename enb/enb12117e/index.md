# JOINT SBI/SBSTA SESSION

Chairs of the joint contact groups and the JWG on compliance gave  brief presentations to update delegates on progress made on items  on the joint SBI/SBSTA agenda. Their presentations related to  progress made on: adverse effects; compliance; AIJ; mechanisms;  and capacity building. SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) urged the  Parties to intensify their efforts to reach agreement on these  issues.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

AUSTRALIA presented its diagrammatic submission on a compliance  procedure focused on Protocol Article 3.1 (greenhouse gas  reduction and limitation commitments). She highlighted that  facilitation would be available on any issue relating to the  target and that the outcome of the compliance procedure would be a  COP/MOP decision applying the negative consensus rule.

Delegates then addressed the structure of a compliance body. On  the nature of a compliance body, a number of delegates said it  should be a standing body in order to allow consistency and  continuity in its practice, as well as build confidence in its  work. On the frequency of the compliance body's meetings, AOSIS  and SOUTH AFRICA said it would depend on the amount of work it had  before it and that meetings should be held together with other  meetings under the FCCC. The EU said meetings should be held  regularly, and SWITZERLAND suggested it meet at least once a year,  given the continuous work of the compliance body. On the body's  size and composition, a number of delegates suggested a small body  composed of scientific, technical and legal experts appointed by  governments yet acting in their personal capacity. They said the  composition of the body should ensure equitable geographic  distribution. POLAND said there should be an equal number of  Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported  by the US, added that the composition would depend upon the  article under review. SWITZERLAND, with SOUTH AFRICA, said it  should be possible to call on outside experts. He added that  additional Annex I Parties' experts should be called on when  considering Protocol Article 3. A number of delegates, opposed by  SAUDI ARABIA, stressed the need for the body to have its own rules  of procedure. The EU said these rules should be adopted by the  body itself, while KUWAIT, BRAZIL and CHINA said the COP/MOP  should adopt these rules.

On the relationship of the compliance system with Protocol Article  19 (dispute settlement), several Parties said these two procedures  should be kept separate. The US said it envisioned the compliance  system being structured in such a way that a Party would present  information on non-compliance to the compliance committee, which  would follow-up on the matter. Within such a framework, the Party  would decide whether it would raise a bilateral dispute under  Article 19 or initiate the multilateral process under the  compliance system. The UAE said the suggestion by the US would  cause confusion, as similar cases taken through Article 19 and the  compliance system would have differing results. NEW ZEALAND said  the Article 19 process could be the basis for a final appeal  procedure. The UK responded that a bilateral appeal could not flow  from a multilateral process. He highlighted the need to determine  whether the compliance system or the dispute settlement process  would take precedence where the two are in action simultaneously.

On the consequences of non-compliance, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US  said the term 'consequence' could be replaced by 'outcome,' in  order to better reflect the possible use of facilitative measures.  CHINA, with SOUTH AFRICA, specified that Protocol Article 18  (compliance) refers to 'binding consequences' and opposed the  proposed terminology change. On the types of consequences, a  number of delegates emphasized that knowing them in advance would  ensure predictability and deter non-compliance. Several delegates  suggested an indicative list of consequences that would  be  applied gradually, taking into account the cause, type, degree and  frequency of non-compliance. They opposed the US suggestion for  automatic sanctions. JAPAN said the cost of sanctions should be  lower than the cost of withdrawal from the Protocol. The US, NEW  ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and CANADA said a possible sanction could be  the subtraction of excess emissions from the levels permitted  during the subsequent period, with a penalty rate applied.  SWITZERLAND, BRAZIL and IRAN supported financial penalties as a  last resort. AUSTRALIA said the Party concerned should have the  option to choose from a menu of consequences.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### AIJ

Chair de Boer (Netherlands) presented an overview of the  Chair's proposal for a draft decision on AIJ. He said the proposal  takes into account the differences of opinion expressed on whether  to stop the AIJ pilot phase, as well as on the form AIJ should  take if continued. He noted the proposal by some Parties to  introduce incentives, possibly in the form of crediting AIJ  activities, in order to sustain the momentum. He said the draft  proposal tries to find middle ground to accommodate the various  views expressed. The EU introduced its draft proposal that seeks  to stop the non-credited pilot phase now and start an AIJ phase  with possible crediting, subject to decision-making in the  mechanisms negotiation. The contact group will reconvene to  consider the two proposals.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

A Co-Chairs' draft decision was distributed to  the contact group for consideration at its next session. Delegates  then heard presentations from the IPCC, followed by a question- and-answer session. The IPCC said, inter alia, that its Third  Assessment Report (TAR) would provide more details on regional  impacts and other issues relating to implementation of FCCC  Articles 4.8 and 4.9. Concerning the impact of implementing  response measures, he said that modeling is purely speculative and  that it was very difficult to predict changes in the price of oil  because of the many variables involved. He added that countries  take actions that may counter an adverse effect, but that these  are seldom identified as 'climate interventions' and are motivated  by factors other than FCCC implementation.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group continued consideration  of the draft text on guidelines for reporting other issues in  Annex I communications. Participants negotiated wording on a  number of outstanding paragraphs, focusing primarily on the  section relating to research and systematic observation. Proposed  text prepared by the Global Climate Observing Systems (GCOS)  Secretariat on draft guidance for reporting on GCOS was presented  to the group for consideration at its next meeting.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This contact group considered the Co-Chairs'  draft proposal for a draft decision on capacity building for  developing countries that was prepared on the basis of Parties'  comments on the G-77/CHINA's proposal. Some delegates noted that  the revised document did not fully take account of their  submission. There was disagreement on whether the draft decision  should address countries with economies in transition. The group  discussed preambular paragraphs that: recognize the importance of  taking stock of existing capacity-building activities, acknowledge  that, though work has begun, substantial work remains to be done;  recognize the main constraints to implementing the FCCC in  developing countries; underline that capacity-building must be  country driven in accordance with the FCCC provisions; and  emphasize the continuous nature of the capacity-building process.

### LULUCF

This contact group continued discussing the need for data  and information in relation to consideration of the IPCC Special  Report and a decision-making framework in the context of Protocol  requirements. On reporting formats, some delegates noted that  guidelines for the provision of data relating to Article 3.3 (net  changes in GHG emissions and removals) were already provided for  by the IPCC 1996 guidelines and said Parties should abide by them.  Others considered that additional and more specific data and  information were needed. Timing, application and criteria for data  under Articles 3.3 and 3.4 (additional human-induced activities  relating to changes in emissions and removals) and 3.7 (assigned  amounts and LULUCF as a net source of emissions) were discussed.  The group identified transparency, verifiability, accounting for  uncertainties and attribution as criteria under Articles 3.4 and  attempted to identify additional criteria including:  measurability; permanence; prevention of perverse incentives;  avoidance of double accounting; symmetry; conformity with the  FCCC, the Protocol and other conventions; and the 'leakage  effect.'

### MECHANISMS

This contact group deliberated on a possible workplan  up to COP-6. The EU and the US sought intensification of the  process, in particular through technical workshops. CHINA,  INDONESIA and IRAN highlighted the need to convene intersessional  meetings to strengthen intergovernmental work. JAPAN and CANADA  said both technical workshops and intersessional meetings should  be held prior to COP-6. CANADA added that it would like to see a  refined negotiating text at COP-6. The G-77/CHINA and others  highlighted the need for transparency in the process and adequate  developing country expert participation in the technical  workshops. SUDAN said Parties needed time to review the  information and findings of technical workshops.

The G-77/CHINA said it was premature to work toward a draft  negotiating text, as Parties were still at the stage of making  submissions, noting convergence/divergence and synthesizing views.  In response to a query by Chair Chow, the G-77/CHINA defined a  draft negotiating text as 'the penultimate stage in the text that  the COP will finally adopt.' JAPAN, the US and AUSTRALIA defined  it as a living document that would go through several drafts.  Chair Chow noted that the text would be a living document  synthesizing the views of all Parties to facilitate the  negotiating process. He said he will prepare conclusions on the  timetable of work leading to COP-6.

### NATIONAL SYSTEMS

This contact group considered draft conclusions  on national systems, adjustments and guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communication of information) and 8  (review of information). It also considered a draft annex setting  out basic elements of national systems under Protocol Article 5.1  (national systems for GHG emissions and removals) that had been  presented by JAPAN and amended after informal consultations by a  smaller group of Parties. Discussion focused on a paragraph  relating to adjustments under Protocol Article 5.2 (methodology).  After considerable discussion, the group agreed to wording noting  that the SBSTA 'considered' rather than 'agreed' that adjustments  referred to in this Article should only be applied when inventory  data submitted by Parties are incomplete and/or are calculated in  a way that is not consistent with the IPCC 1996 Revised Guidelines  as set out by any good practice agreed on by the COP. The group  concluded its work on both documents, which will be submitted to  SBSTA for its consideration.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Chair El Ghaouth (Mauritania) informed  delegates that a drafting group had been working on a draft text  compiling proposals by the EU, the G-77/CHINA and others, and  suggested that the contact group adjourn to allow the drafting  group to continue its work.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The need for country-specific data related to LULUCF activities,  including additional human-induced activities related to changes  in GHG emissions and removals, continues to be a contentious  issue. Some participants feel that hesitation on the part of some  Annex I Parties to provide country-specific data stems from a  reluctance to reveal the implications of Article 3.4 activities  (such as agriculture and land-use change) on the amount of their  overall emissions and their ability to meet their Protocol  targets. Others are of the view that the more data available, the  greater the prospects for informed decision-making about sinks.  The concern is that this controversy could have an impact on the  timing of a conclusive decision on LULUCF, and therefore the entry  into force of the Protocol.
