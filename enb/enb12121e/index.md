# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

### PROGRESS MADE

During the morning session, delegates exchanged  views on progress made in dealing with climate change and on  lessons and challenges.

Several developing country Parties stressed the need for  technology transfer, capacity building, financial resources and  adaptation to address climate change. Some Parties urged an  increased focus on renewable energy. BHUTAN and BANGLADESH called  for special attention to LDCs' needs. NEW ZEALAND underscored the  need for greater attention to greenhouse gases (GHGs) other than  CO2.

INDONESIA emphasized the importance of making benefit assessments,  not just cost assessments, of the Protocol. He called for the  Protocol's entry into force by 2002. SWITZERLAND, JAPAN and the  NETHERLANDS urged Parties not to wait for ratification before  starting to implement actions to address climate change.

On lessons learned, FINLAND, with CANADA, underscored good working  relationships between all partners and stakeholders in  implementing climate change policies. He added that there is a  need to set the framework and rules for market operations. Some  Parties stressed the involvement of the private sector. The  EUROPEAN COMMISSION said experience has shown that reducing  emissions has been less costly than expected and has led to  greater benefits. With SWITZERLAND and HUNGARY, she emphasized the  need for increased domestic action and called for continuation of  AIJ and a smooth transition in the future to the clean development  mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI).

The PHILIPPINES and CANADA recommended the use of no-regrets  policies. MALAYSIA and MEXICO sought consistency in policies  between different environmental fora. BULGARIA called for a  meeting to address the specific features of countries with  economies in transition (EITs) before COP-6.

SWEDEN highlighted sector integration, sector responsibility and  economic instruments as being central to FCCC implementation.  GERMANY said addressing climate change could create new jobs.

NIGERIA said Annex I countries were unsympathetic to its concerns  about the effects of response measures on its economy. IRAN  highlighted the need for confidence-building between developed and  developing countries through concrete practical cooperation. CHINA  said attempts by some Parties to get developing countries to  'meaningfully participate' were destroying confidence-building  efforts between developing and developed countries.

### THE WAY FORWARD

During the afternoon session, delegates exchanged  views on the way forward in relation to promoting implementation  of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) and the early entry into  force of the Kyoto Protocol.

On outcomes from COP-5, the UK, supported by KAZAKHSTAN and the  US, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed a Bonn Declaration  reaffirming the political will to complete the BAPA by COP-6.  KUWAIT said the proposal for a Bonn Declaration was premature.

On preparations for COP-6, many Parties called for intensified  efforts and for the role of the President to be strengthened in  order to achieve success on the BAPA at COP-6. ARGENTINA,  supported by FINLAND and BENIN, said innovative approaches were  needed and called for the establishment of small task forces in  the run-up to COP-6. She said traditional groupings among  countries to develop common positions may no longer be  appropriate.

JAPAN, supported by KAZAKHSTAN, BOTSWANA, the US, CANADA, BENIN,  ICELAND, HONDURAS and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested that COP-5 President  Szyszko (Poland) be empowered to appoint a special facilitator to  assist negotiations and help Parties realize the BAPA by COP-6.

AUSTRALIA proposed the establishment of a Committee of the Whole  (COW) chaired by a facilitator vested with the requisite authority  by the COP-5 President. The US said it could support this, but  that a COW should not substitute for Japan's proposal for a  facilitator. BELGIUM supported a flexible approach focused on  achieving successful outcomes and said a COW or another new  structure should be transparent and monitored by all Parties.

CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, VENEZUELA, KUWAIT, INDONESIA, and LIBYA,  opposed the proposals to establish new groups or mechanisms to  assist progress toward COP-6, stressing that the existing FCCC  bodies and structures should be employed to this end. CHINA,  supported by KUWAIT and others, said a facilitator would not be  able to visit and confer with all Parties. Several Parties said  any new mechanism or group should operate in a transparent and  accountable manner. NORWAY said ministers should be engaged in the  process between the COPs.

Other issues highlighted by Parties included: implementation of  FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects); the framework and  rules for CDM and other mechanisms; the need for domestic action;  the supplementarity of the mechanisms; capacity building;  voluntary commitments; AIJ; and ratification of the Protocol.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Rønneberg (Marshall Islands) presented the draft report  of the JWG on its work during the 11th session of the joint  SBI/SBSTA as well as the decision on the future work of the JWG  annexed to this report. The JWG discussed the draft decision which  requests the JWG to report to COP-6 to enable it to adopt a  decision on a compliance system under the Protocol at COP-6. The  UK, CHILE, MICRONESIA, COOK ISLANDS, SWITZERLAND, the US, TUVALU,  AOSIS, CANADA, JAPAN, AUSTRIA, KIRIBATI, the EU, NEW ZEALAND,  FRANCE, the GAMBIA, BRAZIL, SOUTH AFRICA, AUSTRALIA, SLOVENIA,  NORWAY, POLAND, BELGIUM and GERMANY supported the adoption of the  Co-Chairs' draft decision in its current form. QATAR, KUWAIT, the  SUDAN, VENEZUELA, SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA, ALGERIA, NIGERIA, SYRIA,  OMAN and JORDAN suggested alternative language whereby the JWG  would report to COP-6 'with a view' to adopting a decision on a  compliance system, as this would be more consistent with the BAPA.  The JWG adopted the draft report, taking note of the views  expressed. Rønneberg suggested that the difference in ambition be  taken-up in the joint SBSTA/SBI meeting.

# JOINT SBI/SBSTA

### Capacity building:

Delegates forwarded a recommendation for COP-5  to adopt the draft decisions on capacity building in developing  countries (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.9) and on capacity building in EITs  (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.10). The MARSHALL ISLANDS expressed its  opposition to a top-down approach and entered a reservation on the  request to the Secretariat to coordinate with bilateral and  multilateral institutions in preparing the elements of a draft  framework for capacity building activities.

### MECHANISMS

Delegates adopted the draft conclusions, including a  draft decision, on mechanisms pursuant to Protocol Articles 6  (JI), 12 (CDM) and 17 (Emissions Trading) (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.6).

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY

Delegates adopted the draft  conclusions on AIJ under the pilot phase, including a draft  decision recommended to COP-5 for adoption (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.5).  Minor amendments were made by AIJ contact group Co-Chair de Boer  (The Netherlands) and the paragraph on the eligibility of AIJ for  incorporation under JI and CDM was deleted.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Delegates adopted the recommendation for COP-5 to  adopt the draft decision on the implementation of FCCC Articles  4.8 and 4.9 (Decision 3/CP.3 and Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14)  and matters relating to Protocol Article 3.14  (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.8).

### COMPLIANCE

Delegates considered the report of the JWG on  compliance on its work during SB-11, as well as the annexed  decision on the future work of the JWG (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.7). IRAN  requested SAUDI ARABIA and the countries on whose behalf it spoke  to join the consensus. SAUDI ARABIA noted that since the joint  SBI/SBSTA had recommended for adoption the draft decision on  adverse effects, he would join the consensus. The report and its  annexed decision were adopted.

# SBI

The Chair of the contact group on non-Annex I communications,  Mohamed Ould el Ghaouth (Mauritania), introduced amendments to the  decision on non-Annex I communications  (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.10/Add.1) including, inter alia: a request to  the consultative group of experts to consider, 'as appropriate'  the needs for and the availability of financial resources and  technical support; and a request to the Secretariat to make  information on non-Annex I communication experts available on the  FCCC Internet site. The decision was adopted as amended.

Decisions on income and budget performance in the biennium 1998 -  1999 (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.9) and on the programme budget for the  biennium 2000 - 2001 (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.8) were adopted, on the  understanding that the scale of contributions set therein would  not set a precedent. Delegates then adopted the draft report of  SBI-11 (FCCC/SBI/ 1999/L.11).

# SBSTA

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS FROM ANNEX I PARTIES

Delegates adopted by  consensus the Chairs' draft conclusions and recommended a draft  decision to the COP on 'best practices for policies and measures'  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/ CRP.10).

### LULUCF

SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) recalled that delegates had  already adopted most of the draft conclusions and said that the  new document (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/ CRP.8/Rev.2) includes a decision on  the issue whereby the COP endorses a work programme and elements  of a decision-making framework to address LULUCF. The MARSHALL  ISLANDS registered its reservation on attempts by international  financial institutions and the financial mechanism to influence  what should be government decisions. The draft conclusions and  recommendation for a decision were adopted.

### EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM FUEL USED IN INTERNATIONAL  TRANSPORTATION

Delegates adopted the draft conclusions and draft  decision (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/ CRP.11) after deleting two alternative  paragraphs, the first calling for ICAO and IMO to continue efforts  to limit GHGs taking into account FCCC Articles 2 (objectives) and  3 (principles) and, in particular, common and differentiated  responsibilities; and the second taking into account the goals of  the Protocol and the FCCC.

### COOPERATION WITH SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONS

On a draft decision  urging Parties and IGOs to provide financial support to the IPCC  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.9), delegates differed on the need for a  reference to the GEF. The EU, with AUSTRALIA and CANADA, opposed  it as the GEF would not be able to provide the support the IPCC  required. CHINA said the GEF 'cake' was barely enough to go around  130 developing countries. BRAZIL favored the reference as the GEF  was the FCCC financial mechanism and a significant proportion of  the IPCC's finances are used to finance developing country  participation. Parties adopted a decision deleting the reference  to the GEF but inviting the 'SBI to consider the issue of support  to IPCC at SB -12 in the context of recommending additional  guidance to the GEF.' Delegates adopted the draft report of SBSTA- 11 (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.11).

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Although Ministers at the high-level segment agreed on the need to  intensify efforts in preparing for COP-6, a proposal by Japan to  establish a facilitator to assist the COP-5 President in  undertaking consultations and maintaining the necessary political  momentum was met with mixed feelings in the corridors. While some  considered that a full-time facilitator would be indispensable to  accelerating the pace of negotiations in the run-up to COP-6,  others felt this would be detrimental to the open, participatory  process that many believe to be crucial to a successful outcome at  COP-6. A number of observers linked the proposal for a facilitator  to the fact that COP-6 will take place earlier rather than later.  Some suggested that the key to success at COP-6 could lie in  combining a fully-participatory approach, supported by capacity  building, with the political impetus that a facilitator could  provide.
