# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

The FCCC was adopted on 9 May 1992, and was opened for signature  at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in June  1992. The Convention entered into force on 21 March 1994, 90  days after receipt of the 50th ratification. It has been  ratified by 176 countries.

### COP-1

The first meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the  FCCC (COP-1) took place in Berlin from 28 March - 7 April 1995.  In addition to addressing a number of important issues related  to the future of the Convention, delegates reached agreement on  what many believed to be the central issue before COP-1 -  adequacy of commitments, the 'Berlin Mandate.' The result was to  establish an open-ended Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate  (AGBM) to begin a process toward appropriate action for the  period beyond 2000, including the strengthening of the  commitments of Annex I Parties through the adoption of a  protocol or another legal instrument.

COP-1 also requested the Secretariat to make arrangements for  sessions of SBSTA and SBI. SBSTA would serve as the link between  the information provided by competent international bodies, and  the policy-oriented needs of the COP. During the AGBM process,  SBSTA addressed several issues, including the treatment of the  IPCC's Second Assessment Report (SAR). SBI was created to  develop recommendations to assist the COP in the review and  assessment of the implementation of the Convention and in the  preparation and implementation of its decisions. SBI also  addressed several key issues during the AGBM process, such as  the national communications and activities implemented jointly  (AIJ).

The Ad Hoc Group on Article 13 (AG13) was set up to consider the  establishment of a multilateral consultative process (MCP)  available to Parties to resolve questions on implementation.  AG13-1, held from 30-31 October 1995 in Geneva, decided to  request Parties, non-Parties, and intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations to make written submissions in  response to a questionnaire on an MCP. Delegates continued their  discussion over the course of the next three meetings. At their  fifth session, they agreed that the MCP should be advisory  rather than supervisory in nature and AG13 should complete its  work by COP-4.

### AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE

The AGBM met eight times  between August 1995 and COP-3 in December 1997. During the first  three sessions, delegates focused on analyzing and assessing  possible policies and measures to strengthen the commitments of  Annex I Parties, how Annex I countries might distribute or share  new commitments and whether commitments should take the form of  an amendment or protocol. AGBM-4, which coincided with COP-2 in  Geneva in July 1996, completed its in-depth analysis of the  likely elements of a protocol and States appeared ready to  prepare a negotiating text. At AGBM-5, which met in December  1996, delegates recognized the need to decide whether or not to  allow mechanisms that would provide Annex I Parties with  flexibility in meeting quantified emissions limitation and  reduction objectives (QELROs).

As the protocol was drafted during the sixth and seventh  sessions of the AGBM, in March and August 1997, respectively,  delegates 'streamlined' a framework compilation text by merging  or eliminating some overlapping provisions within the myriad of  proposals. Much of the discussion centered on a proposal from  the EU for a 15% cut in a 'basket' of three greenhouse gases  (GHGs) by the year 2010 compared to 1990 levels. In October  1997, as AGBM- 8 began, US President Bill Clinton included a  call for 'meaningful participation' by developing countries in  the negotiating position he announced in Washington. With those  words, the debates that shaped agreement back in 1995  resurfaced, with an insistence on G-77/China involvement once  again linked to the level of ambition acceptable by the US. In  response, the G-77/China distanced itself from attempts to draw  developing countries into agreeing to anything that could be  interpreted as new commitments.

### COP-3

The Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) was held from  1-11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. Over 10,000 participants,  including representatives from governments, intergovernmental  organizations, NGOs and the media, attended the Conference,  which included a high-level segment featuring statements from  over 125 ministers. Following a week and a half of intense  formal and informal negotiations, including a session that began  on the final evening and lasted into the following day, Parties  to the FCCC adopted the Kyoto Protocol on 11 December. In the  Kyoto Protocol, Annex I Parties to the FCCC agreed to  commitments to reduce their overall emissions of six GHGs by at  least 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. The Protocol  also established emissions trading, 'joint implementation' (JI)  between developed countries, and a 'clean development mechanism'  (CDM) to encourage joint emissions reduction projects between  developed and developing countries. As of 15 March 1999, 84  countries had signed the Kyoto Protocol.

### POST-KYOTO FCCC MEETINGS

The subsidiary bodies of the FCCC met  from 2-12 June 1998 in Bonn, Germany. SBSTA-8 agreed to draft  conclusions on, inter alia, cooperation with relevant  international organizations, methodological issues, and  education and training. SBI-8 reached conclusions on, inter  alia, national communications, the financial mechanism and the  second review of adequacy of Annex I Party commitments. In its  sixth session, AG13 concluded its work on the MCP's functions.  After joint SBI/SBSTA consideration and extensive contact group  debates on the flexibility mechanisms, delegates could only  agree to a compilation document containing proposals from the G-77/China, the EU and the US on the issues for discussion and  frameworks for implementation.

### COP-4

The Fourth Conference of the Parties (COP-4) was held  from 2-13 November 1998 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and was  attended by over 5,000 participants. During the two-week  meeting, delegates deliberated decisions for the COP during SBI- 9 and SBSTA-9. Issues related to the Kyoto Protocol were  considered in joint SBI/SBSTA sessions. A high-level segment,  which heard statements from over 100 ministers and heads of  delegation, was convened on Thursday, 12 November. Following  hours of high-level 'closed door' negotiations and a final  plenary session that concluded early Saturday morning, delegates  adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Under the Plan of  Action, the Parties declared their determination to strengthen  the implementation of the Convention and prepare for the future  entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. The Plan contains the  Parties' resolution to demonstrate substantial progress on: the  financial mechanism; the development and transfer of technology;  the implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9, as well as  Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14; activities implemented jointly  (AIJ); the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol; and the  preparations for the first meeting of the Parties (COP/MOP-1).

# RECENT MEETINGS

### IEA WORKSHOP ON POLICIES AND MEASURES

The International Energy  Agency (IEA) held an international workshop from 15-16 April  1999 in Paris to exchange the experiences of Member countries in  the design and implementation of policies and measures aimed at  reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy. The workshop's  key messages include:* while policy responses may differ based on national  circumstances, the challenges remain the same across countries,  in particular in the energy sector. Countries can benefit from  information exchange on policies and measures; * the gap between the present situation and Kyoto objectives  requires new domestic policies and measures in the energy sector  to achieve the agreed emissions reduction goals; * the distinction between economic instruments and regulatory  approaches is artificial. Both types of policies are needed; * the implementation of economic instruments such as taxes  requires accompanying measures to account for social and  competitiveness concerns; and, * CO2 emissions from transport are growing rapidly and few  policies seem to have had significant impacts on this trend so  far. Policies to reduce emissions from transport should aim at  changing behavior as well as changing technology.

### TECHNICAL WORKSHOP ON MECHANISMS UNDER ARTICLES 6, 12 AND 17 OF  THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

The FCCC Technical Workshop on Mechanisms  under Articles 6, 12 and 17 of the Kyoto Protocol was held from  9-15 April 1999 at La Redoute in Bonn-Bad Godesberg, Germany.  The workshop was designed to advance the discussion on  technological and methodological aspects of Article 6 (JI),  Article 12 (CDM) and Article 17 (emissions trading) so that the  Conference of the Parties can take decisions on all three  mechanisms at its sixth session. The workshop was attended by  approximately 100 invited participants, including experts from  Parties and representatives from governments, UN agencies, and  intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. Core  topics at the workshop included reference case/baseline  methodologies, additionality, verification and reporting in  relation to the CDM and Article 6 (JI) projects. Further issues  addressed included the validation and funding of projects under  the CDM and the adaptation component, and reporting,  verification and accountability issues related to emissions  trading. Participants also exchanged views on capacity building  for developing country Parties. The ENB report is available at:  http://www.iisd.ca/climate/techwork/

### INTER-AGENCY TASK FORCE ON ENERGY

The Inter-Agency Committee on  Sustainable Development (IACSD), in September 1998, decided to  establish an Ad Hoc Inter-Agency Task Force on Energy with a  view to ensuring a collaborative contribution of UN  organizations to the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD)  process on energy and sustainable development. The first meeting  of the Task Force took place on 8 April 1999 in New York. The  Task Force agreed that activities to be undertaken should be  complementary and mutually supportive and that duplication of  work, such as that undertaken by the FCCC, should be avoided.  Task Force members reviewed activities currently underway and/or  planned by them in preparation for the ninth session of the CSD  (CSD-9). To enhance coordination and promote synergies among  these activities, they decided to establish an electronic  network and agreed to provide updated information on ongoing and  envisioned work so that a matrix of UN activities geared towards  CSD-9 could be established. The Task Force will meet again in  September/October 1999 to follow-up on preparations for CSD-9.  For more information contact: Kyaw Kyaw Shane; e-mail:  shane@un.org
