# SBSTA

### OTHER MATTERS

Implementation of Protocol Article 2.3: Chair  Benrageb urged Parties to move forward on this issue. SAUDI ARABIA  expressed disappointment about the lack of progress on Article 2.3  since COP-8. The EU, CANADA and JAPAN stated that Article 2.3 is  sufficiently reflected in decision 5/CP.7. Chair Benrageb will  consult informally on the issue.

###     Any other matters

CHILE said a panel of international experts  should address transport and the CDM. The GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT  CENTER presented on the importance of peat-land ecosystems in  regulating the global atmosphere.

### ADAPTATION

JAMAICA, for the G-77/China, said the SBSTA in-session  workshop held on 8 December highlighted the urgency for action to  address adaptation. AUSTRALIA stressed the importance of  adaptation for both developed and developing countries. The EU  recommended reviewing the outcomes of the SBSTA-20 and SBSTA-21  workshops to identify impacts of different levels and rates of  climate change, and options for adaptation. The US said that  individual extreme weather events cannot be linked to climate  change. SUDAN, for the Africa Group, and ARGENTINA said adaptation  is a global priority. JAPAN said both mitigation and adaptation  should be addressed at the global level. CANADA called for  strengthening the adaptation knowledge-base. On ways to build  adaptive capacity, NICARAGUA pointed to participatory processes  that include local communities and technical experts, and CHINA  urged mobilization of funds and technology transfer from developed  countries.

TUNISIA supported strengthening links and developing joint research  projects with other conventions. NEW ZEALAND said that adaptation  is a sub-element of sustainable development in developed countries.  SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern about the lack of action on  adaptation. SOUTH AFRICA said that the UNFCCC should lead action  on adaptation. A contact group on the issue, co-chaired by Philip  Gwage (Uganda) and David Warrilow (UK), was established.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### CDM EB

The contact group, chaired by Ra√∫l Estrada-Oyuela  (Argentina), reviewed a draft decision and heard general remarks.  The US proposed an amendment to Rule 27 of the EB Rules of  Procedure on attendance at meetings, stating that 'attendance  means physical presence in the room in which the EB meets.' Chair  Estrada-Oyuela noted that this type of amendment has budgetary  implications and requires guidance from the contact group on the  financial mechanism. JAPAN emphasized the need to prioritize  energy projects and, with the EU, the need for transparency. The  EU and SWITZERLAND noted the importance of addressing the  implications of CDM activities for the achievement of objectives  of other multilateral environmental agreements. JAPAN said he  would provide text on proposals for new baseline and monitoring  methodologies for types of project activities in sectors not yet  covered by approved methodologies.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

This contact group, chaired by Crispin  d'Auvergne (Saint Lucia), discussed, inter alia, funding of an  information clearing house. The Secretariat noted that the first  year of the development phase of the project will require  US$165,000. The US suggested that annual cost estimates of the  clearing house should be prepared. Regarding regional workshops,  AOSIS underlined the need for a SIDS workshop. The US and others  requested information on how this workshop would differ from other  workshops proposed in Uruguay and Japan. Chair d'Auvergne will  prepare draft conclusions for further discussion.

### ADAPTATION

Contact group Co-Chair David Warrilow requested input  from delegates for draft conclusions to be prepared by the Co- Chairs. He noted that there is insufficient time for a decision at  COP-10. ARGENTINA proposed having the political importance of  adaptation recognized as an outcome of COP-10. Many delegates  highlighted the complementary roles of SBI and SBSTA on adaptation,  and the need to avoid duplication of work. ARGENTINA, CHINA and  others called for transfer of adaptation technology, with GHANA  asking for development of indigenous technologies, and INDIA for  recognition of traditional knowledge.

The EU and ARGENTINA said adaptation should be included in  sustainable development plans. JAPAN and the EU stressed the need  to balance adaptation and mitigation, while INDIA said focus  should be on adaptation. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION called for  enhanced coordination with the Convention on Biological Diversity,  Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the UN Convention to Combat  Desertification with regard to adaptation. TANZANIA stressed the  need to identify areas where immediate action is required.

### LDCS

This group was co-chaired by Bubu Jallow (the Gambia) and  Ricardo Moita (Portugal). Delegates discussed guidance to the GEF  on the LDC Fund and the LDC Expert Group (LEG). CANADA commended  the LEG's work, and TANZANIA, for the LDCs, proposed extending the  LEG's mandate to support the implementation of national adaptation  programmes of action (NAPAs). On guidance to the GEF, LDCs, SAMOA  and MALAWI expressed concern over co-financing requirements,  noting that decision 6/CP.9 (guidance on the operation of the LDC  Fund) provides for full funding of NAPAs. The GEF said that, since  decision 6/CP.9 requires the GEF to develop criteria for full  funding, some activities would qualify for full funding, while  others would build on existing development projects and require  co-financing from other sources, or in-kind contributions by  recipient governments. The EU said co-financing emphasizes  countries' sense of ownership over projects.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates considered a  Co-Chairs' working draft on the timing of financing, completion  and submission of non-Annex I national communications. Parties  discussed at length wording on the issue of project financing  continuity, and the timing of applications for financing for  second or third national communications. On timing of submission  of national communications after the initial disbursement of  funds, the G-77/CHINA stressed that this should occur within five  years of disbursement, while the EU preferred three years.  AUSTRALIA suggested four, as a compromise. The G-77/CHINA noted  that Annex I Parties are entitled to three to five years between  submission of their national communication. NEW ZEALAND noted that  the timing of submissions following funding disbursement is not  the same as the frequency of submissions. Co-Chair Anders Turesson  said the Co-Chairs will draft a compromise text.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chairs Paul Watkinson and Samuel Adejuwon  reviewed an amendment from the EU and a draft decision text  proposed by the G-77/China. The US, supported by several others,  requested time to analyze the new texts. The Co-Chairs will  prepare a consolidated text and the group will reconvene informally.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The Co-Chairs tabled draft conclusions, and  MALAYSIA, for the G-77/China, circulated a draft decision and a  position paper. Delegates disputed procedural matters, including  which text to begin discussing, with several Annex I Parties  preferring to discuss the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions  paragraph-by-paragraph, and the G-77/CHINA stating that the draft  conclusions do not reflect the G-77/China's concerns. The  Co-Chairs will prepare revised draft conclusions incorporating  the G-77/China's concerns.

# SBSTA IN-SESSION WORKSHOP ON PRACTICAL OPPORTUNITIES AND SOLUTIONS  FOR MITIGATION

The in-session workshop was chaired by SBSTA Chair Benrageb.  Delegates heard presentations by experts, followed by  question-and-answer discussions, and concluded with an exchange  of views and lessons learned.

### PRESENTATIONS

Rob Socolow, Princeton University, US, examined  future carbon emissions scenarios, and proposed to use 'wedges,' a  methodology to account for reductions in future emissions, whereby  each 'wedge' is equivalent to one billion tons of avoided carbon  emissions per year over the next fifty years. Socolow addressed  different strategies to achieve wedges, noting that a portfolio  approach is necessary.

James Shevlin, Australian Greenhouse Office, described the  Australian mitigation approach, stressing that energy efficiency  must be central to any mitigation strategy, regardless of the  country. He elaborated on barriers to energy efficiency and the  Australian experience in overcoming them.

Paul Kirai, Kenya Association of Manufacturers, described the  Industrial Energy Efficiency Project in Kenya, highlighting the  need to cooperate with the private sector, build confidence and  maintain flexibility in public programmes.

Alfred Szwarc, Ministry of Science and Technology, Brazil, spoke  on biomass fuel use in Brazil. Szwarc said the biomass industry  has enhanced energy security and diversity, provided environmental  benefits, reduced the balance of payments, and has created one  million jobs in Brazil. Participants discussed, inter alia, the  risks posed by plantations to forest lands and barriers to  technology uptake. Szwarc noted that Brazil is championing biomass  fuel technology globally, but has no plans to expand biomass  plantations into the Amazon region.

Christine Copley, World Coal Institute, UK, spoke on the prospects  for coal in the context of sustainable development. She drew  attention to advanced technologies, such as super-critical plants  and integrated gasification combined-cycle technology, and said  carbon capture and storage technology also shows promise, although  storage capacity is limited.

Hernan Carlino, Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable  Development, Argentina, spoke on greenhouse gas mitigation  opportunities in the waste sector in his country. He noted that  waste is commonly disposed in landfills and open dumps, and said a  new national strategy is being developed to address this problem.  The new strategy encourages, inter alia, household waste sorting  and methane gas recovery. He drew attention to two recently  approved national projects on waste disposal located in the city  and province of Buenos Aires. Participants discussed the  implications of the new strategy for recycling rates and per  capita waste production.

Robert Dixon, US Department of Energy, highlighted the environmental  and energy security benefits of hydrogen and fuel cell technology,  and noted challenges in hydrogen production, storage, delivery  infrastructure and safety. He indicated that it would be possible  to realize a full hydrogen economy by 2050.

### DISCUSSION

AUSTRALIA and JAPAN stressed the importance of  fostering multilateral cooperation on mitigation initiatives.  CANADA expressed optimism at the varied mitigation efforts ongoing  globally. The US highlighted the importance of partnerships and  proposed that SBSTA address policy tools for clean coal production  and energy efficiency. The INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY (IEA) said  effective mitigation requires a portfolio of technologies and  effective policy frameworks. He noted that the IEA is hosting more  than 40 implementing agreements on technology development. The EU,  with the COOK ISLANDS, said barriers to the uptake of small-scale  renewable energy need to be addressed further.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Thursday was a quiet day according to many delegates, so quiet  that no country was awarded the coveted fossil of the day prize by  environmental NGOs. The day was dominated by an in-session workshop  on mitigation, which was endorsed by many Parties as a success.  Some suspect that this may be the calm before the storm over  whether or how to discuss post-2012 actions. In other corners of  the conference hall, delegates were in high spirits after  informally reaching agreement on the draft decision text on LULUCF  good practice guidance.
