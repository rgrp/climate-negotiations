# PLENARY

Many speakers, such as URUGUAY, NICARAGUA and SAUDI ARABIA,  cautioned against straying from the ultimate objective of the  Convention and spending an inordinate amount of time discussing  cooperative mechanisms, which only serve selected countries. The  AFRICAN GROUP said cooperative implementation should not  overshadow the review of commitments, technology transfer and  capacity building. CHINA warned that the Kyoto Protocol should  not copy the Montreal Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol's  implementation depends on technology and resource transfers to  developing countries. He cautioned against imposing reduction  commitments on developing countries.

NORWAY opposed quantitative caps on the use of flexibility  mechanisms. With COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA and IRAN, he noted they  are supplemental to domestic action. SOUTH AFRICA and IRAN noted  that COP-4 cannot finalize work on setting modalities and  guidelines for the mechanisms. SLOVENIA reiterated the urgency  of action, calling for the proposed working groups to provide  sufficient input to COP-4 on the elaboration of modalities,  rules and guidelines.

AUSTRALIA, supported by RUSSIA, called for cost-effective  mechanisms and said that credits should be transferable across  the three mechanisms for the achievement of the Protocol's aims.  The EU said the AIJ experience gained since COP-1 can provide  valuable guidance on questions of flexibility mechanisms in the  Protocol. He proposed that SBSTA's work program at COP-4 include  follow-up to the June 1998 reporting deadline. ARGENTINA  stressed the importance of setting COP-4's priorities and  suggested moving on those issues, such as the CDM, where  consensus has been achieved.

GEORGIA cautioned that CDM, in its current form, makes  developing countries dependent on the will of developed  countries and said there is a need for financial resources to  assist developing countries. MAURITIUS emphasized CDM for  poverty alleviation and ETHIOPIA called for elaboration on this  at COP-4. With COLOMBIA, COSTA RICA, SLOVENIA, SENEGAL, NIGERIA,  and IRAN, NORWAY called CDM a tool for sustainable development  in non-Annex I countries that should also contribute to climate  change objectives. He said additional time is needed for  inclusion of sinks in CDM.

COLOMBIA and VENEZUELA recommended that CDM projects, inter  alia, produce real emissions reductions and, with COSTA RICA,  accord with host country wishes. Supported by COSTA RICA,  NICARAGUA, ARGENTINA and IRAN, COLOMBIA opposed ignoring sinks,  noting that they are also biodiversity deposits. COSTA RICA also  opposed re-negotiation on what kinds of sinks are included.  KOREA expressed reservations about the inclusion of forestry  under CDM and cautioned against the temptation to micromanage  CDM through extended bureaucracies. IRAN distinguished CDM from  other mechanisms as a multilateral rather than bilateral  mechanism, with international supervision. He cautioned against  turning CDM into a clean energy mechanism. URUGUAY called for  further definition and contact group discussions.

The AFRICAN GROUP, supported by SOUTH AFRICA, noted that African  countries have neither participated in AIJ nor received funding  because donors seem to prefer other regions. Several countries,  such as BURKINA FASO, NIGERIA and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC,  stressed the need to wait until the end of the AIJ pilot phase  before drawing conclusions on its viability. IRAN favored  continuation of the AIJ pilot phase and development of  guidelines for it.

KOREA and NIGERIA stressed that emissions trading should  supplement national reductions and cautioned that rules to  govern it must be defined in advance to avoid compliance and  verification problems. CHINA noted that emissions trading is  illegal until the COP defines relevant rules, principles, and  guidelines. Supporting emissions trading, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION  said the Russian people had paid a very high price for 'hot air'  by reducing their living standards.

CANADA tabled a discussion paper on principles, modalities,  rules and guidelines for an international emissions trading  regime on behalf of Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, New  Zealand, Norway, Russia and the US. The tradable unit would be  Assigned Amount Units (AAUs). AAUs would be denominated in 'CO2  equivalent' and would express one metric tonne of CO2 equivalent  emissions. Each Annex B Party could issue serialized AAUs from  its 'assigned amounts.' AAUs would be valid until used to offset  emissions for the purposes of contributing to compliance.

Parties could trade directly and/or authorize legal entities to  acquire and or transfer AAUs. Each Annex B Party would need to  comply with Article 5 (national emission estimation systems) and  Article 7 (emissions inventories). They must also establish and  maintain a national system for recording their 'assigned  amounts' and tracking AAUs held, transferred or acquired. Each  Party would also be required to report annually on activities  and be assessed for compliance at the end of the commitment  period.

The Chair announced the terms of reference for a joint SBSTA/SBI  contact group to prepare a draft decision(s) on: the division of  labor for forthcoming SBI and SBSTA sessions; substantive issues  regarding AIJ, JI, the CDM, and emissions trading; and  elaboration of a work programme.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

On provision for the second review of the adequacy of Annex I  Party commitments the PHILIPPINES, for the G-77/CHINA, supported  by GAMBIA, INDIA, BURKINA FASO, SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, COLOMBIA,  VENEZUELA, BRAZIL, IRAN and KUWAIT said the Kyoto Protocol was  the first step in the review process. At COP-4 Parties would  examine the science to assess the adequacy of those commitments.  The group would draft a decision for the SBI.

The EU welcomed provisions in the Kyoto Protocol for a review at  MOP-2 and for initiating consideration of second period  commitments. Noting the requirement for increasingly global  participation, he said the EU was ready for discussions with all  Parties at COP- 4 and beyond, under FCCC Article 7.2, on regular  review of the Convention implementation. He noted FCCC provision  for non-Annex I Parties to opt for targets.

AUSTRALIA said all the scientific evidence indicates that  actions by Annex I countries alone would be insufficient. The US  noted findings that commitments are inadequate due to the small  number of Parties involved, and called for an item on COP-4's  agenda on voluntary commitments by non-Annex I Parties.

BURKINA FASO emphasized obligations related to developing  countries, specifically technology transfer. CHINA, supported by  HUNGARY, called for a review of FCCC implementation, not just  commitments. CANADA said future reviews should cover the effect  of actions by all Parties over time and that SBSTA should  provide scientific and technical information for such review.  HUNGARY noted many Annex I countries will meet their FCCC  obligations. He opposed giving up SBI consideration of the  review. SAUDI ARABIA recommended discussing non-Annex I Parties'  commitments only after the Kyoto Protocol comes into force.

SAUDI ARABIA, GAMBIA, COLOMBIA, IRAN and INDIA opposed any  consideration of voluntary commitments at COP-4. The CENTRAL  AFRICAN REPUBLIC called for a decision on the adequacy of Annex  I commitments before consideration of other country commitments.  SWITZERLAND said the second review should, inter alia, address  stabilization of GHG emissions by Annex I Parties, and, citing  Article 7.2 (a), said the issue of adequacy should not be  restricted to Annex I Parties. IRAN said it is natural to assess  new Annex I commitments.

The EU noted that the scientific knowledge that demonstrates the  inadequacy of commitments is clear. He noted that Article 7  discusses review of 'implementation' of the Convention, not just  targets. The US noted that the objectives of the Convention  cannot be achieved simply through Article 4.2(a) or (b). CHINA  insisted that Article 7's reference to 'the' Parties does not  include 'all' Parties and warned 'the North' that pushing too  hard risks complete failure. Consensus was reached not to  request SBSTA for more information yet. There was no consensus  on the Chair's proposal for a contact group on the issue.  Delegates agreed to wait for a forthcoming G-77 draft proposal  on the review.

On review of information and possible decisions under Article  4.2 (f) (amendments to the annexes), AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the  EU requested information on Turkey's approach to  responsibilities. The EU said all OECD countries should have  stated commitments. The US said any decision on review should  include a provision that it be a regular item on the COP agenda.  The Chair requested a draft decision.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVICE

On cooperation with relevant international organizations, the  MARSHALL ISLANDS sought clarification from IPCC regarding how  regional implications will be covered in the Third Assessment  Report(TAR). He supported establishing an interagency committee  on the climate agenda.

The US discussed the current capacity of the IPCC to undertake  further methodological work, the structure envisioned by IPCC to  accommodate the short- and long-term needs of the Parties, and  the expertise required to support work.

The US, AUSTRALIA and the EU urged Parties to prioritize  observatory systems and highlighted the deteriorating conditions  of the systems in use. The EU and UZBEKISTAN sought GEF  resources to assist developing countries and countries with  economies in transition in their observational work. The US,  supported by JAPAN and the EU, called for collaboration with  ICAO and IMO specifically in studies on bunker emissions.

Some Parties, including the MARSHALL ISLANDS, SAUDI ARABIA and  the G-77/CHINA, objected to the establishment of an  intergovernmental body on economic instruments since this work  is currently being done by IPCC Working Group 3, and suggested  that UNEP channel its resources and efforts through the IPCC.  UGANDA underscored the absence of climate information on Africa  and sought support for meteorological and hydrological services.  IRAN asked if IPCC would address the climatic impact of solar  cycles.

On Annex I national communications, the EU called for a  Secretariat report on the revisions proposed by Parties for  consideration at SBSTA-9 and COP-5. The MARSHALL ISLANDS said  stricter adherence to existing guidelines, rather than full- scale revision, may be needed. The US highlighted the importance  of inventories and sought revisions for guidelines on policies  and measures, national circumstances and technology transfer.  CANADA cited examples of inconsistencies in national  communications stemming from a lack of clarity in the guidelines  and said he would make a written submission. SWITZERLAND said  the Secretariat should record the difficulties cited by  countries and called for revision of in-depth review projects.

On non-Annex I communications, the Chair noted that SBI would  consider this item.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Reactions to the non-paper on emissions trading were mixed. Some  representatives of the submitting countries expressed  satisfaction with its terms and said they were glad to have a  tangible product for discussion. Other developed countries were  apparently surprised at the timing of the non-paper's  introduction and number of proponents. Some developing countries  were very hesitant to offer substantive comments until they  fully understood its implications.
