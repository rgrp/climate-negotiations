abstract: "The workshops on synergies and cooperation with other conventions  were held from 2-4 July 2003, at the Meripuisto Hotel in Espoo,  Finland. The workshops were organized by the Secretariat of the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The Subsidiary  Body for Implementation (SBI) workshop was convened in response to  a request made to the SBI by the seventh session of the Conference  of the Parties (COP), held in November 2001. The Subsidiary Body  for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) workshop was  convened in response to a request made to the UNFCCC Secretariat  by SBSTA-17, held in October-November 2002. Sixty-seven  representatives of governments, intergovernmental organizations  and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) attended the workshops."
---

The SBI workshop focused on possible synergies and joint action  with other multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs). It  convened in plenary sessions on Wednesday, 2 July, and in plenary  and working group sessions on Thursday morning, 3 July. On  Wednesday representatives of international organizations presented  different approaches to addressing synergies among MEAs, and  participants discussed synergies from the perspectives of  preserving biodiversity and combating desertification. On Thursday,  participants met in four working groups to discuss guiding  principles for achieving synergies, practical ways of achieving  synergies at the national level, the international community's  role in providing impetus to achieving synergies, and ways in  which the international community can enhance synergies at the  convention level. Participants later reconvened in the plenary to  identify such possible synergies and actions.

The SBSTA workshop addressed cooperation with other conventions.  It convened in plenary sessions on Thursday afternoon, 3 July, and  on Friday, 4 July. On Thursday, government representatives  provided an overview of national experiences in achieving  synergies between conventions, and the first of four panels on  cross-cutting areas under the UNFCCC, the Convention on Biological  Diversity (CBD) and the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD),  (the Rio conventions), convened to discuss technology transfer,  education and outreach, and capacity building. On Friday, panel  discussions were held on the cross-cutting themes of research and  systematic observation, reporting, and impacts and adaptation.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE WORKSHOPS ON SYNERGIES AND  COOPERATION

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  the world's environment, with negative impacts expected on human  health, food security, socioeconomic development, water and other  natural resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate  varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations  of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed. Despite some lingering  uncertainties, the majority of climate scientists believe that  prompt and precautionary action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Adopted in  1992, the UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at  stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to  avoid 'dangerous interference' with the climate system. The  greenhouse gases to be limited include methane, nitrous oxide and,  in particular, carbon dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21  March 1994, and currently has 188 Parties. In 1997, Parties  adopted the Kyoto Protocol that includes targets and timetables  for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

### SYNERGIES

Cooperation with MEAs is an important dimension to the  UNFCCC process, with cooperation with relevant international  organizations being a standing item on the SBSTA agenda. UNFCCC  Article 7.2(l) notes that the COP shall 'seek and utilize, where  appropriate, the services and cooperation of, and information  provided by, competent international organizations and  intergovernmental bodies,' and Article 8.2(e) provides that the  Secretariat shall 'ensure the necessary coordination with the  secretariats of other relevant international bodies.' Cooperation  between conventions was first considered by SBSTA-5, and from  SBSTA-10 onwards the substantive linkages between the Rio  conventions have been emphasized. At SBSTA-14, held in July 2001,  Parties discussed a proposal presented by the Chair of the CBD  Subsidiary Body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice  (SBSTTA) on potential areas of cooperation between the CBD and the  UNFCCC. Based on this proposal, the SBSTA endorsed the formation  of a Joint Liaison Group (JLG) between the CBD and UNFCCC  Secretariats, and invited the CCD Secretariat to participate in  the group. The aim of the JLG is to enhance coordination between  the secretariats of the Rio conventions and explore options for  further cooperation, such as a joint work plan. The SBSTA also  supported a request made by the CBD SBSTTA to the IPCC to develop  a technical paper on biodiversity and climate change and called on  the IPCC to consider relevant linkages between climate change,  biodiversity and desertification.

SBSTA-16, held in June 2002, took note of the JLG's first progress  report and noted that collaboration should facilitate synergies  towards national-level implementation of the Rio conventions.  SBSTA-17 agreed on the terms of reference of the SBSTA workshop  and recommended the adoption of decision 13/CP.8. The COP adopted  this decision at its eighth session, affirming the need for  enhanced cooperation between the Rio conventions, requesting the  SBSTA to continue cooperation with the CBD SBSTTA and the  Committee on Science and Technology of the CCD, and urging the JLG  to continue its efforts to enhance coordination between the Rio  conventions and their secretariats. Regarding guidance for the SBI  workshop, decision 5/CP.7 on the implementation of Article 4.8 and  4.8 (adaptation and mitigation), also requested the UNFCCC  Secretariat to organize a workshop on possible synergies and joint  action with other multilateral environmental conventions and  agreements, such as the CCD, and to report the results of the  workshop to COP-9.

# REPORT OF THE WORKSHOPS

Sirkka Hautojarvi, Secretary-General of Finland's Ministry of  Environment welcomed participants and said synergies between  conventions are central to ensuring the cost-effective allocation  of sparse financial resources. She stressed that work on  consumption and production patterns provides an overarching goal  that can facilitate convergence of conventions.

SBI Chair Daniela Stoycheva introduced the SBI workshop theme of  maximizing synergies between the Rio conventions and said that MEA  implementation is an important concern for the international  community.

SBSTA Chair Halldor Thorgeirsson said the SBSTA workshop aimed at  providing guidance on how best to realize synergies between  conventions and noted that its results would be used by the  Subsidiary Bodies in their work. He drew attention to a request to  promote cooperation between the subsidiary bodies of the Rio  conventions.

Janos Pasztor, UNFCCC Secretariat, noted past and present efforts  in promoting synergies between the Rio conventions and in  fostering dialogue among Parties to the conventions. He thanked  the Governments of Finland, Norway and Switzerland for funding the  workshops.

# SBI WORKSHOP

During the SBI workshop, participants convened in plenary and  working groups to discuss different approaches to addressing  synergies, consider synergies from the perspective of preserving  biodiversity and combating desertification, and identify possible  synergies and joint action with other MEAs.

# DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING SYNERGIES AMONG MEAS

During this session, held Wednesday morning, 2 July, and chaired  by Daniela Stoycheva, representatives of international  organizations gave presentations on different approaches to  addressing synergies among MEAs, and workshop participants  discussed such approaches.

### PRESENTATIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

Vijay Samnotra,  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), outlined UNEP's work  in improving the effectiveness of MEA implementation, including,  inter alia:harmonizing national reporting; developing compliance and enforcement guidelines that focus  on institutional coordination at national and international levels; building capacity, providing information and training; supporting national action plans; and developing a synthesis report on the implications of the  World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) for MEAs.

Noting a new project on achieving synergies between conventions in  Africa, he said that work on information and awareness raising can  be effective only if it addresses the Rio conventions jointly.  Responding to a participant who expressed concern over the process  of developing compliance and enforcement guidelines, he said that  the guidelines were adopted after extensive consultations with all  parties involved in implementation.

Khalid Hussain, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP),  stressed the importance of integrating climate change  considerations into poverty alleviation strategies and highlighted  the role of public-private partnerships in implementation. He said  that UNDP focuses on adaptation and mitigation measures within a  sustainable livelihoods framework. Hussain outlined UNDP's work  related to synergies between conventions, including an inter- agency paper on poverty and climate change, which explores  adaptation measures and addresses synergies between conventions at  all levels.

Avani Vaish, Global Environment Facility (GEF), outlined the GEF's  policy framework and its efforts to promote synergy and  harmonization of country-level action. He said that while the GEF  can provide feedback on the convention processes, it is the  responsibility of Parties to identify synergies and determine  approaches to their development. He highlighted some of the multi- focal activities, which the GEF continues to prioritize, noting  that substantial resources are allocated for this and for cross- cutting capacity building between 2004 and 2006. In response to a  question regarding GEF support to the conventions, he said that  there is no correspondence between the role of the GEF as a  financial mechanism and the allocation of resources, noting that  resource allocation is based on the focal areas.

Jerry Velasquez, United Nations University (UNU), outlined UNU's  Interlinkages Initiative that involves national and regional case  studies and analytical research on the role of interlinkages in  compliance and enforcement. Among lessons learned, he noted that  countries have varied responses and approaches to synergies,  institutional roles and responsibilities are often confusing and  conflicting, social challenges to synergies such as nepotism and  turf wars are enduring, and donor-driven activities are not always  coordinated. Velasquez stressed that synergies should not be  imposed but be demand-driven, should add value and support  sustainable development.

In her presentation, Annie Roncerel, United Nations Institute for  Training and Research (UNITAR), discussed the legal and  institutional prescriptions for the implementation of the Rio  conventions and outlined various UNITAR country-based initiatives.  She noted that UNITAR's efforts include comparing data needs for  implementation of conventions at the country level and stressed  the need for a data-sharing agreement between ministries. Roncerel  highlighted a UNITAR capacity-building effort, involving  implementing agencies in the formulation of National Capacity  Needs Self Assessment (NCSA) initiative.

Maria Socorro Manguiat, World Conservation Union (IUCN), noted  that approaches to synergies adopted by the IUCN have included  examining how the Rio conventions can synergize to contribute  towards the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) Programme of  Work. She said that IUCN aims to more effectively incorporate  climate change into future surveys of species survival and noted  that the IUCN Task Force on Climate Change, Vulnerable Communities  and Adaptation seeks to strengthen the role of ecosystem  management. Manguiat stated that the objectives of the IUCN  Climate Change Strategy include: informing governments and the  public about climate change impacts; promoting strategies to  reduce vulnerability and adapt to climate-related disasters; and  advancing environmentally-sound approaches to climate change  mitigation.

Nick Davidson, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, said the Ramsar  Convention commits Parties to wisely use wetlands, designate and  manage wetlands of international importance and cooperate at the  international level. He outlined cooperation between the Ramsar  Convention and other global and regional conventions and  agreements, including the Rio conventions, the Convention on  Migratory Species, the World Heritage Convention and the Barcelona  Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against  Pollution. He highlighted the global nature of most joint  activities and stressed the need to enhance national-level  collaboration. Davidson outlined global-scale challenges including  developing multi-convention work plans, analyzing common issues  and overlap of national implementation requirements, identifying  conflicting national requirements under different conventions, and  streamlining national reporting.

Carlos Corvalan, World Health Organization (WHO), noted an  existing gap between the work of the conventions and the health  sector. Calling for an ecological perspective to address public  health, he enumerated the negative health impacts of environmental  problems such as air and water pollution, ozone depletion,  persistent organic pollutants, biodiversity loss, desertification  and salinization. Corvalan stressed that there is great scope for  the WHO to work with the Rio conventions.

### DISCUSSION

Clarifying the purpose and mandate of the discussion,  Chair Stoycheva explained that while the SBSTA had provided a  clear mandate, the SBI's guidance was not precise. She said that  Parties would determine the use of the SBI workshop's results at a  later stage. SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson added that the synergy  discussions involve not only the Subsidiary Bodies but also the  convention secretariats that focus on the overall strategic level.

Janos Pasztor said the workshops were a forum for information  sharing and noted that it was not expected to make recommendations.  One participant expressed preference for presenting the results of  the workshops to the SBI and SBSTA as recommendations.

Participants then discussed the need for more synergies at the  international level, noting that there are over 500 existing MEAs.  One participant stressed the importance of identifying appropriate  governance of the synergy process and suggested broadening  participation in the JLG to secretariats of other conventions,  while another expressed skepticism over the potential overlaps  between existing processes.

Another participant underlined the need to distinguish between  synergies created for saving costs rather than synergies for  creating value. A third suggested defining indicators across  conventions, which could be used in the definition of core data  sets.

# BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY PERSPECTIVES

### KEYNOTE PRESENTATION

David Cooper, CBD, provided examples of the  CBD's cooperation with other conventions, including: the  establishment of joint work programmes with the CCD and the Ramsar  Convention; cooperation on work programmes with the FAO; and  formal recognition of the role of other agreements, including the  International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and  Agriculture and the International Plant Protection Convention. He  identified three categories of common interests where synergies  could be possible: biodiversity-linked measures to mitigate  climate change; adaptation measures to mitigate impacts of climate  change on biodiversity; and climate change adaptation measures.  Cooper noted that CBD COP-5 urged the UNFCCC to take all actions  to reduce effects of climate change on coral bleaching, called on  CBD Parties to explore how incentive measures under the UNFCCC and  Kyoto Protocol can support CBD objectives; and requested SBSTTA to  provide scientific advice to integrate biodiversity considerations  into the implementation of the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. He  concluded that: there are significant opportunities for climate  change mitigation and adaptation, while enhancing biodiversity  conservation; land use, land-use change and forestry activities  can play an important role in reducing net greenhouse gas  emissions; and that biodiversity conservation and maintenance of  ecosystem structure and function can contribute to adaptation  strategies.

### PANEL DISCUSSION

Outi Berghäll, Ministry of Environment, Finland,  emphasized the usefulness of the IPCC Technical Report on Climate  Change and Biodiversity and noted that the process of creating  interlinkages is being addressed under a more systematic framework.  Alfred Apau Oteng-Yeboah, Council for Scientific and Industrial  Research, Ghana, highlighted that the Rio conventions adopt  different approaches to fulfilling similar functions. Ines Verleye,  Federal Office for Consumer Protection, Public Heath and  Environment, Belgium, said that synergies should be developed  through both top-down and bottom-up approaches and stressed the  need for the JLG to engage in more specific actions to improve  information sharing. Stas Burgiel, Defenders of Wildlife, said  synergies are desirable within each convention as well as among  conventions. He stressed the need to harmonize terminology used in  the context of different conventions, and suggested broadening the  use of impact assessments, communicating the resulting information,  monitoring incentives, and using the knowledge of indigenous  communities.

In the ensuing plenary discussion, participants underscored the  difficulty of measuring coherence, highlighted the importance of  international institutions in this process, and noted the  challenge of adopting a broader approach to synergies. They noted  that synergies promote coherence and transparency and commended  that the SBI workshop's objective was to exchange information,  rather than streamline convention-specific issues into other  conventions.

# DESERTIFICATION PERSPECTIVES

### KEYNOTE PRESENTATION

Grégoire de Kalbermatten, CCD Deputy  Executive Secretary, spoke on promoting synergies at the national  level. He identified key driving forces for creating synergies,  including convergence of environment and development objectives,  and the search for commonalities and coalition building among  relevant actors. He said the CCD Secretariat aims at strengthening  institutional linkages and supporting country-driven initiatives  such as national workshops to strengthen coordination at local  levels and facilitating dialogue among key stakeholders. He noted  that Parties to the CCD have identified recommendations, including:integrating action programmes of environmental conventions; linking national action plans and national adaptation  programmes of action; establishing liaisons between focal points of the conventions  and GEF operational focal points through integrated project  development; developing technical and financial strategic alliances; and increasing the number of national synergy workshops.

Stressing the absence of a CCD financial mechanism and  highlighting the beneficial linkages between poverty reduction,  biodiversity and desertification, de Kalbermatten called for  making CCD projects eligible for GEF funding.

### PANEL DISCUSSION

Javier Gonzales, National Climate Change  Programme, Bolivia, stressed the importance of finding approaches  to respond to different conventions' needs. He underscored the  role of water management in addressing climate change and  desertification, the importance of institutional capacities, and  commitment from the international community to support national-  level synergy development.

Stressing the need to consider ecosystems other than forests,  Gisela Alonso Dominguez, Environmental Agency, Cuba, underlined  the role of coastal management in combating desertification,  addressing climate change and preserving biological diversity. She  underscored the role of traditional knowledge and South-South  cooperation, and added that while desertification was often  perceived as a local problem, it had ramifications for global  stability. She expressed hope that the GEF would be approved as  the CCD financial mechanism.

Halldor Thorgeirsson, speaking in his capacity as representative  of the Ministry of Environment, Iceland, outlined the impacts of  desertification in Iceland and the links between the Rio  conventions and their relation to different ecosystems. He  stressed the need for an ecosystem approach to defining synergies  and said synergies will not be possible if there are fundamental  differences in understanding the reality of the interlinkages.

Pierre Du Plessis, Namibia Committee on Climate Change, noted that  the UNFCCC focuses on the global, the CBD focuses largely on the  national and the CCD on the local level and said this is reflected  in the resources made available for their implementation. He said  that sustainable development is feasible only if it is compatible  with the market system. On institutional capacity building, he  stressed the importance of enhancing local capacities.

In the subsequent plenary discussion, participants stressed the  need to identify ways of obtaining international support to  implement existing national-level programmes. One participant  called for the adoption of concrete projects that address  commitments under different conventions.

# POSSIBLE SYNERGIES AND JOINT ACTION WITH OTHER MEAS

On Wednesday, 3 July, participants convened in four parallel  working groups to stimulate a more free-flowing discussion on  several key questions outlined by the SBI workshop Chair, relating  to possible synergies and joint action with MEAs. The working  groups included participants from developing and developed  countries, and representatives from intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations, and addressed an identical set of  questions. The results of the working groups were reported to the  plenary, where discussion continued. The questions raised in the  working groups, participants' responses and the resulting plenary  discussion are set out below.

WHAT PRINCIPLES SHOULD GUIDE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE SYNERGIES?  Participants identified sustainable development as the overall  guiding principle, together with transparency, subsidiarity and  efficient resource use, and highlighted operational principles,  including: capacity building, compliance, coherence, and  coordination. Participants underscored the need to adopt an  ecosystem approach, avoid duplication of activities, and ensure  the environmental integrity of the Rio conventions while  maintaining their legal distinctiveness. They also stressed that  synergies should contribute to efficient and effective  implementation of the Rio conventions, add value, be implemented  at appropriate levels and promote cooperation. Participants agreed  that while opportunities for synergies exist at the local level,  the international community needs to build national-level  awareness and capacity. Noting that current efforts to create  synergies are compartmentalized by conventions, one participant  stressed that the search for synergies should be problem-driven  and not convention-driven.

WHAT ARE PRACTICAL WAYS TO ACHIEVE SYNERGIES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL?  Participants agreed on the importance of:involving high-level politicians and stakeholders; balancing bottom-up and top-down approaches; incorporating synergies into national strategies; facilitating communication between national focal points for  different conventions and agencies responsible for their  implementation; using the ecosystem approach at the national level; and establishing and strengthening clearing-house mechanisms.

Participants underscored the importance of incentives to focus on  the long-term goals of the Rio conventions, rather than on more  immediate objectives. They agreed that different approaches are  needed at different levels, and that local efforts and practices  need to be identified in a gradual and incremental way. They also  stressed the importance of recognizing and creating enabling  environments for improving donor funding, developing strong legal  frameworks, building political will, and raising awareness.

WHAT ROLE SHOULD THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY PLAY IN PROVIDING  IMPETUS TO ACHIEVE SYNERGIES? Participants noted the importance of  learning by doing, and said that the international community  should play a catalytic rather than a prescriptive role, and  provide technical advice. They emphasized the need for  international funding for national-level synergy initiatives. Some  suggested that partnerships be created between international  agencies with similar mandates, and called on the UNEP  Environmental Management Group to address synergies. Others noted  the need to identify best practices, encourage regional solutions,  develop local expertise, and optimize reporting requirements.  Participants identified bodies and institutions, which should be  involved in synergies, including regional organizations, the UN  Commission on Sustainable Development, and the UNEP Governing  Council.

HOW CAN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ENHANCE SYNERGIES AND  INTERLINKAGES AT THE CONVENTION LEVEL? Participants agreed on the  importance of developing specific terms of reference for the JLG.  They also suggested promoting national-level synergy workshops and  convening side events on synergies at Subsidiary Body meetings and  underscored the need for coherence between convention-specific  scientific processes. They suggested learning from issues where  consensus had been reached under other conventions, while others  cautioned that the applicability and relevance of concepts and  issues may differ.

### PLENARY DISCUSSION

Facilitator Kilaparti Ramakrishna, Woods Hole  Research Center, noted that recommendations emerging from the  working group discussions could be grouped into intergovernmental  mechanisms, interagency coordination, national-level cooperation  among focal points, and other interventions. He said that despite  existing studies and agency activities, progress on achieving  synergies is weak.

One participant underscored that the search for synergies is a  rational approach to efficiency and not a hidden agenda to reduce  development assistance. Another stressed the importance of  comprehensive approaches to convention implementation, calling for  developing concrete policy projects and more specific cooperation  among COPs. One participant stressed the need to focus on synergy  activities at the national level, and, referring to a UNITAR  project, said that the primary role for the international  community is to promote national-level integration and  coordination among focal points.

Participants noted the need for a common framework for the  ecosystem approach. They emphasized that governments have ultimate  responsibility for synergy creation and underscored the importance  of coordination. In response to a question on how synergies with  non-environmental conventions can minimize conflict with  environmental issues, one participant stressed the need for  mutually supportive synergies between all conventions and  agreements. The working group rapporteurs emphasized  recommendations that the value-added of synergies be long term,  representatives of lending agencies be involved in future  discussions on synergies, and that MEAs have a legal standing  similar to that of the World Trade Organization.

# SBI CHAIR'S CONCLUSIONS

Summarizing the key points of the discussions, Chair Daniela  Stoycheva said that synergies have an important role to play in  furthering sustainable development and noted that they add value.  She said synergies should be built at local and international  levels and noted that the SBI workshop's findings will be made  available to the next session of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Bodies.

# SBSTA WORKSHOP

Participants convened in plenary sessions for the SBSTA workshop,  chaired by SBSTA Chair Halldor Thorgeirsson, to hear presentations  on national experiences in achieving synergies and to discuss  cross-cutting issues under the Rio conventions, including:  technology transfer, education and outreach, and capacity building;  research and systematic observation; reporting; and impacts and  adaptation.

On Thursday afternoon, 3 July, Chair Thorgeirsson opened the SBSTA  workshop, saying that the workshop aimed to prepare guidance to  national focal points, enhance cooperation and coordination  between focal points, and identify options for increased  cooperation. He outlined the legal basis for cooperation between  the Rio conventions and reviewed relevant SBSTA activities. He  noted that cooperation between conventions was first taken up by  SBSTA-5, and that from SBSTA-10 onwards, the substantive linkages  between the UNFCCC, CBD and CCD were emphasized. He noted that the  SBSTA considered this issue in detail for the first time at its  14th session, where it stressed the need for enhanced cooperation  and the importance of coordination at the national level, endorsed  the formation of the JLG, and supported the CBD SBSTTA request to  the IPCC to compile a technical paper on interlinkages between  biodiversity and climate change. He summarized key conclusions  reached by the SBSTA, including that synergies be based on  coordination and cooperation, cooperation be carried out at the  national level, and that areas of cooperation include technology  transfer, education and outreach, reporting, and impacts and  adaptation.

# PRESENTATIONS ON NATIONAL EXPERIENCES

Suhel al-Janabi, German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ),  spoke on synergies and coordination in GTZ projects in Mauritania,  China and Tunisia. He said that early warning systems,  identification of vulnerability indicators, and economic risk  assessments represent linkages between the UNFCCC and the CCD. On  interlinkages between the UNFCCC and the CBD, he noted that the  ecosystem approach adopted by the CBD can be useful for the UNFCCC.  He recommended increased cooperation on the impacts of adaptation  measures and urged the GEF to link thematic areas. Al-Janabi  stressed that local-level action should address the Rio  conventions simultaneously, taking into consideration poverty  alleviation, economic and social development, combating  environmental degradation, and developing education and health  policies.

Virginia Sena, Ministry of Environment, Uruguay, stated that the  National Capacity Self Assessment (NCSA) project in Uruguay builds  the capacity of national institutions. Sena said the anticipated  benefits of the NCSA include efficient resource use, enhanced  national domestic awareness and knowledge about the Rio  conventions, and greater opportunities for public participation in  these activities.

Gisela Alonso Dominguez, Environmental Agency, Cuba, provided an  overview of Cuba's natural resources, environmental problems, and  domestic environmental laws and institutions. Dominguez drew  attention to Cuba's Committee on the Environment, which oversees  policy actions on all MEAs, and whose principal goals include  integral environmental management, pollution reduction, enterprise  management, and environmental education. She outlined a  hydrographical basins programme that integrates policies on soil  degradation, deforestation, waste, water management, biodiversity,  natural disasters, climate studies, health, education and  employment.

Outi Berghäll, Ministry of the Environment, Finland, said that to  achieve synergies, Finland has to focus on the regional level and  on forest owners in particular. She noted that Finland addresses  synergies through the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change,  the EU institutions and the National Council of Sustainable  Development. As a concrete example of an integrated approach, she  highlighted the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment Project, which is  a comprehensive assessment of climate change and its impacts on  the Arctic Region.

Rawson Yonazi, Division of Environment, Tanzania, presented an  overview of the national efforts to address UNFCCC provisions on  adaptation, technology transfer, and education and outreach.  Describing the formal and informal processes of institutional  coordination, he noted that the Vice President's office is the  national focal point for the GEF, the Rio conventions, matters  relating to the UN Commission on Sustainable Development and  poverty alleviation initiatives. He noted that most of the  conventions are implemented separately by sectoral ministries.  Yonazi said the main challenge in the work on synergies is  mobilizing resources for national synergy workshops, enhancing the  focal points' capacities, mainstreaming conventions into national  policies, generating information and establishing national  databases.

Dora Kulauzov, Ministry of Environment and Water, Hungary,  outlined the Hungarian experience in reinforcing synergies among  the Rio conventions. She listed a number of relevant laws,  programmes, and strategies, and discussed environmental, policy,  financial, and institutional aspects of synergistic approaches.  Kulauzov noted the need to, inter alia: take into account the  impacts of policies on all ecosystems, systematically observe the  state of the environment, conduct integrated assessments of  proposed policies, strengthen the scientific base of decision  making, and effectively use financial resources.

# PANELS ON CROSS-CUTTING AREAS UNDER THE RIO CONVENTIONS

Following keynote presentations, panels convened to discuss the  following cross-cutting areas under the Rio conventions:  technology transfer, education and outreach, and capacity building;  research and systematic observation; reporting; and impacts and  adaptation.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH, AND CAPACITY BUILDING

Keynote Presentation: Jerry Velasquez, UNU, outlined key  challenges in implementing the Rio conventions with regard to  technology transfer, capacity building, and education, awareness  and training. He highlighted the need to increase awareness,  mainstream the conventions in national strategies, enhance  capacities to translate the convention provisions into actions and  establish information systems to support the fulfillment of  countries' obligations. He drew attention to linkages between the  Rio conventions relating to approaches adopted to achieve their  goals, the nature of their activities, and the information,  monitoring and reporting requirements. Velasquez highlighted  similar processes and mechanisms under the conventions relating to  technology transfer, capacity building, education, training and  awareness. He noted that the main challenges in addressing these  include the lack of awareness, the need to bridge the local and  global interface, involvement of all stakeholders, creation of  incentive systems and mobilization of technologies and financial  resources.

###     Panel Discussion

Joyceline Goco, Environmental Management Bureau,  Philippines, agreed that achieving synergies should focus on  national-level actions and stressed the role of the international  community in increasing institutional capacity and technology  transfer, developing education materials, generating and sharing  information, and raising awareness.

Alfred Apau Oteng-Yeboah, Council for Scientific and Industrial  Research, Ghana, noted that technology transfer can be North-South,  South-South, South-North and North-North, and stressed that it can  be effective only if there is an enabling environment to receive  and use the technology. He said that MEAs can learn from non-MEA  experiences, such as UNESCO's work on outreach and awareness- raising.

In the subsequent discussion, one participant drew attention to  the IPCC Special Report on Technology Transfer and encouraged  relevant parties to consult it. Several participants drew  attention to developed-country projects and initiatives on  technology transfer. One participant highlighted the use of NGO  networks that exist within the framework of each of the Rio  conventions in creating public awareness. He referred to the role  of the Global Biodiversity Forum in creating dialogue between  different stakeholders.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Keynote Presentation: William  Westermeyer, Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Secretariat,  emphasized the importance of high-quality, long-term observation  data to address the needs of the Rio conventions, and outlined the  GCOS strategies and global networks for observing atmospheric,  oceanic and terrestrial systems. Based on past experience, he  recommended, inter alia: adhering to the GCOS Climate Monitoring  Principles for in situ and satellite systems; improving data  exchange and availability; and building capacity and improving  observation systems by creating a donor fund and developing a  global observation framework for defining regional impacts. He  stressed the need for global-level initiatives and for a regional  approach to observation and implementation.

###     Panel Discussion

Outi Berghäll, Ministry of Environment, Finland,  stressed the need for: policy-relevant cross-sectoral research;  dialogue between policy makers and researchers at national and  international levels; and the representation of developing country  views in developed countries. Referring to the technical and  policymakers' summaries of the IPCC Third Assessment Report and  similar research projects, she said they should be tailored to the  needs of policymakers at various levels.

Klas Österberg, Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, presented  an overview of Swedish forest monitoring activities related to the  Rio conventions. He outlined the Swedish policies for nature  conservation and described two initiatives where the same  inventories are used for different purposes under the UNFCCC and  CBD.

Underscoring the importance of a clear definition of synergies,  Jun Zhao, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, China, noted the  differences between synergies and cooperation. He underlined the  need for research cooperation at national and international levels.

Awadi Abi Egbare, Togo, said that West African countries lack  observation equipment, data and capacity, and called for bilateral  and multilateral cooperation in this area. He stressed the  importance of data for socioeconomic and environmental impact  assessments, policy formulation and development planning.

In the ensuing plenary discussion, a participant said that  observation capacities relating to the Rio conventions are  disparate and expressed regret at the shortage of donor help and  financial resources. Participants underscored the need for more  specific core sets of biodiversity data and indicators and for  multidisciplinary analysis of data at the country level.

Summarizing the panel discussion, Chair Thorgeirsson noted the  considerable overlap between the needs of the Rio conventions,  insufficient observation systems, inadequate policy-relevant data,  and the need for an international mechanism to devise standards  for establishing terrestrial observation systems.

### REPORTING

Keynote Presentation: Vijay Samnotra, UNEP, outlined  UNEP's activities on harmonizing information management and  reporting for biodiversity-related treaties. He highlighted  potential obstacles to harmonization, including:limited understanding of the link between focal points at the  national level; jurisdictional conflicts between focal points; inconsistent national-level reporting formats; limited international-level funding and human resources; and Parties' different economic, legislative, social,  administrative and statistical systems.

He outlined ways to overcome these barriers, including a clearer  understanding of the conventions' objectives and benefits at all  levels, enhanced multilateral cooperation and adoption of tested  procedures for further implementation. Stressing differences  between streamlining and harmonization, he said benefits of  harmonization include improved awareness of national obligations,  identification of gaps in national legislation and enhanced  linkages between international monitoring agencies.

###     Panel Discussion

Diann Black-Layne, Environment Division, Antigua  and Barbuda, noted the different reporting requirements under the  Rio conventions, emphasizing the varying degrees of difficulty in  report preparation. She underscored the need to mainstream reports,  noting that they contribute to fulfilling convention-specific  commitments. She said that they also serve as educational material  for the Caribbean region.

Ines Verleyne, Federal Office for Consumer Interests, Public  Health and Environment, Belgium, stressed the need for a more  practical approach to synergies, which includes the identification  of potential conflicts. She proposed requesting the Rio  conventions' secretariats to identify overlaps between reports and  their potential synergistic uses. Verleyne said as the reports  influence project funding, they should be compiled along with the  financing institutions.

Dora Kulauzov, Ministry of Environment and Water, Hungary, said  that institutional cooperation on reporting in Hungary is  constrained by the lack of data, duplication of efforts, and  limited exchange of data between domestic agencies. She said the  different deadlines for report submission under MEAs affect the  comparability of the data and reduce domestic interagency  coordination.

Álvaro José Rodríguez, Ministry of Environment, Colombia,  supported the need to streamline the reports' contents and  synchronize their submission timing, but noted that simultaneous  reporting would burden national institutions. He highlighted his  country's lack of success in:integrating convention implementation into policy development; coordinating national policies with regional and local-level  policy; building capacity with practical applicability; and harmonizing information systems.

José Romero, Swiss Agency for the Environment, Forests and  Landscapes, noted that there is a need to, inter alia: bridge the  gap between different conventions through reporting; harmonize  reporting and report-timing for MEAs; and improve reporting on  issues relevant to desertification.

In the ensuing plenary discussion, one participant commented on  the need for improved reporting guidelines and cautioned against  over-harmonizing reporting. Another suggested that report  harmonization could reduce duplication of efforts. Another stated  that there may be potential for conflict of interests between  those preparing and relying on the reports for funding, and those  advocating harmonization. He questioned the absence of the CCD in  the UNEP report harmonization exercise.

One participant stressed the need for strategic use of the reports  and called for 'preventive reporting,' whereby policies and  measures proposed under one convention are analyzed in the context  of related conventions. Another participant said that while  interlinkages between conventions are desirable, reporting  requirements remain specific to environmental issues that are  distinct from each other, and noted the funding implications.  Avani Vaish, GEF, informed participants that GEF provides  financial assistance to countries for assessing the state of their  knowledge.

Summarizing the panel discussion, Chair Thorgeirsson stressed the  relevance of reports at the national and international levels. He  highlighted the difference between streamlining and harmonizing,  the former facilitating reporting and the latter making data  comparable. Thorgeirsson emphasized that reports contribute to  identifying potential synergies and conflicts, and stressed the  need for building national reporting capacity.

### IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION

Keynote Presentation: Avani Vaish, GEF,  provided an overview of the GEF's work on climate change  adaptation. He said that the GEF addresses adaptation as a cross- sectoral issue, and that its actions are both guided and  constrained by the COP's guidance. He said the GEF has addressed  adaptation through strengthening enabling environments including  the preparation of initial national communications and by  incorporating adaptation components into existing GEF projects.

###     Panel discussion

Susan Edwards, Ministry of Agriculture and  Forestry, New Zealand, presented an overview of forestry policies  in New Zealand. She stressed that these policies integrate  biodiversity, forestry and climate change concerns. Among lessons  learned, she listed the need for cooperation in achieving multiple  objectives related to climate change and biodiversity, and the  importance of developing good working relations among focal points.

Javier Gonzales, National Climate Change Programme, Bolivia,  highlighted the challenge of applying lessons from successful  local experiences to regional and subregional policies. He  stressed the need for domestic institutional frameworks that  provide market incentives for maintaining environmental services.  He also noted the importance of enhancing local scientific  capacity and using traditional knowledge to facilitate adaptation.

Noting that climate change will have an impact on biological  diversity, Benoit Gauthier, Department of Foreign Affairs and  International Trade, Canada, underscored the need to devise  conservation strategies to address climate change impacts. He also  outlined climate change impacts on cultural diversity and stressed  the need for capacity building to facilitate adaptation, using  indigenous knowledge systems.

Karine Hertzberg, Norwegian Pollution Control Authority, presented  an overview of the work on impacts and adaptation in Norway. She  suggested that the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report include a section  on areas where synergies can be developed between the Rio  conventions.

Pierre de Plessis, Namibia Committee for Climate Change,  emphasized the role of indigenous technical knowledge. Drawing  attention to the fact that Namibia was implementing a rights-based  approach to land degradation, he said this could classify as an  adaptation activity. He expressed concern over implementing  adaptation in the context of a globalized economy and stressed the  role of public-private partnerships.

In the ensuing plenary discussion, one participant said that  acceptable levels of impacts depend in part on the cost of  adaptation. Another noted that enhancing ecosystem resilience is  important for all MEAs, and stressed the need to develop effective  and rapid adaptation tools and decision-making procedures.

Chair Thorgeirsson summarized the discussion, highlighting:adaptation is a cross-sectoral issue because of the multiple  and diverse impacts of climate change; actions on adaptation can accrue significant benefits for a  variety of socioeconomic sectors; there is a need to strengthen adaptive capacity; and regional assessments and regional specificity in global  assessments are important.

He said climate change might render local traditional knowledge  that was accumulated under old climatic conditions irrelevant.

# CLOSING SESSION

Chair Thorgeirsson opened the closing session and underscored the  importance of regional assessment information. One participant  stressed the need for better information management, noting that a  gap exists between the international, regional and  local/indigenous knowledge levels. The usefulness of the CCD's  thematic regional and subregional networks for identification of  synergies was noted.

On the conventions' reporting requirements, several participants  stressed the need for communication between all focal points,  including the GEF focal points. One participant suggested  requesting the JLG or the Rio conventions' secretariats to  facilitate the production of joint information and to facilitate  the wide distribution of the conventions' reports.

Several participants supported the idea of developing a checklist  for identifying opportunities for synergies and proposed  harmonizing the reporting process as a way of developing the  checklist. One participant expressed reservations over  establishing a checklist of activities and suggested instead  listing scheduled work products. Some noted that the development  of synergies was an intense process and urged undertaking a  practical approach that starts with selected thematic areas such  as forests and land degradation and involves all stakeholders.

In summarizing the SBSTA workshop discussions, Chair Thorgeirsson  highlighted the need to determine ways to facilitate information  exchange on outcomes and products. He noted that the consideration  of synergies must be mainstreamed, and appreciated the valuable  input from different convention secretariats and international  organizations to the SBSTA workshop. Regarding the report of the  meeting, Thorgeirsson noted that the proceedings of the workshop  will be contained in the Earth Negotiations Bulletin and will be  accessible to all convention focal points.

Janos Pasztor said the official SBI and SBSTA workshop reports  would be available on the UNFCCC website and would be disseminated  through the formal channels of the Executive Secretary. He thanked  the Government of Finland and participants, and closed the  workshops at 5:20 pm.
