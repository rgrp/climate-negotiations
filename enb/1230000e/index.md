# AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13 PANEL DISCUSSION

Chair Patrick Szell (United Kingdom) introduced the panel on  compliance procedures (Article 13) sponsored by the Ad Hoc  Group on Article 13 (AG-13). The ILO emphasized non- confrontational procedures to encourage compliance with ILO  conventions, as well as the occasional use of adversarial  procedures to deal with complaints against States that have  not ratified specific conventions. The WTO said failure to  implement changes as directed by a panel can lead to a right  to 'retaliate.' The International Instruments Branch of the  Centre for Human Rights said the primary aim of  implementation procedures is to assist governments. A quasi- judicial process is also available. The Secretariat of the  Basel Convention said an Open-ended Ad Hoc Committee for  implementation has been established to examine annual  reports. Any Party can report a breach of obligations by  another. The Montreal Protocol Implementation Committee  Chair said the Montreal Protocol views traditional methods  of bipolar dispute settlement as not sufficient.

The Ministry for Environmental Protection and Nuclear Safety  (Ukraine) described the difficulty of complying with the  Montreal Protocol following the breakup of the Soviet Union,  pointing out that the role of the Implementation Committee  of the Montreal Protocol is to catalyze compliance with the  treaty, but in a cooperative and non-confrontational manner.

In the ensuing discussion on compliance mechanisms, reports  by NGOs highlighted the importance of: a modest start  followed by growth and adjustment over time; a standing  committee with a clear mandate; handling specific cases;  nonconfrontational procedures; data reporting; and a role  for NGOs in filing submissions on noncompliance. Summarizing  the results of a survey distributed by AG-13, an NGO  representative reported responses emphasizing a process  which: is facilitative and non-confrontational; does not  undermine the authority of the COP; and is developed early.

During questions and answers participants addressed: the  utility of incorporating 'stringent measures' even where  they are not regularly implemented; the WTO's move to an  'automaticity-based' system to avert unilateralism and  protect weaker parties; the limitations of an adversarial  trade-related model for FCCC; and procedural tactics  undermining system confidence and the need for automaticity  at all stages of procedures. Additional comments  highlighted: adequate technical capacity to meet reporting  requirements; cooperative and nonjudicial mechanisms; and  the wording of Article 13, which was left deliberately vague  as Parties could not agree on a dispute resolution  mechanism.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY ON IMPLEMENTATION

The third session of the SBI was chaired by Mohamed Ould El  Ghaouth (Mauritania). Delegates recommended that the COP  take note of several reports on procedural matters relating  to establishment of the permanent secretariat. ANTIGUA AND  BARBUDA, on behalf of the G77/CHINA, inquired about FCCC  liaison arrangements in New York in addition to those in  Geneva. FRANCE questioned the cost, and the matter was  referred to informal consultations. The meeting then  considered a report on legal arrangements for the  secretariat in Germany (FCCC/CP/1996/6/Add.1). FRANCE called  for more time to study the document and the Chair agreed to  facilitate informal discussions.

The Chair then introduced Agenda Item 7(b) on income and  budget performance, and resource deployment for 1997  (FCCC/CP/1996/7 and Add.1). The Secretariat summarized Add.1  on the financial performance of the FCCC, contributions and  expenditures in 1996, and the forecast for 1996-97. There  will be an annual payment of DM1.5 million per year from the  German Government and lower staff costs arising from  relocation to Bonn. Thirty-five Parties have paid  contributions in full and expenditures are in line with COP- 1 estimates. Additional requirements for 1996 amount to  US$158,000, and US$867,400 for 1997. Germany will contribute  an additional DM3.5 million annually to a special fund.  Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar noted that no  additional core resources are being sought for 1997. He  proposed a revision of the capital reserve level, up from  8.3% of the core budget to 15%. Responding to questions from  the US and the EU, the Secretariat said budgeting beyond  1997 will be addressed at the next session of the SBI. No  activity is given greater priority than in-depth reviews.  JAPAN questioned the proposal to revise the level of working  capital reserves. The Chair invited delegations to interact  with their capitals to resolve the issue. The SBI then  recommended approval of the programme of work for 1996-1997  (FCCC/SBI/1996/11).

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

The Chair noted that current positions in SBSTA were  difficult to accept, but expressed confidence in the spirit  of collaboration. When reviewing the agenda, the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION proposed amending the agenda to note the 'use of'  scientific assessments. VENEZUELA, supported by KUWAIT,  proposed producing a written report along with their  decisions, because an oral report could leave some things  unclear. The Chair said SBSTA should determine whether a  written report was necessary after deliberations.

The Secretariat introduced documents on the consideration of  the SAR of the IPCC (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/7/Rev.1) and three  addenda. He also noted the Report of the second session  (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/8). He highlighted two paragraphs, one  noting that some delegations had drawn attention to specific  findings, the other that some delegations found it premature  for SBSTA to highlight specifics.

Bert Bolin, Chair of the IPCC, said SBSTA should not  elaborate on the conclusions, but discuss the implications  with regard to action and possible targets. He noted the  importance of considering the different views on the SAR and  said delegates should not try to extract and agree on  simplifications, but should give advice regarding specific  measures.

The EU recalled that the preliminary views of delegations  concerning the SAR were recorded in the report of the last  meeting. He urged the COP to endorse the SAR and accept it  as the most comprehensive assessment of available scientific  information on climate change. Many also expressed support  for the SAR and made specific comments, including the US,  CANADA, ARGENTINA, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, COLOMBIA, NEW  ZEALAND, BANGLADESH, NORWAY, FIJI, URUGUAY, MAURITIUS,  JAPAN, BENIN, MYANMAR, BULGARIA and GREENPEACE. SAMOA, on  behalf of AOSIS, supported adoption of the SAR and noted the  conclusion that SIDS are among the most vulnerable to  climate change. This was seconded by MICRONESIA, the  MALDIVES, the MARSHALL ISLANDS and NIUE.

COSTA RICA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said a clear  mechanism must be established for the use of scientific  information, and noted that SBSTA should not be selective  when presenting information. He said that the SAR clearly  indicates the negative potential impacts on developing  countries. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said the SAR lacks a  quantitative assessment of the permissible level of impact  on the climate system. SAUDI ARABIA, OMAN, KUWAIT, UAE,  VENEZUELA, IRAN, NIGERIA and AUSTRALIA said it was premature  to make recommendations given the lack of certainty in the  SAR data. POLAND said that SBSTA should determine how  scientific information may be utilized for the FCCC.

INDIA said SBSTA should not base its recommendations solely  on the SAR and suggested the IPCC examine the effects of  climate change in non-Annex I countries caused by  extraterritorial activities and natural climate variability  in greater detail. The Chair reminded delegates that SBSTA  is mandated to advise the COP and decision-makers based on  findings of the IPCC, but may ask for and consider  additional information. PAKISTAN cautioned against the use  of global generalizations and recommended that the SAR be  amended to reflect regional differences in climate change.

The PHILIPPINES, supported by INDONESIA and BRAZIL, said the  SAR should be used as a comprehensive whole and not  selectively. The heightened vulnerability of developing  countries and equity concerns should be further considered.  SWITZERLAND agreed the SAR should not be used selectively  and that low cost abatement measures, even beyond 'no  regrets', should be taken immediately. SRI LANKA cautioned  against oversimplification of the SAR findings, stating that  ambiguities have resulted from the use of 'extreme'  numerical values.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, supported by ZIMBABWE, called for  an addendum to the SAR noting SBSTA's comments. KOREA  suggested that the IPCC try to work more economically by  avoiding duplication of work and enhanced data sharing.  GEORGIA called for analysis of national and regional  impacts, saying mitigation measures would not otherwise be  possible. The IPCC CHAIR noted the need to distinguish  between scientific assessments and the policies arising out  of them and recommended the COP set tentative emission  targets.

MEXICO, supported by KOREA, said climate change must be  tackled on the basis of common but differentiated  responsibilities. CHINA called for distillation of the SAR  to a form that could be more useful to the SBSTA in making  recommendations, otherwise the SAR should be submitted in  its entirety to the COP. The IPCC Chair reminded delegates  that while recommendations should be based on scientific  information, they are ultimately political judgements that  the IPCC is not equipped to make.

Delegates began consideration of Agenda Item 4(a) (national  communications of Annex I Parties). The Secretariat  introduced the document on possible revision of the  guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/9). JAPAN, supported by the US,  proposed a separate informal session to discuss the revised  guidelines. CHINA, supported by INDIA, highlighted the  importance of technology transfer and called for including  language in the body of the guidelines. The EU approved  extending the minimum information required and recommended  that the revised guidelines include direction for preferred  timetables. POLAND and HUNGARY said second reports are being  prepared and changing guidelines will lead to delays.  SWITZERLAND proposed discussing amendments on a paragraph by  paragraph basis. AUSTRALIA highlighted performance  indicators.

# IN THE CORRIDORS I

COP President Chen Chimutengwende is reported to have begun  informal consultations on the unresolved Rules of Procedure.  One delegate suggested a resolution in which developed  countries relax their requirements for voting on financial  issues in return for cooperation from the oil producing  states.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

The non-Annex I country of Morocco was seen in the corridors  explaining that it was Monaco, not Morocco, that had applied  for Annex I status, as erroneously reported in ENB  yesterday.
