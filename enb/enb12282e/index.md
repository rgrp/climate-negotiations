# SBI

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM (UNFCCC)

Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF):  On Tuesday morning, Philip Weech, Secretariat, noted that  discussions on operationalizing the SCCF would proceed based on  the draft text from Annex I of the report of SBI 22  (FCCC/SBI/2005/10).

###     GEF Report to the COP

Richard Hosier, GEF, summarized the GEF  report to the COP (FCCC/SBI/2005/3). Commenting on financial  matters, the Philippines, for the G-77/CHINA, underlined 'grave  concerns' on matters relating to the financial mechanism,  questioning whether the GEF Council had a mandate to decide that  the World Bank will be the trustee for the Adaptation Fund, or  whether the World Bank consequently has the authority to establish  a Multi-Donor Trust Fund to disburse funding. She also expressed  concern that the new GEF Resource Allocation Framework (RAF) will  not enhance transparency and could make it harder to  operationalize the Adaptation Fund, and that co-financing  requirements present a barrier to LDCs and SIDS accessing funds.  AOSIS, with others, added that the Adaptation Fund should be  administered by the COP rather than by the GEF/World Bank.  BANGLADESH said the COP, and not just the GEF Council, should  determine the allocation of the LDC Fund. JAPAN, opposed by  TANZANIA, URUGUAY and others, said any discussion on capacity  building related to the GEF report should be included under the  agenda item on the financial mechanism rather than under the item  on capacity building related to the Convention.

###     Implementation of Decision 5/CP.8

Concerning implementation of  decision 5/CP.8 (developing countries' investment needs), the  Secretariat introduced a document outlining information relevant  to investment needs of developing countries for fulfilling their  UNFCCC commitments (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.7). The G-77/CHINA said this  information should be used to achieve a fair and balanced review  of the Convention's financial mechanism. A contact group on the  financial mechanism was established.

### CAPACITY BUILDING UNDER THE UNFCCC

The issue of capacity building  under the Convention was referred to a contact group.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9 (ADVERSE EFFECTS)

Buenos Aires  Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures: Delegates  discussed implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9, with SAUDI  ARABIA and others highlighting the value of workshops and expert  meetings on response measures and economic diversification.  TUVALU, opposed by the US, said adaptation and response measures  should be kept separate. Parties decided to follow the timetable  for expert meetings and reporting set out in decision 1/CP.10.

###     Least Developed Countries

Paul Desanker (Malawi) briefed  delegates on the work of the LDC Expert Group and progress with  the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). A contact  group was established.

### ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS

Budget  Issues: Parties decided that the Secretariat, in consultation with  interested Parties, will draft conclusions on budget performance  for the biennium 2004-2005. On the programme budget for 2006-2007,  Parties decided to take note of revisions to the Secretariat's  work programme (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.6).

###     Institutional Linkages

Masao Nakayama (Micronesia) will chair a  contract group to prepare a draft decision on continuing the  institutional linkage between the Secretariat and the UN.

###     Privileges and Immunities

The contact group chaired by Nakayama  will also draft a decision on privileges and immunities for  individuals serving on bodies established under the Kyoto  Protocol.

### REVIEW OF THE SECRETARIAT

Parties decided that conclusions on  guidance to the Secretariat will be prepared by the Secretariat in  consultation with interested Parties.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM (KYOTO PROTOCOL)

Adaptation Fund: The G-77/CHINA emphasized that for developing countries, having the GEF  and World Bank acting as trustee would not be the best option for  managing the Fund. TUVALU and BANGLADESH urged the Fund to focus  on concrete projects, and said COP/MOP should exercise its  authority in administrating the Fund. CANADA said the Fund could  serve as a catalyst for leveraging other resources.

###     Guidance to the GEF

Following introductory comments by the  Secretariat, delegates agreed to form a contact group that would  draft COP/MOP decisions on guidance to the GEF and on the  Adaptation Fund. This issue will be addresssed by the contact  group on the financial mechanism.

###     Capacity Building under the Protocol

SBI Coordinator Janos  Pasztor introduced this item (FCCC/SBI/2005/Misc.3 and Add.1).  JAPAN stressed capacity building as a tool to create an enabling  environment for JI and CDM.

# SBSTA

Chair Benrageb reported back to SBSTA on consultations regarding  the agenda, noting lack of agreement on an item on SIDS. He added  that IPCC's report on carbon dioxide capture and storage would be  considered under the item on cooperation with relevant  organizations.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Delegates heard reports on  the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), Global Terrestrial  Observing System (GTOS), Committee on Earth Observation Satellites  (CEOS), and collaboration between CEOS, GCOS and the Global Earth  Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Many delegates welcomed  these reports and stressed collaboration between GCOS and GEOSS.  BANGLADESH, JAPAN and CHINA underscored data exchange and use.  UGANDA highlighted the need to address data gaps, particularly in  Africa. CHINA and PANAMA emphasized regional capacity. Stefan  Rösner (Germany) and Philip Gwage (Uganda) will co-chair a  contact group.

### COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

SBSTA coordinator Halldor  Thorgeirsson reported on the Joint Liaison Group and its  consideration of a paper on enhanced cooperation among the Rio  Conventions (Climate Change, Biodiversity and Desertification). He  also outlined relevant activities of the Commission on Sustainable  Development, including its focus on energy, atmosphere and climate  change in 2006-2007.

Delegates were then briefed on cooperation and linkages by  representatives of relevant international organizations. Peter  Bridgewater, Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, stressed the influence  of wetland management on climate change. Renate Christ, IPCC,  outlined IPCC's current work and emphasized the need for new  emission scenarios suitable for impact, vulnerability, adaptation  and mitigation assessments.

Dieter Schoene, UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO),  stressed concerns about climate change impacts on food security  and human livelihoods. John Harding, UN International Strategy for  Disaster Reduction, underscored the need to integrate climate  change adaptation into disaster risk reduction strategies. AOSIS  warned that synergies should not be a precondition for GEF  funding, because it can exclude important projects.

###     Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage

Bert Metz,  Co-Chair of IPCC Working Group III (mitigation), outlined the  IPCC's special report on carbon dioxide capture and storage,  including additional energy requirements, risks, leakage, and  legal and regulatory issues. Many delegates stressed the relevance  of carbon dioxide capture and storage as a mitigation tool. The EU  invited SBSTA to consider a workshop on the report. A contact  group was announced.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

This session was  chaired by SBSTA Vice-Chair Amjad Abdulla.

Criteria for Cases of Failure to Submit Information Relating to  Estimates of Sources and Removals by Sinks: Parties called for  consistency and clarity. Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton  Paciornik (Brazil) will co-chair a contact group.

Implications of the Implementation of Project Activities under the  CDM for the Achievement of Objectives of Other Environmental  Conventions: On implications of the establishment of new HCFC-22  facilities to obtain credits under the CDM for the destruction of  HFC-23 (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.8 and /MISC.10 and /MISC. 11), Parties  stressed the need to avoid perverse incentives. Georg Børsting  (Norway) will chair a contact group.

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION LOG UNDER THE PROTOCOL

Delegates were  briefed on this issue (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/5). Murray Ward (New  Zealand) will chair a contact group.

### OTHER MATTERS

Issues Relating to Protocol Article 2.3: SAUDI  ARABIA, supported by several Parties but opposed by the EU and  others, called for a contact group to address this issue.  Following informal consultations, Chair Abdulla reported that  Parties needed more time to discuss this matter.

###     Progress Reports

Halldor Thorgeirsson reported on the workshop on  national systems for the preparation of greenhouse gas inventories  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/6 and Corr. 1 and 2); the annual report on the  technical review of greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I  Parties (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/9); and the round table discussion on  experiences of Annex I Parties in implementing policies and  measures (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.6). The US proposed considering  policies and measures under the Protocol at SBSTA 24. Chair  Abdulla will prepare a draft conclusion taking note of this report  and proposing further consideration of the issue at SBSTA 24.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Kishan Kumarsingh, Chair of the Expert Group  on Technology Transfer (EGTT), presented EGTT's 2005 annual report  and proposed 2006 work programme (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.10). He  explained that the proposed programme would focus on, inter alia,  improving reporting of technology needs, technology information,  transfer of publicly-owned technologies, innovative financing, and  technologies for adaptation. He said the programme would require  increased financial support.

Malaysia, for the G-77/CHINA, said a COP decision should provide  guidance on the review of EGTT; stressed that new approaches to  technology transfer should be consistent with the objectives of  the UNFCCC; recommended a high-level round table on technology  cooperation and partnerships; and urged additional resources for  EGTT. JAPAN and the US emphasized the role of public-private  partnerships, and many Parties highlighted other technology- related initiatives. CHINA stressed the need to overcome tax,  intellectual property and other barriers. The EU stressed  long-term planning for EGTT and technology transfer in EGTT's  terms of reference. A contact group was announced.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Richard Hosier, GEF, explained that funding  for the LDC Fund, SCCF, and Adaptation Fund are exempted from the  RAF. He added that a report on the GEF's activities, including  using the World Bank as a trustee, was provided to COP 8  (FCCC/SBI/2002/4), and that the reason for a multi-donor trust  fund is that funding comes from CDM proceeds and from Annex I  Parties directly.

### MITIGATION

Co-Chairs Kok Seng Yap and Toshiyuki Sakamoto proposed  some ideas based on Parties' submissions and interventions as a  starting point. These ideas related to lessons learned, future  steps, and specific actions.

### ADAPTATION

Co-Chair Plume introduced a working paper containing a  summary of the informal workshop on the SBSTA programme of work on  impacts, vulnerability and adaptation held in Bonn in October 2005  (Working paper No. 2 and Add. 1). The co-chairs will prepare a  draft decision.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group met to consider  streamlining the review of reporting due from Kyoto Protocol  Parties in 2006-2007. The US emphasized the need to keep  Convention and Protocol issues separate. Delegates agreed to  discuss national communications required under the Convention  separately from reporting required under the Kyoto Protocol and to  draft two separate decisions on these issues.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

SBI plenary discussions on the relationship between the GEF and  the COP spilled into the hallways on Tuesday, as several delegates  drew linkages between these discussions and donor differences over  the size of the fourth GEF replenishment. Some already seem  unhappy with the way the GEF operates, feeling that possible  funding cuts would make it an even less appealing option. The  introduction of the RAF also drew criticism from some, who noted  that the RAF would make it more difficult for developing countries  to access funding. However, others appeared more optimistic about  the impact that the RAF might produce.
