# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL MEETINGS

### MECHANISMS

Parties continued deliberations on the  consolidated text, focusing on emissions trading. Regarding  the draft decision, the EU, JAPAN and NORWAY questioned the  need for text in the decision on principles. The G-77/CHINA, with BRAZIL, SAMOA and JAMAICA, and opposed by  the US and CANADA, said assigned amounts (AAs) were fixed.  The EU added that FCCC Article 3 (commitments) referred to  'assigned amounts' not 'initial assigned amounts'. Chair  Chow made a presentation on AAs that addressed, inter alia:  the character of an AAs; what could be transferred and  acquired; and an AAs' linkage with Protocol Articles 5, 7  and 8. SAMOA questioned whether parts of AAs (PAAs) could  be held by allocated legal entities or only by sovereign  states. She suggested that the issue of legal entities  participating in emissions trading be addressed in the  Appendix on domestic systems. She added that if legal  entities were allowed to participate, the process must be  transparent. NEW ZEALAND, with the US, said these were  Party issues, and noted his support for full transparency.  AUSTRALIA added that appropriate safeguards would be built  into Articles 5, 7 and 8 and the provisions on registries.

On the modalities of operation, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by  CANADA, questioned whether Parties could transfer PAAs that  remained unused because of factors other than P&Ms, such as  economic recession. CANADA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA and  EU, suggested withdrawing the appendix on elaborating  guidelines on national systems relating to AA units and/or  PAAs. On the share of proceeds, the US proposed that this  be addressed by the group on guidelines. On registries, the  G-77/CHINA noted that this issue could be addressed within  each of the Articles on mechanisms. COLOMBIA highlighted a  policy document submitted by various Latin American Parties  aimed at promoting more effective CDM mechanisms.

### LULUCF

The contact group considered draft SBSTA  conclusions. Delegates questioned the status of the  documents noted in the conclusions, and how they would be  developed by the Co-Chairs based on input by Parties.  TUVALU said it would be premature to have conclusions on  text that had yet to be discussed by the group.

Parties then continued consideration of Eligibility based  on the Co-Chairs' text on elements related to Article 3.3  and 3.4. Several Parties drew attention to their  submissions on the Co-Chairs' text as compiled in the new  miscellaneous document. On Accounting, SWITZERLAND, for the  ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, supported full carbon  accounting. AUSTRALIA suggested specific provisions to deal  with perverse incentives to deforest and impediments to new  forestation activity prior to the first commitment period.  Regarding text on carbon pools, TUVALU and the EU opposed  inclusion of harvested wood products, while NORWAY  supported their inclusion but noted that the issue would be  discussed at SBSTA-14. SWITZERLAND, with the EU, TUVALU and  NORWAY, and opposed by JAPAN, said natural uptake must be  separated from human-induced effects. The EU highlighted  the link between this issue and limited crediting during  the first commitment period. On limitation of debits and  credits, JAPAN said the option of no limitation of credits  should be retained.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates discussed the Co-Chairs'  draft conclusions, noting that limited progress had been  made in elaborating the elements for a draft framework to  enhance the implementation of FCCC Article 4.5 (technology  transfer).

The G-77/CHINA sought a reference to its proposal for a  draft decision due to be discussed during the second half  of SB-13. The US, EU and CANADA objected, as they had not  yet seen the document. MALAYSIA said the reference could be  made without a recommendation on how it would be addressed.  The G-77/China proposal was distributed to the group.

Resuming discussions on the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions,  the G-77/CHINA proposed deleting a paragraph inviting the  SBSTA Chair, with the assistance of the Secretariat, to  provide additional reports on the outcome of the regional  workshop, noting the limited time at COP-6 for  negotiations. She questioned the purpose of additional  information and its input to the discussions. The UK said  the workshop would inform negotiators new to the process.  MALAYSIA noted that the SBSTA Chair had the discretion to  decide if and when to organize informal meetings.

Co-Chair Cooper requested the US, G-77/China, and EU to  consult informally to seek agreement on the outstanding  paragraphs of the draft conclusions.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Co-Chair Plume introduced Part  IV of the guidelines under Article 8, Review of National  Systems, based on submissions from the EU and Australia.  She noted the conclusions forwarded from the contact group  for adoption at the SBSTA plenary, and said they included  as addenda four draft decisions for the COP and COP/MOP on  Articles 5.1, 5.2, 7 and 8, and draft guidelines under  Articles 7 and 8. She highlighted the informal  consultations to be held in Bonn in October, and invited  Parties to submit views on the guidelines under Articles  5.2, 7 and 8 to the Secretariat before 29 September. Co- Chair Plume thanked delegates for their work and closed the  contact group.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Participants met to consider sections of  the Co-Chairs' revised text on Protocol Article 3.14 and  the impact of response measures under FCCC Article 4.8 and  4.9. On Article 3.14, SAUDI ARABIA, supported by several  other developing countries, said it referred only to  actions by Annex I Parties and indicated that it was  inappropriate to suggest that non-Annex I Parties had  obligations under this Article. The US supported references  to non-Annex I Parties, as Article 3.14 did not specify  whether actions to be considered by the COP/MOP under this  Article were exclusively those of Annex I Parties.

On the impact of implementation of response measures,  JAPAN, supported by the US but opposed by CHINA, stressed  that non-Annex II Parties able to support developing  countries should be encouraged to do so. Text on the  process of information analysis was bracketed. The G-77/CHINA, KUWAIT and VENEZUELA stressed the importance of  technological development relating to fossil fuels for  diversification of economies in oil exporting developing  countries.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Economies in Transition (EITs):  Delegates met to discuss the draft framework for capacity  building in EITs and a proposed draft decision, which had  been revised following informal consultations conducted by  Slovenia. A number of paragraphs in the draft framework  were bracketed, including several references to the  Protocol. Co-Chair Ashe said Parties' comments and  amendments would be taken into consideration when reviewing  the framework and draft decision.

Developing Countries: VANUATU, on behalf of the LDCs, urged  explicit reference to the group's submissions in the  revised text as a separate section, to ensure that it  provides for the needs of the LDCs. Due to the lack of  time, consideration of the framework for capacity building  in developing countries was deferred to the next contact  group meeting.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Parties discussed sections in the Co-Chairs' text  addressing general provisions, outcomes and consequences,  and other provisions. On general provisions, Parties  differed on the need for text on principles, and agreed  that the text on functions was superfluous, given  subsequent elaboration of functions. On adoption, JAPAN  said COP-6 could recommend that the COP/MOP adopt a  decision. The EU presented two options: adoption of a  decision by COP-6 that would have immediate interim effect,  accompanied by a recommendation to COP/MOP-1 to adopt an  identical instrument; and adoption of a legal instrument  that would enter into force at the same time as the  Protocol. Parties supported different options based on  their positions on the need for binding consequences.

On consequences of non-compliance, the G-77/CHINA expressed  interest in the EU proposal on financial penalties linked  to a compliance fund. The EU emphasized the role of P&Ms in  compliance action plans and, opposed by AUSTRALIA and  CHILE, advocated an open-ended list of facilitation  consequences. The US said the facilitation branch should  not apply mandatory outcomes. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  highlighted concerns relating to, inter alia: publication  of potential non-compliance, initiation by the facilitation  branch of the enforcement procedure; and the calculation of  excess tonnes to be deducted from a Party's assigned  amount. SWITZERLAND, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP,  supported the following consequences: a compliance action  plan, restrictions on the use of mechanisms, and a  compliance fund. AUSTRALIA opposed financial penalties and  the issuing of cautions.

# SPECIAL SESSION ON LULUCF AND THE CDM

In a special session, delegates considered the issue of  including LULUCF projects within the CDM. BRAZIL, PERU,  CHILE, COLOMBIA, NEW ZEALAND, COSTA RICA, BOLIVIA,  AUSTRALIA, the US, JAPAN, URUGUAY, CANADA, NORWAY and the  ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP argued in favor of its  inclusion, citing a variety of motivations and  preconditions. The EU, TUVALU, SAMOA, CHINA and JAMAICA  urged that the CDM exclude provision for sinks.

Concerns with the inclusion of LULUCF CDM projects  included: uncertainty; leakage; non-permanence;  methodological issues in determining baselines; the  potential for promoting inappropriate forestry; geographic  and inter-generational inequity; and the potential size of  LULUCF CDM credits enabling avoidance of emissions  reductions.

Arguments in favor of CDM projects included: their  potential contribution to sustainable development in  developing countries, and the importance of carbon  sequestration. Proponents of LULUCF projects argued that  many of the technical concerns are not unique to sinks  projects, and that they may be addressed through  appropriate project design. They suggested that the key  distinguishing feature of sinks projects is permanence, and  argued that this may be addressed, citing a recent position  paper by Colombia.

Preconditions for LULUCF CDM projects included: agreeing on  sound methodologies for baselines and accounting; ensuring  coherence with international conventions relating to  biodiversity, forests, and wetlands; protection of the  rights and concerns of indigenous people; ensuring that  first-time methodologies for baseline crediting for sinks  are approved by the Executive Board; and agreeing on CDM  rules to address leakage and permanence.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some observers expressed concern Thursday regarding the  process used in formulating and presenting some conclusions  and decisions in the contact groups. They alleged that some  text that had not been discussed previously was 'slipped in  surreptitiously,' while in other cases Parties' submissions  appeared to have been 'conveniently ignored.' However,  others noted that it was an arduous task to cope with the  various group texts and proposals emerging.
