# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

During a morning meeting of the  negotiating group on Articles 5, 7 and 8, Helen Plume (New  Zealand) reported lack of progress and entrenched positions in the  drafting group dealing with LULUCF, and urged greater flexibility.  Regarding Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects), Chair Dovland  noted that it is referred to, in brackets, in the draft guidelines  and corresponding draft decisions, and that the options involve  whether or not reporting problems should lead to non-compliance  and loss of mechanisms eligibility. He suggested instituting an  additional review within the annual review for Article 3.14, but  no loss of eligibility, as a compromise solution. AOSIS, NEW  ZEALAND, CG-11, AUSTRALIA and the EU supported continued work  based on the proposal. The G-77/CHINA supported an annual desk  review and a periodic review in conjunction with national  communications. JAPAN, with a number of other Annex I Parties,  indicated that he did not consider reporting under Article 3.14 to  be mandatory, and could not accept a link to mechanisms  eligibility. Chair Dovland referred the issue to a drafting group  chaired by Newton Paciornik (Brazil).

Delegates then discussed matters relating to Protocol Article 4  (regional integration organization). The EU stated that specific  reporting guidelines for regional integration organizations (RIOs)  were not necessary. AOSIS, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, and CANADA stressed  the need to ensure transparency and consistency between national  inventories and that of the RIOs. The issue was set aside for  further consideration.

On the start of the annual review under Article 8, the EU stressed  that mechanisms' eligibility is determined during the pre- commitment period review, and highlighted the need for subsequent  inventory reviews to be made under the same conditions. She  supported starting the annual review in the year following the  review prior to the commitment period for that Party. AUSTRALIA  suggested language for a new paragraph allowing a voluntary review  for each year subsequent to the pre-commitment period and prior to  the first inventory due under the Protocol. Co-Chair Dovland  invited interested Parties to consult on this issue.

On the section on reporting of supplementary information on  mechanisms under Article 7.2 (national communications), the G-77/CHINA suggested an alternative paragraph specifying that the  Party report a list and brief descriptions of projects under  Articles 6 and 12, for which credits are held in registries during  the reporting period. AUSTRALIA, with JAPAN, the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION and POLAND, supported not having a paragraph on  mechanisms in this section. He explained that the information to  be reported should be discussed in the context of Article 7.4  (modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts). Co-Chair  Dovland suggested retaining the G-77/CHINA proposal in brackets  and returning to it once work on the section on Article 7.4 was  completed.

On the section on the reporting of supplementary information on  Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms) under Article 7.2,  JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, and the EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA and  NIGERIA, said the relevant information will be provided in  accordance with the guidelines as they relate to Article 3.14, and  the paragraphs on Article 2.3 should be deleted from this section.  The issue was not resolved.

On the start of the annual compilation and accounting of emissions  inventories and assigned amounts in the draft COP/MOP-1 decision,  delegates preferred the option that requests the Secretariat to  start such compilation and accounting in the year that a Party  commences reporting under Article 7.1 (inventories); however,  emissions inventories for the purpose of compliance with Protocol  Article 3 (emissions targets) shall not be compiled until the  inventory for the first year of the commitment period is  available. This remains undecided pending outcomes from the  drafting group on Article 7.4. Mandatory aspects of implementation  related to review under Article 8 and review of national systems  were referred to a drafting group.

Drafting groups met in the afternoon and evening to consider the  various issues referred to them by the negotiating group, with  relatively little progress reported.

### MECHANISMS

Parties met in the mechanisms negotiating group in the  afternoon and evening to consider draft text from the informal  groups on Protocol Articles 6 (JI) and 7.4 (assigned amounts).  Participants heard reports from informal consultations held on  mechanisms-related matters. Murray Ward (New Zealand) reported  from a group convened on Article 6. He said that agreement has  been reached on standards and procedures for accreditation of  independent entities of the CDM. He noted that the criteria on  baseline and monitoring, accreditation and verification procedures  had been discussed yet differences remained. Outstanding issues  included the role of the supervisory committee.

Reporting on informal consultations held on the CDM, Chair Miguez  said agreement had been reached on standards for the accreditation  of operational entities, with progress also made on validation,  and registration and monitoring. He noted that outstanding issues  included provisions related to the authority of the Executive  Board, and that informal discussions will continue on Friday.

The negotiating group then continued discussions on Article 6. On  supervisory committee responsibilities, Parties expressed  divergent positions over the elaboration of reporting guidelines,  criteria setting for baselines, and monitoring. The EU, supported  by JAPAN, suggested it should be the role of SBSTA, while SAMOA,  the G-77/CHINA, said it should be a function of the supervisory  committee. The issue was referred to ministers for a political  decision.

Delegates also deferred to ministers the issue of the composition  of the supervisory committee as well as the linked issues relating  to the election of its chair and vice-chair, and the coverage of  costs of participation of members from developing country Parties.

On decision-making, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested a simple  majority system. JAPAN, CANADA, POLAND and HUNGARY said the issue  was linked to the outcome on the composition of the committee, and  the issue was referred to ministers. Delegates then agreed to a  proposal from CHINA reproducing a paragraph from the CDM text on  the working language of the committee, the dissemination of its  decisions, as well as the languages in which such decisions would  be made available. The group also agreed to a proposal from SAMOA  reproducing a paragraph from the CDM text on the open attendance  of the committee meetings, with the addition that attendance also  be open to 'accredited stakeholders.' On participation requirements relating to the procedures and  mechanisms on compliance under the Protocol, the co-chairs  proposed a compromise reproducing language from the Bonn  Agreements whereby only Parties that have accepted the agreement  on compliance supplementing the Protocol shall be entitled to  transfer or acquire credits generated by the use of mechanisms.  JAPAN, CANADA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION opposed this proposal,  however the co-chairs said it would go forward to the COP in this  form. CANADA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION requested a footnote  indicating their position.

On Article 7.4, the G-77/CHINA said it was preparing a position  paper.

# INFORMAL GROUPS AND CONSULTATIONS

### CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

An informal group chaired by Mohammed Chraibi  (Morocco) convened to consider eligibility and election of the CDM  Executive Board. Agreement was reached on a transition period  prior to Protocol ratification where the Board would be open to  all UNFCCC Parties, under the condition that once the Protocol  entered into force new members would be elected. The size of the  Board was also discussed, and a proposal was made by the G-77/CHINA considering additional Annex I and non-Annex I board  members. Discussions will continue Friday afternoon.

### COMPLIANCE

The compliance drafting group met in an afternoon  session to consider the outstanding issues requiring redrafting,  as identified in the negotiating group, with the exception of  consequences. Delegates reportedly made little progress, with only  a few drafting points cleared. The drafting group also met in a  late afternoon session to discuss an EU alternative proposal for  the draft COP-7 decision.

### CGE

The informal contact group on the CGE met in morning and  afternoon sessions. In the morning, Parties discussed whether to  consider the revision of the terms of reference for the CGE or the  guidelines for the preparation of national communications from  non-Annex I Parties first. At the end of the first meeting, it was  agreed to begin with the terms of reference. Parties discussed  language in this document referring to LDCs. Several LDCs noted  that the CGE did not have a mandate to address the LDC NAPA  process. The EU stressed linkages between the processes of  preparing national communications and NAPAs. Text referring to  LDCs was bracketed. On the composition of the CGE, the G-77/CHINA  requested removal of the expert from non-Annex I Parties in Europe  proposed in the new terms of reference. The EU, SWITZERLAND and  AUSTRALIA supported maintaining the current composition, and  SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA suggested consideration of the terms of  reference was therefore not necessary and could be withdrawn.  Parties agreed to wait for the outcomes from the discussions in  the informal group on LDCs before proceeding.

### LDCS

In a meeting of the informal group on LDCs held late  afternoon, Chair Sibusiso Gamede (South Africa) reported on  consultations held in the morning on guidelines on NAPAs. While  noting progress, he said some Parties had proposed enlisting more  expert assistance on the guidelines, and indicated that  discussions would resume Friday.

Delegates then considered a draft proposal by the LDC Group for a  COP decision on the establishment of an LDC expert group,  including an annex containing terms of reference for the group. A  number of Annex I Parties raised concerns about the proposal, with  the US and SWITZERLAND noting similar discussions taking place in  the CGE group, and the EU suggesting that the groups might be  combined at some point. Several LDCs highlighted the efficiency  and value of an expert group in NAPA preparation and  implementation. Delegates then discussed specific text in the  proposed terms of reference on this expert group's mandate, with  the EU, supported by other Annex I Parties, bracketing text  relating to implementation of NAPAs.

### METHODS AND TOOLS TO EVALUATE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION

Informal  consultations on methods to evaluate impacts and adaptation  continued work on a draft decision. A revised draft is being  prepared following concerns expressed by the G-77/CHINA that the  first document did not reflect outcomes of a workshop held on this  issue in Montreal in June.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Negotiations on Thursday 'went into top gear, then stalled,'  according to one delegate. While numerous negotiations and  consultations were scheduled throughout the day and into the  night, some participants were openly questioning how much genuine  progress was resulting on the key issues, with little movement  reported. The decision to refer some JI matters to ministers and  other senior officials at next week's high-level segment was also  seen as a clear acknowledgement that not all outstanding issues  can be dealt with in a 'technical' setting, raising fears that  some aspects of the Bonn Agreements are being relitigated.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### NEGOTIATING GROUPS

The group on Articles 5, 7 and 8 is expected  to meet at 3:00 pm in Fez 1 to consider new texts from the  drafting groups. The mechanisms group will focus on the CDM and  its Executive Board.

The timing and location of negotiating groups and informal  consultations are subject to change. For more information, check  the monitors.
