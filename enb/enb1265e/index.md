# AGBM PLENARY

Chair Raul Estrada-Oyuela convened the AGBM Plenary to  address non-group outcomes. He said that although positions  were still far apart, some progress had been made in what  was the first round of negotiations on a consolidated text.  He wondered whether the nature of diverging views, enclosed  in brackets in the papers produced by the non-groups, could  be explained to 'an intelligent public not imbued with the  subtleties of negotiations.'

# POLICIES AND MEASURES

The Chair of the non-group on policies and measures (P&Ms),  Bakary Kante (Senegal), introduced a paper and said the  group reached consensus on one of five sub-paragraphs in  the AGBM Chair's draft text. On the chapeau, he noted that  a reference to a specific article had been bracketed  pending outcomes on voluntary commitments. He said the  group had agreed on the first part of a sub-paragraph on  the implementation and adoption of P&Ms by Annex I Parties  to achieve QELROs but had disagreed on a part listing P&Ms  under an annex. Two bracketed alternatives appeared for a  sub-paragraph addressing the need to 'try to avoid' or  'take into account' adverse effects when implementing P&Ms.  No agreement was reached on language indicating that Annex  I Parties shall coordinate the implementation of P&Ms  listed under an annex. Two proposed annexes listing P&Ms  were attached to the document.

The US, supported by CANADA, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA proposed  bracketing text that 'the COP/MOP shall assess the  application of P&Ms.' The EU proposed merging two bracketed  alternatives referring to P&Ms listed in an annex. CANADA,  the US and JAPAN said that proposals on annexes had not  been negotiated. JAPAN favored an alternative stating that  P&Ms shall be adopted in accordance with national  circumstances. HUNGARY noted its acceptance of coordinated  P&Ms. The EU, the G-77/CHINA and AUSTRALIA agreed that P&Ms  should not be listed in an annex but should be incorporated  into the Protocol. The US expressed its preference for  listing P&Ms under an annex. CAMBODIA called on all Parties  to show some flexibility.

The Chair asked for comments on the COP/MOP assessment  sentence. The US, CANADA and AUSTRALIA preferred removal or  brackets. The EU disagreed. SLOVENIA said the sentence  could be moved.

The Chair ruled that there was consensus to retain the text  except for three countries. CHINA asked if the text would  be communicated to Kyoto with brackets. The Chair said  nothing is agreed until everything is.

The US raised a point of order that there was no consensus.  The Chair said delegates could challenge his decision under  the rules of procedure. The US, CANADA and VENEZUELA said  there could not be consensus if delegations objected.  VENEZUELA challenged the ruling. The Chair noted that a 2/3  vote was required to overcome the ruling and called for a  vote.

EGYPT said delegations were referring to unanimity. The  Chair's ruling on consensus reflected his sense of the  negotiations. The Chair said it was necessary to  distinguish between unanimity and consensus. IRAN and  KUWAIT requested a legal opinion. The US proposed that the  Chair produce a text of his conclusions. He said he feared  voting on every paragraph and bracket. VENEZUELA accepted  that the Chair had taken the sense of the meeting. The  Chair said his ruling meant this. MAURITANIA said every  decision should be left to Kyoto. HUNGARY asked delegates  to 'cool down.' SAUDI ARABIA said adoptions at this stage were meaningless.  All amendments will be forwarded to Kyoto. He asked the  Chair to relax. The Chair said with the challenge  withdrawn, there would be no vote. He said it was clear  that a group of countries was trying to stop the Convention  and the protocol, but he would not be 'held hostage' to  countries methodically trying to stop progress.

The non-group Chair noted two alternatives for a paragraph  on adverse effects of P&Ms. The US proposed a reformulation  calling for assessment of the overall effect on climate  change and Parties' social, environmental and economic  situations. The G-77/CHINA requested a footnote linking the  issue to a clean development fund.

On cooperation between Parties to enhance effectiveness,   the EU agreed to take up the question of voluntary  application of P&Ms in discussions on voluntary  commitments, and  discuss voluntary accession by non-Annex  I countries on a basis easier than quantitative targets.  After a Japanese amendment, the Chair wondered if Parties  would eventually decide to reduce emissions 'as  appropriate.'

# EXISTING COMMITMENTS IN ARTICLE 4.1

The Chair of the non-group on FCCC Article 4.1, Evans King  (Trinidad), introduced a report on his group's work  (FCCC/AGBM/1997/CRP.I) on Articles 12 and 13. He said there  has been substantial progress and that the text can  establish the boundaries for future negotiation. There is  no agreement on: mitigation and adaptation programmes,  technology transfer, and taking account of climate change  in policy. He said that specific measures to advance  existing non-Annex I Party commitments and their relation  to financial provision and technology transfer is a  substantive issue cutting across the work. Once a common  understanding emerges, other brackets will also be  resolved.

A representative of the environmental NGOs said the FCCC  article applies to all Parties. The Chair of the non-group  has failed to adequately advance implementation as  obligations must be tightly defined and measurable,  producing text riddled with qualifications and weak  language. Advancement of Article 4.1 commitments are linked  to technology transfer and supportive policies including  innovative approaches to lever private sector involvement.  Article 4.1 should not be used to negotiate commitments for  developing countries through the back door.

The AGBM Chair noted that the Chapeau could be agreed with  unanimity.

Delegates debated the order of 'national' and 'regional'  programmes in a subparagraph on inventories. The G-77/CHINA  proposed deleting 'models' and adding a reference to  adopted guidelines. The US and NEW ZEALAND objected. POLAND  requested deletion of 'cost-effective.' The EU objected.

The G-77/CHINA objected to a list of 'economically  justified' mitigation programmes, suggesting it represents  new developing country commitments and mirrors the P&Ms  annex still under negotiation. She had similar objections  to the following subparagraph's lists of adaptation  programmes. She preferred deleting the lists and retaining  the G-77/CHINA's alternative, separately describing Annex-I  and developing country programmes. She amended the  alternative to include programme information in national  communications. JAPAN, the EU and US preferred to remove  brackets from the mitigation list, noting that it is  indicative. The US said the list is not new commitments but  puts 'flesh on the bones' of Article 4.1(b).

NEPAL added mountain development to the adaptation list.  The US bracketed 'protection measures for infrastructure'  because of funding implications.

On transfer of technology, the G-77/CHINA proposed the  deletion of a paragraph on promoting effective modalities  for transfers because it would introduce new and  unacceptable commitments under the protocol. She supported  an alternative paragraph, based on the FCCC and Agenda 21.  The US, supported by JAPAN and CANADA, suggested combining  elements in the two paragraphs but objected to references  to 'financial and fiscal incentives' and 'patent-protected  environmentally sound technologies.' On procedures to ensure that climate change considerations  are taken into account in governmental and  intergovernmental decisions, the US recalled NGO support  for  environmental impact assessment and promoting climate  friendly technology. The EU, supported by the US, proposed  a reformulation, on the identification and implementation  of procedures, specifying multilateral development banks.  The G-77/CHINA said the commitment should not be subsumed  in a protocol that has a limited thrust. This would amount  to undertaking a new commitment. She said the reference to  multilateral development banks would introduce a  conditionality to financing. The text remains in brackets.

On sharing information on national development and use of  indicators,  the G-77/CHINA objected to the paragraph  because it would amount to a new commitment under the  protocol. The paragraph remains in brackets.

Chair Estrada remarked that Parties will have to limit the  scope of the protocol below what was agreed in Berlin at  some point.

On education and training, the US introduced an amendment  on strengthening of national level education and training  programmes, removed brackets from a reference to training  experts 'in particular for developing countries,' and  replaced a reference to methodologies with 'modalities.' On communications on implementation of commitments under  the protocol, the G-77/CHINA said that communications  should be forwarded to the FCCC Parties. The US explained  that for Parties to the FCCC communications will go to the  COP, for Parties to the protocol they will go also to the  protocol body. He said a role in developing guidelines  should not be ruled out for the MOP. The G-77/CHINA said  that she could not agree to report to any body but the COP.

QELROs QELROs-1 non-group Chair Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil)  introduced a document resulting from the work of the two  non-groups. He noted that key issues were bracketed and  hoped they would be resolved in Kyoto. He indicated that  there had been agreement on an article addressing  supplementary information for annual inventories of GHGs  and national communications by Annex I Parties. He pointed  out that definition of values and dates was pending, as  well as the consideration of removals by sinks under  QELROs. He hoped the AGBM would minimize the issues it  addresses regarding sinks, considering time constraints at  Kyoto. He also called attention to a definition of 'net' to  be included in the Protocol.

Chair Bo Kjellén (Sweden) reported that further  consultations were taking place on QELROs for Annex I  Parties with economies in transition, that articles on  emissions trading and joint implementation were completely  bracketed, that an article on national communications was  agreed to, except for specific references to an article on  voluntary commitments and to the Meeting of the Parties,  and that no agreement had been reached on voluntary  commitments.

The AGBM Chair suggested that three alternatives on QELROs  for Annex I Parties be referred as such to COP-3. NEW  ZEALAND, supported by CANADA and JAPAN, indicated that the  issue of removals by sinks had not been formally discussed  by the non-groups on QELROs. JAPAN, supported by the UK and  NAURU stated that references to 'net' and 'removals by  sinks' that appeared in the text should be bracketed.  AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, CANADA and RUSSIA said that  references to 'net' should not be bracketed. The US said  language on 'removals by sinks' should not be bracketed.

The AGBM Chair ruled that there would be 'precautionary  brackets' around the word 'net' until the issue of sinks  was settled.

# EVENING SESSION

In an evening session, delegates began discussions on the  QELROs non-group reports. As of 10:00 pm, they had  considered Article 3 (commitments), 3bis (joint fulfillment  of obligations) and Article 4. Delegates debated retaining  actual, rather than 'precautionary,' brackets on references  to 'net' emissions, noting difficulties with the definition  of anthropogenic sinks. Delegates also discussed, inter  alia: a G-77/China proposal reflecting a 'flat rate'  approach; flexibility for Parties with economies in  transition undergoing the process of transition to a market  economy; joint fulfillment of obligations; and bracketed  references to budgets.Later in the session, the US,  supported by CANADA and AUSTRALIA, suggested adding  bracketed text on evolution of developing countries'  commitments to the article on existing commitments. The  Chair said he would not add the text.

A revised text is expected on Friday.
