# COP CONTACT GROUPS

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group, co-chaired by  José Ovalle (Chile) and Michael Zammit-Cutajar (Malta), discussed  a draft COP decision. ARGENTINA noted omissions in the draft  decision regarding the scope of the issues, the extent of delay in  submission of documents, problems in the implementation of P&Ms,  and increasing emissions levels. He outlined problems of  incompatible methods for making projections and of grouping  together net and gross emissions. The US said references to  commitments under the Protocol may be premature, questioned the  interpretation of Article 4.2 (a) and (b) (fulfillment of  commitments by developed country Parties) and objected to the  focus on international aviation, noting that discussion of this  issue should await the outcomes of SBSTA's discussions.

Parties also addressed holding a workshop for facilitating timely  submission of fourth national communications. Opposed by the EU,  the G-77/CHINA suggested removing reference to Article 4.2  throughout the draft decision, noting that this was judgmental.  The US suggested this could address many of the concerns expressed  in the group. Parties will continue deliberations in informal  consultations on Monday, 8 December.

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group discussed  the Co-Chairs' revised draft conclusions on the consideration of  the fifth compilation and synthesis of initial national  communications, and on work of the CGE. Parties discussed whether  to qualify how many non-Annex I Parties have submitted projects  for funding, with the G-77/CHINA suggesting removing reference to  'many' non-Annex I Parties. The EU said that since not all non- Annex I Parties have submitted national communications, absence of  qualification would be misleading. Addressing the urgency of  submission of initial national communications, delegates discussed  whether submissions should be 'invited,' 'urged' or 'encouraged.' Parties deliberated whether the preparation of national  communications has provided a 'valuable opportunity' for capacity  building, with the G-77/CHINA urging deletion of this reference.  Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, JAPAN preferred removing reference to  'further' financial and technical support for enhancing national  capacities. Regarding a compilation and synthesis of information  from national communications from small island developing States  (SIDS) with a focus on adaptation and mitigation, NIUE and ANTIGUA  AND BARBUDA, supported by the US, AUSTRALIA, and EU, urged  retaining this as a separate synthesis document.

Turning to work of the CGE, Parties addressed how workshops should  be organized. The EU, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that  workshops could address all thematic areas in a combined approach,  rather than addressing one theme only. THAILAND stressed that such  an approach would not necessarily enhance 'effectiveness and  efficiency' of the workshops.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Delegates discussed the Chair's draft  conclusions, which centered on the need and timing of a workshop,  and on the dates and substance of submissions requested from  Parties. Parties decided that these submissions will be  incorporated into a text on the effectiveness of capacity building  in developing countries to be prepared by the Secretariat in time  for SBSTA-20. Parties agreed on the need for coherence between  decisions on capacity building and those taken on technology  transfer related to capacity building.

On guidance to the GEF, CROATIA proposed a request to the GEF that  its approach to enhancing capacity building should respond to the  framework for capacity building in EITs. SWITZERLAND, AUSTRALIA  and the US proposed forwarding text on further guidance to the GEF  for consideration under the relevant agenda item. The G-77/CHINA  and EU objected, noting the importance of capacity-building  experts agreeing on the text first. Due to lack of time, Parties  agreed to forward the bracketed text for consideration under the  agenda item on further guidance to the GEF.

### SCCF

The G-77/CHINA introduced the Group's views on the Co- Chairs' draft decision, noting, inter alia, that the SCCF should  be financed from new and additional funds, and that the funding  level of the SCCF should match that of the GEF's climate change  focal area. Delegates then undertook a paragraph-by-paragraph  reading of the text. The EU, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, said the  objective of the SCCF is to assist developing countries to  integrate climate change factors into national sustainable  development and poverty reduction strategies, and their  implementation. Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, he urged that the  SCCF's function is to support mainstreaming of climate change  factors in development activities at national and local levels.  The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU and NORWAY, stressed the need  for predictable and adequate funding levels. On the inclusion of  activities in decision 7/CP.7 (funding under the UNFCCC),  particularly on economic diversification, the EU, with NORWAY,  opposed by the G-77/CHINA, called for the deletion of the  reference. Sharing the same concern, CANADA proposed discussing a  process to further elaborate these items following the  operationalization of the SCCF.

### PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

Delegates in this  contact group, co-chaired by Rob Mason (UK) and Al Waleed Al-Malik  (United Arab Emirates), reviewed Parties' perspectives on progress  on the implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7.  Underlining the linkages of adaptation with other issues, the EU  said decision 5/CP.7 enables important activities to be developed  further. The G-77/CHINA said there is a need for substantive  discussions on implementation of the decision, with a view to  building on existing work. Noting that, in terms of the UNFCCC,  adaptation is the priority, MICRONESIA, for AOSIS, stressed the  vulnerability of SIDS and underlined, inter alia, the need for  building capacity, addressing insurance challenges, and improving  access to funding. SAUDI ARABIA underscored the need to take  immediate action, support developing countries in the technical  development of non-energy uses of fossil fuels, and exchange  information on win-win P&Ms that reduce greenhouse gas emissions,  while minimizing adverse impacts on developing countries.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### R&SO

Parties considered a revised draft COP decision and draft  conclusions. CHILE, the EU and US objected to referring to the  importance of adhering to adopted principles of free and  unrestricted exchange of information, noting that such principles  do not exist. The G-77/CHINA said the Group would consult  internally on this matter. Stressing the importance of sustained  funding for regional action plans, the G-77/CHINA suggested that  guidance on this issue should be given to the GEF. Referring to  the SBSTA-17 conclusions containing a provision on this matter,  Co-Chair Sue Barrell asked the G-77/CHINA whether it was necessary  to include a request to the SBI to examine additional GEF guidance  on this issue in the conclusions. The G-77/CHINA said it would  hold internal consultations on the matter.

### IPCC TAR

Chair Halldór Thorgeirsson reported on informal  consultations, noting that Parties highlighted the need to: build  upon existing agreement; advance work without establishing  constraints; encourage broad participation, including from  experts, while keeping the process under Party control; and ensure  participation by all Parties. He proposed holding a 'sessional'  workshop that would ensure participation by all Parties. SAUDI  ARABIA said work should focus on determining the terms of  reference of the workshop. The G-77/CHINA, NEW ZEALAND and  THAILAND stressed the need to determine the workshop's scope.  CHINA, INDIA, SUDAN and SAUDI ARABIA proposed structured  submissions on priority themes for consideration at the workshop.  The EU and NORWAY said there is no need for further submissions.  The G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and OMAN objected to a COP decision,  while the EU, NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CANADA  expressed support for it.

Chair Thorgeirsson introduced a revised draft COP decision and  draft conclusions, and invited Parties to meet in informal  consultations on Saturday, 6 December.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Delegates reviewed the Co-Chairs' draft  conclusions. SAUDI ARABIA requested that a paragraph referring to  the elements of future methodological work in an annex to the  conclusions should be bracketed, until those elements are agreed.  The US said cost implications must be noted. AUSTRALIA, opposed by  UGANDA, said the data reported by Parties rather than the database  should be referred to as the 'authoritative source.' AUSTRALIA  introduced new text clarifying the role of a data-interface  scoping phase, emphasizing that Parties should exchange views and  consider a range of options. NEW ZEALAND, supported by CANADA, and  opposed by the EU and JAPAN, suggested text noting that the  conclusions complete the work under the agenda sub-item. CANADA  recommended that text on capacity building and collaborative  efforts be linked to the elements of methodological work. SAUDI  ARABIA suggested deleting text on periodic overviews and stressed  the need to focus on implementation. Discussions will continue in  informal consultations on Saturday, 6 December.

### GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE ON LULUCF

Delegates discussed draft  conclusions, which, inter alia, recommend use of the IPCC Good  Practice Guidance (GPG) under the UNFCCC and to consider them  further at SBSTA-20 before recommending their use under the  Protocol. TUVALU, for AOSIS, raised concern over adopting the GPG  without sufficient time for its examination, and over the  practicality of considering the GPG for the UNFCCC and Protocol  separately. The IPCC explained how this is addressed in the GPG.  The EU, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA urged adopting the  guidelines for both the UNFCCC and the Protocol in order to  prepare national inventories in time for entry into force of the  Protocol. NEW ZEALAND, supported by AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION, emphasized the importance of adopting the GPG to  advance the implementation of the UNFCCC, and the EU noted that  delaying adoption of the GPG will prevent preparation of inventory  submissions due in 2006. Opposed by TUVALU, the EU recommended  recording Tuvalu's concerns in the meeting's minutes instead of  amending the draft conclusions.

On degradation of forests and devegetation of other vegetation  types, Parties debated whether the SBSTA should invite Parties to  submit their views on possible definitions and methodologies to  the Secretariat. TUVALU proposed referring to decision 11/CP.7  (LULUCF).

### SINKS IN THE CDM

Co-Chair Karsten Sach outlined pending issues  regarding sinks in the CDM, and announced that a Co-Chairs' text  will be presented at the contact group meeting on Saturday, 6  December. A representative of INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' ORGANIZATIONS  urged delegates to adopt international standards for socioeconomic  and environmental criteria for LULUCF project activities under the  CDM. The meeting was then adjourned.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Fear of a looming second commitment period and developing country  commitments finally became evident Friday, as discussions on the  synthesis of Annex I national communications indicated the scope  of the climate challenge in the upcoming decade. While the outcome  of this debate could potentially provide the foundation for  success in Milan, it seems to be heading down a rocky road - as  developing countries fear that any recognition of the forthcoming  emissions reduction challenge in a COP decision implies a global  response to climate change involving all Parties. On a positive  note, the fact that the former UNFCCC Executive Secretary is co- chairing these negotiations has led some 'climate old-timers' to  suggest that his 'eloquent diplomacy' and historical knowledge of  the 'highs' and 'lows' of the last ten years of climate  negotiations could steer the debate towards groundbreaking  conclusions.

On another note, the RINGOs - Research and Independent NGOs - were  officially established as a group under the UNFCCC.
