# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

The high-level panel discussions heard statements from panelists  on three topics, each followed by comments from Parties.

### PANEL 2 - 'IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE, ADAPTATION MEASURES AND  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

' This panel was moderated by Ambassador  Enele Sopoaga, Tuvalu. He said action on adaptation is being  stalled by its link with action on response measures.

###     Panel statements

Ian Campbell, Minister of Environment,  Australia, stressed that engaging in adaptation must not be seen  as an excuse for avoiding mitigation. He noted the need to address  local and regional knowledge-gaps, and for actions to be tailored  to local socioeconomic conditions.

Jafrul Islam Chowdhury, Minister of Environment and Forests,  Bangladesh, underscored the high vulnerability of Bangladesh to  climate change impacts and welcomed COP-10's commitment to move  adaptation issues forward. He offered to host a workshop on risk  and micro-insurance.

Miklós Persányi, Minister of Environment and Water, Hungary, noted  that the more mitigation is carried out, the less adaptation is  needed.

Alberto Cárdenas Jiménez, Secretary of Environment and Natural  Resources, Mexico, said the absence of adaptation programmes  limits the economic ability of developing countries to achieve  sustainable development. He said adaptation has been addressed in  a fragmented manner in the climate process and supported the  Argentine proposal for an adaptation work programme.

Modou Fada Diagne, Minister of Environment, Senegal, said that  West Africa is already suffering the consequences of climate  change. He noted that regional models remain imprecise and that  developing country experts should be involved in developing  climate models. He called for technical assistance from developed  countries.

Margaret Beckett, Secretary of State Department for Environment,  Food and Rural Affairs, UK, pointed to the recent findings on  climate change impacts in the Arctic and to the European heat-wave  in 2003 as indicators that climate change is affecting both the  developed and developing world.

###     Discussion

UKRAINE and OMAN noted their recent ratifications of  the Protocol. EGYPT stressed the need for greater efforts on  adaptation and technology transfer. NORWAY underlined the need for  a strong political response coming out of COP-10. ROMANIA  supported the integration of adaptation and mitigation measures.  JAPAN noted a paradigm shift in the awareness of its citizens,  following recent extreme weather events in Japan. He said that  Japan is engaging in 'proactive' action for adaptation. TANZANIA  said adaptation to climate change is an equity issue, noting the  disproportionate impacts of climate change on LDCs.

SOUTH AFRICA called for sustained financial support for developing  countries to implement adaptation plans and, with INDONESIA, said  these should be integrated into development plans. ICELAND, NORWAY  and FINLAND pointed to the Arctic assessment of climate change,  which shows that the Arctic climate is warming rapidly. FINLAND  highlighted the need to make all actors aware of climate risks to  enable them to prepare for the consequences of climate change.  MICRONESIA said the eligibility criteria for adaptation funds  should be streamlined. BRAZIL stressed the importance of  developing scientific and technical cooperation and creating a  network of research centers on adaptation in developing countries.  INDONESIA said adaptation funding should include research.

CANADA said adaptation to climate change is a global problem that  requires resolute international initiatives. The US said the US  Country Studies Program was one of the first to carry out  vulnerability assessments, and FRANCE noted efforts to undertake  vulnerability assessments of French coastal zones. SRI LANKA  recalled that poverty eradication is the main challenge, and  called for adaptation funding to be equitably distributed.  BARBADOS, for AOSIS, called for further implementation of the  Barbados Programme of Action.

OMAN and QATAR underscored the importance of implementing UNFCCC  Article 4.8 (adverse effects) with respect to response measures.  KIRIBATI and FIJI stressed that adaptation measures should respond  only to the adverse impacts of climate change, and not to the  adverse impacts of mitigation measures. FIJI urged the  international community to be sympathetic to the needs of SIDS.  GABON highlighted the importance of Central African forests in  global carbon sequestration and emphasized the need to streamline  the funding process. KAZAKHSTAN said his country is ready to  undertake voluntary commitments for greenhouse gas emissions  reductions. MALTA said the costs of climate change impacts should  be widely recognized and supported an open-ended dialogue.

### PANEL 3 - 'TECHNOLOGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE

' This panel was  moderated by Eduardo Campos, Minister of Science and Technology,  Brazil, who noted that climate action should promote sustainable  development and poverty eradication.

###     Panel statements

Moritz Leuenberger, Federal Councillor and Head  of the Federal Department for Environment, Switzerland, said  sustainable development is the backbone of sustainable climate  policy. He said his country is tackling the 'acute' transport  emissions problem by working with partners across Europe. He also  noted cooperative efforts to expand renewable energy in developing  countries.

Knut Arild Hareide, Minister of Environment, Norway, underscored  the importance of technology but said it cannot replace agreements  such as the Protocol and urged countries to address the post-2012  period.

Stavros Dimas, Commissioner for the Environment, European  Commission, said incentive systems should be implemented to  promote research, development, use and worldwide diffusion of  climate-friendly technologies.

S. Sothinathan, Vice Minister for Natural Resources and  Environment, Malaysia, welcomed the Protocol mechanisms, but noted  that without government incentives, such mechanisms are unlikely  to provide technology transfer. He requested Annex I Parties to  provide an inventory of available climate-related technologies.

Francisco Taula Constancio Mabjaia, Vice-Minister of Environment,  Mozambique, expressed disappointment at the absence of progress on  CDM projects in Africa. He said developing countries require both  mitigation and adaptation technologies and proposed an adaptation  and technology bazaar in Africa.

Rejoice Mabudafhasi, Vice-Minister for Environmental Affairs and  Tourism, South Africa, said tackling climate change requires  political will, and called for financial and capacity development  in regional centers of expertise.

The US supported strong  market-based institutions to manage long-term climate change.  SAUDI ARABIA and the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC said technological change  requires political will to remove the barriers that prevent use  and diffusion of new technologies. CANADA said a 'technology  revolution' is needed.

EL SALVADOR described clean-energy technologies developed in his  country or acquired through international cooperation. SWEDEN said  developing countries with rapid economic growth are undergoing  technological changes that will determine the possibilities for  future emissions reductions. The MALDIVES urged all Parties to  agree on, and operationalize, the LDC Fund. TANZANIA and MALI  prioritized the transfer of adaptation-related technology.  GUATEMALA identified barriers to technology transfer, including  financial, implementation, and dissemination issues. SURINAME said  partnerships to promote clean technologies are needed.

### PANEL 4 - 'MITIGATION OF CLIMATE CHANGE

POLICIES AND THEIR  IMPACTS:' Cristina Narbona, Minister of Environment, Spain,  moderated the panel, stressing the equitable dimension of efforts  to transform the current global energy model into a sustainable  one.

###     Panel statements

Sandra del Rosario Suárez Pérez, Minister of  Environment, Colombia, said her country offers numerous  high-quality CDM projects, is vulnerable both to climate change  and to the impacts of response measures, and called for ambitious  emissions reductions commitments that are consistent with the best  science and the UNFCCC's ultimate objective.

Serge Lepeltier, Minister of Environment and Development, France,  emphasized that tackling climate change provides economic  opportunities and stated that inaction can be more costly than  prevention.

Stephen Kolonzo Musyoka, Minister of Environment and Natural  Resources, Kenya, underscored that, for Africa, 'adaptation is the  only way,' and that technology transfer is crucial.

Tomasz Podgajniak, Under-Secretary of State, Poland, highlighted  his country's transition to cleaner technologies while improving  the economy, and called for mitigation policies that are not a  barrier to development, but rather a booster for growth.

Ali al-Naimi, Minister of Oil and Natural Resources, Saudi Arabia,  reminded delegates of the cost that response measures would impose  on oil-producing countries.

###     Discussion

PERU, for the Andean Community, highlighted the  synergies between action on climate change, biodiversity, disaster  reduction and desertification. Noting the success of Japanese  hybrid vehicles, JAPAN said this demonstrates that mitigation can  be a driving force for new business. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA  stressed the need to integrate mitigation into development  planning. QATAR, for the G-77/China, underscored that  responsibility for reducing emissions falls on developed  countries. BULGARIA drew attention to her country's 'Green  Investment Scheme,' an instrument that ensures that Bulgaria's  revenue from selling surplus emissions credits is earmarked for  green investments.

NEPAL stressed the need for accessible, low-cost technology. The  CZECH REPUBLIC outlined his country's national climate change  strategy, which aims to reduce emissions by 25% by 2020.

# COP CONTACT GROUP

### EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON UNFCCC ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO OTHER  INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

On reporting the activities of the  ten-year review of the Barbados Programme of Action (BPOA+10), the  World Conference on Disaster Reduction (WCDR) and CSD processes to  the UNFCCC, the US suggested only reporting to SBSTA-23 and only  on CSD activities. SAUDI ARABIA said there should be no reporting  to the UNFCCC whatsoever. AOSIS and the EU insisted on keeping  provisions on reporting on the relevant processes to COP-11 and  referring to the submissions of Parties regarding activities  relevant to these processes contained in UNFCCC miscellaneous  documents. Following discussion throughout the afternoon and  evening, Parties agreed on text with deletion of references to  miscellaneous documents, and including text on reporting to SBSTA  on the CSD and BPOA+10 activities.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While ministers participated in the high-level panels on transfer  of technology and mitigation, a group of 'Friends of the  Presidency' met throughout the day and into the night trying to  resolve outstanding issues. Delegates leaving these rooms showed  distress about the slow pace of negotiations on the post-2012  period and expressed concern at the clear endeavors by  oil-producing countries and some non-Parties to the Protocol to  wash down all attempts to address future actions and adaptation  in an effort to protect their industries. The longest faces were  those of LDCs and small island States, who feel they have not  been granted what they were seeking at this COP.
