# SBSTA

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBSTA Chair Halld√≥r Thorgeirsson (Iceland)  welcomed delegates to SBSTA-18. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke  Waller-Hunter said that SBSTA's discussions would shape its future  work programme. MOROCCO, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, appealed for  a focus on adaptation, and emphasized the need to operationalize  funds created under the Protocol and UNFCCC. He also called for a  reversal in the decline in funding for the participation of  developing country delegations, and for the Protocol's entry into  force. The EU said that work on methodologies should ensure the  integrity of inventories. TUVALU, for AOSIS, said that the IPCC  TAR should inform discussions on the development of the climate  regime. SWITZERLAND announced that it had ratified the Kyoto  Protocol on 2 June 2003.

The SBSTA adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/1) without amendment.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Review of methodological work under the  UNFCCC and Protocol: The IPCC reported on its work to revise the  1996 inventory guidelines requested at SBSTA-17. Delegates raised  the need to, inter alia: identify methodological needs from  thematic discussions; distinguish between methodologies for  uniform application and those specific to national circumstances;  and involve a broad range of scientists with expertise on  different issues. Chair Thorgeirsson requested Harald Dovland  (Norway) to facilitate informal consultations and develop  conclusions for SBSTA's consideration.

###     Issues relating to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8

Auden Rosland  (Norway) reported on the workshop held on Article 5.2  (adjustments). He summarised outcomes from discussions on refining  the draft technical guidance on adjustments, and highlighted  tables on conservativeness factors for adjustments to be  considered by SBSTA. SWITZERLAND and the EU underscored the  importance of training reviewers. JAPAN expressed concern about  language requirements for lead reviewers. Chair Thorgeirsson  requested Helen Plume (New Zealand) and Newton Paciornik (Brazil)  to co-chair a contact group to prepare draft SBSTA conclusions and  a draft COP decision.

On Article 7.4 (registries), Murray Ward (New Zealand) summarised  pre-sessional consultations on registries and the transaction log.  He said that the consultations had focused on the elaboration of  data exchange standards and the sharing of experiences regarding  the development of national registries. He underscored the need  for sufficient funding to allow the Secretariat to continue its  work on this issue. Chair Thorgeirsson said Murray Ward would hold  informal consultations on this matter, and prepare draft  conclusions and a draft COP decision.

###     Issues relating to reporting and review of Annex I greenhouse gas  inventories

Chair Thorgeirsson said the issues of training of  expert review team (ERT) members and the treatment of confidential  information would be addressed by the contact group on Articles 5,  7 and 8.

###     LULUCF afforestation and reforestation activities under Protocol  Article 12

Thelma Krug (Brazil) gave an overview of the recent  workshop on modalities and definitions for including afforestation  and reforestation (A&R) project activities under Article 12 (CDM)  in the first commitment period. She said the workshop helped to  prepare draft consolidated text on modalities and definitions  under Article 12. Chair Thorgeirsson noted the Convention on  Biological Diversity work on UNFCCC-related matters and said that  it would affect the work of SB-18 and future sessions. Chair  Thorgeirsson said a contact group on this issue would be co- chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany) and Thelma Krug.

###     Good practice guidance on LULUCF

The IPCC reported on its work on  LULUCF and second-order drafts regarding good practice guidance,  and definitions and methodological options to inventory emissions  from direct human-induced degradation of forests and devegetation  of other vegetation types. He also said work has begun on  methodologies to factor out direct human-induced changes from  indirect and natural effects. Reporting on the work of the  Collaborative Partnership on Forests, the FAO noted the importance  of: consistent forest and carbon-related terminology; rationalized  methods for assessing forest carbon stocks and their changes; and  streamlined reporting. Informal consultations on LULUCF common  reporting issues will be chaired by Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe  (Zimbabwe) and Auden Rosland.

###     Emissions resulting from fuel used in international aviation and  maritime transportation

The International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) stressed the need for more reliable aviation  emission inventories, and described its continuing work on policy  options to limit or reduce aviation emissions; development of  technology and related world-wide emissions standards; reduction  of fuel burn through improved operational measures; and the use of  market-based mechanisms. The International Maritime Organization  (IMO) discussed its work to improve the quality of reporting and  comparability of greenhouse gases from ships and reported on the  informal meeting between the Secretariats of the UNFCCC and IMO.

### IPCC TAR

Scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of  impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change,  and scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation:  MALAYSIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said the TAR's conclusions  should be used cautiously. CHINA noted the 'widespread suspicion  or disagreement' associated with some of the conclusions and  suggested that SBSTA request further comments from the IPCC  regarding those conclusions. SWITZERLAND said that the TAR should  be routinely considered in all agenda items and, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that future annotated agendas should reference  the TAR. AUSTRALIA, with CANADA, the EU and AOSIS, supported  discussions on the TAR as a separate agenda item. AOSIS also noted  that SBSTA had so far failed to successfully integrate the TAR's  findings into its work. CANADA emphasized the need for discussions  on cross-cutting issues relating to both adaptation and mitigation.  A contact group co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and Walid Al- Malik (UAE) will further discuss these issues.

# SBI

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBI Chair Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria)  opened the first meeting of the SBI, and introduced the agenda for  adoption (FCCC/SBI/2003/1). SWITZERLAND, supported by the G-77/CHINA, proposed the inclusion of non-Annex I national  communications on the agenda. The US, supported by CANADA and  AUSTRALIA, and opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed that this item  address the submission of second and subsequent national  communications. Chair Stoycheva agreed to suspend the adoption of  the agenda, in order to allow the G-77/China to consider the US  proposal.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

Progress on the  implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7: The  Secretariat announced a workshop mandated by decision 5/CP.7  (implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9) on possible synergies with  other multilateral environmental conventions and agreements  scheduled for 2-4 July, in Helsinki, Finland.

Chair Stoycheva reported on the recent workshops on insurance- related matters. KUWAIT called for long-term international  solutions to minimizing the adverse effects of response measures.  BURKINA FASO suggested according the insurance industry observer  status in the climate process to enhance their understanding of  the issue. CANADA said the Marrakesh Accords give sufficient  guidance on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7 and stressed the  need to strengthen adaptive capacities and mainstream climate  change adaptation into national sustainable development strategies.  The US and EU underscored the importance of the third GEF  replenishment in supporting developing country work in this regard.  A contact group co-chaired by Fadhel Lari (Kuwait) and Robert  Mason (UK) will consider this item and prepare draft conclusions.

###     Matters relating to LDCs

LDC Expert Group (LEG) Chair Laavasa  Malua (Samoa) reported on the work of the LEG. TANZANIA, for the  LDCs, underscored the need to operationalize the LDC Fund in the  short term to support immediate and urgent needs. CANADA said that  decision guidance should not emphasize any specific adaptation  measures as this might prejudge the outcomes of national  adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). The EU stressed the need  to ensure that NAPA implementation enhances synergies with other  UN conventions.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Chair Stoycheva presented  the interim financial performance for the biennium 2002-2003,  which notes outstanding arrears of US$ 8.5 million and indicates  that two-thirds of member States have not made their contributions  for 2003. Karsten Sach indicated that the German Government had  recently agreed to support and accommodate all Bonn-based UN  agencies at one site. The Executive Secretary presented the draft  programme and budget for the biennium 2004-2005, which contains a  29% budget increase for the 2003-2004 biennium. The Secretariat  estimates that US$ 3.2 million will be required for Protocol  activities, should it enter into force during the 2004-2005  biennium. SAUDI ARABIA emphasized the need for balanced funding in  the biennial budget for items such as workshops. The US requested  more detail on the Secretariat budget and expressed concern over  the proposed apportionment between UNFCCC and Protocol activities.  CANADA supported a 'one-time jump' in the budget.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

Contact group Co-Chair Helen Plume  noted that the group's tasks include addressing criteria for  selection of lead reviewers, the training of ERTs, the treatment  of confidential information, the improvement of the performance  and professionalism of ERTs, and completing technical guidance on  adjustments and discussions on Article 8. On adjustments, Auden  Rosland explained the 'band' approach for calculating  conservativeness factors to control uncertainty within the  uncertainty levels. Delegates also discussed placement of the  information, limiting discretion of the ERTs, and how to address  recalculations with respect to adjustments.

On the treatment of confidential data, the EU, supported by CHINA,  said that confidential information should be available to review  teams during desk reviews and stressed the development of  guidelines for managing electronic information. Delegates also  considered the proposed code of practice for the treatment of  confidential information in the Annex I greenhouse gas inventory  review process. Delegates agreed that both Secretariat staff and  ERT members shall be instructed on responsibilities, and trained  and tested in procedures to protect confidential information.

On agreement for expert review services, SWITZERLAND inquired  about the consequences of disclosing confidential information. Co- Chair Plume said an informal drafting group would meet to work on  adjustments guidance.

### SINKS IN THE CDM

This contact group, co-chaired by Karsten Sach  and Thelma Krug, met briefly in the evening to present the draft  consolidated text on A&R project activities.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

SB-18 got off to a 'lackluster' start Wednesday. The SBI failed to  adopt its agenda because of differences in delegates'  understanding of a potential agenda item on non-Annex I national  communications. Confusion over whether the item should be included  in order to address frequency of submissions, or whether its  inclusion should be to discuss related funding issues indicated  rifts within and between negotiating groups. Together with the  introduction of debate on budget issues, SB-18 has so far signaled  that financial concerns will probably feature significantly in  discussions during the coming week and a half.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### SBI

The SBI will meet from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm in Plenary to  adopt the agenda and discuss, among other things, administrative  and financial matters, arrangements for intergovernmental meetings,  non-Annex I financial matters, and capacity building.

### SBSTA

The SBSTA will convene from 3:00 to 6:00 pm to take up  policies and measures, technology transfer, research and  systematic observation and cooperation with relevant international  organizations, and other matters.

### INFORMAL GROUPS

Informal contact groups will meet on the IPCC TAR,  and sinks in the CDM.
