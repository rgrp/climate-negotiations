# OPENING PLENARY

In the opening address Angela Merkel, Federal Minister for  the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety  (Germany) and COP-1 President said the time-frames specified  by the Berlin Mandate are very ambitious. A convergence of  views on central issues is not yet in sight. The Second  Assessment Report (SAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC) is alarming. The results of the review  of the first national communications of Annex 1 Parties are  a matter of concern. Fifteen developed countries with 55% of  the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions of the group currently  expect emissions levels by the year 2000 to exceed those of  1990. She called for ambitious reduction targets in the  short and medium term. The credibility of all Parties is at  stake.

She then introduced Item 2 of the Provisional Agenda, the  election of the COP President Chen Chimutengwende, Minister  of Environment and Tourism (Zimbabwe), was elected by  acclamation. He said outstanding issues include reporting by  Annex 1 Parties, preparation of guidelines for submission of  initial communications by non-Annex 1 Parties, new and  additional financial resources to meet the agreed full  incremental costs incurred by developing country Parties,  the role of the GEF, and the role of activities implemented  jointly and other mechanisms. He invited heads of  delegations to a roundtable on 17 July on political issues  arising from the agenda.

Nitin Desai, UN Under-Secretary General delivered the  message of the UN Secretary General. Noting recent strides  in understanding the science of climate change, he urged  Parties to strengthen earlier commitments. Climate change is  a global issue that cannot be solved without a global effort  undertaken in a cooperative and integrated manner. He noted  the complementary nature of Agenda 21, the Rio Declaration,  and the FCCC and encouraged parties to acknowledge linkages  among the three in revising their commitments.

Claude Haegi, State Counselor of Geneva, stated that  political and economic decisions cannot be made in isolation  but must consider human impacts on the environment. He  stressed the need to modify current energy consumption and  production patterns and to use all energy sources, with the  aim of developing clean and renewable sources.

Michael Zammit Cutajar, FCCC Executive Secretary, noted that  sharper definition of FCCC goals and a timetable in which  they should be accomplished is needed. He called on the COP  to provide better guidance to the GEF and not to overlook  Articles 5 (research) and 6 (education), suggesting that  UNEP take the lead in overseeing the implementation of  Article 6.

G.O.P. Obasi, Secretary General of WMO, said the SAR  provides evidence that makes the FCCC an absolute necessity.  He called for: completion of negotiations on the  stabilization of CO2 emissions; provision of a solid  scientific basis for deliberations by the subsidiary bodies;  reinforcement of national capabilities to provide data; and  consideration of assistance to developing countries and  those with economies in transition to enable them to limit  emissions. He also noted the need to fund the Climate  Agenda, an initiative to establish a framework for  international climate-related scientific programmes.

Elizabeth Dowdeswell, Executive Director of UNEP, noted that  the lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as  an excuse to postpone action and that the atmosphere will  continue to change until Parties choose to control their  emissions. She called for a global emission cap, access to  financial mechanisms and technology transfer for developing  countries, and access to reliable information by decision  makers. She noted opportunities for action, including:  reaping the benefits of integrated resource management;  ensuring rationality in actions to protect the environment;  engaging the private sector and civil society; and analyzing  market and non-market mechanisms.

Bert Bolin, Chair of the IPCC, reiterated the conclusion of  the SAR that suggests 'a discernable human influence on  global climate.' He highlighted: masking of global warming  by aerosol emissions; emission limits necessary to stabilize  carbon dioxide concentrations; additional IPCC papers on  climate stabilisation, environmental implications of  emissions limitations and policies and measures; and  critical evaluation of the SAR. He objected to criticism  that the IPCC had violated its procedures in preparation of  the SAR.

Mohamed El-Ashry, Chair and CEO of the GEF, stated that  between February 1995 and April 1996, the GEF Council  approved US$215 million for climate change activities. He  emphasized that the recently adopted GEF Operational  Strategy contained a chapter on climate change that had been  developed under COP-1 guidance. He called upon COP-2 to  consider the permanent financial mechanism of the FCCC.

Robert Priddle, Executive Director of the International  Energy Agency of the OECD, focused on the Berlin Mandate. He  highlighted the long time necessary to achieve  infrastructural change in the energy sector, calling for  long term commitments from Annex I countries including  policy instruments and funding for research and development.

Anders Wijkman, UNDP, called on governments to create a  level playing field between all energy suppliers, enforce  the polluter pays principle, and focus research and  development on increasing energy efficiency and identifying  renewable energy sources. He said OECD countries should  provide a leadership role and that the GEF should be  strengthened.

Assad Kotaite, Executive Director of the International Civil  Aviation Organisation (ICAO), highlighted the need for  cooperation between the ICAO and developed countries, noting  that unilateral measures for addressing aircraft emissions  should be avoided. The greatest obstacle to progress is the  lack of a scientific assessment on the impact of emissions.  Once an assessment is completed, the extent to which  technology can be used to remedy the effects can be  determined.

The President then sought adoption of the programme of work.  The RUSSIAN FEDERATION proposed that the Plenary be extended  to allow the parties to determine how the SAR should be used  in making decisions, particularly regarding the Berlin  Mandate and how countries will fulfill their obligations. He  said these decisions should not be made by subsidiary  bodies. The Executive Secretary noted items 3,4(a) and (b)  of the provisional agenda for the SBSTA stipulate that  subsidiary bodies will make initial recommendations on which  the Parties will vote. The out-going SBSTA Chair, Tibor  Farago, said his group would report its  findings on the SAR  to the COP. SAUDI ARABIA cautioned against a selective  approach to the SAR findings before SBSTA's report.

Parties proceeded to the adoption of the Agenda  (FCCC/CP/1996/1). Under Item 4 (a) on National  Communications from Parties Included in Annex 1, the  President reported that the United Republic of Tanzania and  Qatar are to become signatories to the FCCC before the end  of the Conference, and Israel will become a non-Annex 1  Party in August. The Czech Republic, Morocco, and Slovakia  have applied to become Annex 1 Parties. Introducing Agenda  Item 4 (b), Adoption of the Rules of Procedure, the  President said he would conduct consultations to resolve the  issue of rule 42 (voting). SAUDI ARABIA said agreement on  rule 22 (election of officers) is also pending.  Rule 22  should be limited to regional group representatives. The  President said each of the five regional groups are to be  represented by two Bureau members and one Bureau member will  represent the small island developing states (SIDS). SAUDI  ARABIA objected to the nomination of a Bureau member from  Samoa to represent SIDS. The US said it was important to  follow precedent in the election of officers to the Bureau  and include the SIDS nominee. Parties proceeded to the  election of the Bureau. GERMANY said the SIDS were  represented in the Bureau of the INC in 1991. SAUDI ARABIA  said he could not support the elections as proposed. The  President postponed the election of vice-presidents.

Delegates then agreed on the admission of intergovernmental  and non-governmental organisations as observers. Some  delegations then returned to the election of officers and  requested clarification. The Executive Secretary stated that  the COP had elected a president in the morning session and,  in the afternoon, heard nominations for 10 other members of  the Bureau. For 6 of the 7 Vice-Presidents, delegates  received the nominations of Alexander Bedritsky (Russian  Federation) Rene Castro (Costa Rica), John Ashe (Antigua and  Barbuda), Anthony Clark (Canada), Cornelia Quennet-Theilen  (Germany) and Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa). Delegates also  received the nominations of Mohamed M. Ould El Ghaouth  (Mauritania) as SBI Chair and Tibor Farago (Hungary) as  SBSTA Chair. The representatives of the Asian Group  presented nominations from Kuwait and the Philippines, but  had not agreed which representative would serve as  Rapporteur and which as Vice-President. Delegates then  discussed rule 22 as applied and a number of possibilities  were put forward. It was suggested that the Parties elect  the two officers for SBSTA and SBI. Regarding the other  posts, he noted that the group now has the 'beginnings' of a  Bureau. He also noted that the two ad hoc groups, AGBM and  AG13, already had chairs. SBSTA and SBI have only chairs and  the COP has a president. SAMOA questioned how the COP could  proceed with only part of the Bureau. The President said  that he will conduct consultations and resume the Plenary  later to discuss this item.

The Executive Secretary then discussed documentation for  COP-2, and called for a more rational work load spread  through 1997. The President described the allocation of work  among the subsidiary bodies, and called upon the SBSTA Chair  to report on the technical advisory panels. The Chair  reported that SBSTA could not agree on modalities for the  TAPs.

The President stated that he would consult with the Chairs  of the subsidiary bodies on the division of labor between  SBSTA and SBI, in preparation for a formal decision to be  taken at COP-3.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

An informal meeting held last week in Frankfurt, sponsored  by the government of Germany, formed the basis for closer  cooperation between the secretariats of the Convention on  Biological Diversity (CBD) and the GEF. According to one  participant, relations between the GEF and the CBD are  complicated by language in the convention stating that the  GEF shall operate under the 'authority' of the CBD, as well  as by the absence of an intersessional mechanism to discuss  financial issues (unlike the FCCC). The meeting established  a process for consultations between the two bodies in a  revised Memorandum of Understanding.
