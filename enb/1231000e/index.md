# PLENARY

The COP met in Plenary to discuss Agenda Items 4(d) and  4(f), election of officers other than the President, and the  Ministerial Segment. The President reported that  consultations on the rules of procedure would continue as  new proposals have been introduced. Application of the draft  rules will continue until a consensus is reached. The  following delegates were elected: Alexander Bedritsky  (Russian Federation), Rene Castro Hernandez (Costa Rica),  John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda), Anthony Clark (Canada),  Cornelia Quennet-Thielen (Germany), Tuiloma Neroni Slade  (Samoa), and Abbas Naqi (Kuwait) as vice-presidents, and  Antonio La Vi√±a (Philippines) as Rapporteur. SAUDI ARABIA  and KUWAIT expressed concern about the COP's failure to  adopt rules of procedure and said that a compromise must be  reached soon.

The upcoming ministerial segment will consist of three  plenary sessions and one informal roundtable meeting to be  chaired by Ruth Dreifuss (Switzerland). Plenary statements  will be limited to five minutes and entry to the roundtable  will be restricted to heads of delegations at the  ministerial level. SAUDIA ARABIA, supported by the REPUBLIC  OF KOREA, the US, IRAN and BANGLADESH, objected to  restricting the roundtable to ministers, saying all heads of  delegations should be welcome regardless of rank. To do  otherwise would prejudice those delegations not able to send  ministers. Increased transparency for the roundtable was  also recommended. The President agreed to consider the  recommendations and report back to the COP.

# AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13

The Ad Hoc Group on Article 13 met in the morning to discuss  a multilateral consultative process (MCP). Under Agenda item  3 (election of officers other than the Chair), the Chair  explained that the COP President is involved in discussions  to agree on a balanced list for subsidiary bodies. Under  item 4(a) (panel summary), the Chair recommended that his  report on a panel presentation become an annex to the  Session report. The US noted that elements are not listed in  order of priority. Under item 4(b) (synthesis), participants  adopted a synthesis of responses to a questionnaire on  establishing a MCP under Article 13 (FCCC/AG13/1996/1) to be  considered at the Group's December session. The EU regretted  that substantive discussions will be postponed until then.  He recommended a draft decision extending the AG-13 mandate  to COP-3 and a role in examining ways to apply a MCP to a  protocol in cooperation with AGBM. Under item 4(c) (draft  decisions), the Chair recommended draft decisions on the  continuation of AG-13 and inviting the Group to report to  COP-3. The Chair accepted a Saudi Arabia proposal to replace  a reference to the possible design of a MCP with one on  reporting to the COP as instructed.

The meeting then considered the Chair's draft text on  linkages between AG-13 and AGBM. The text stated that AGBM  should take into account advice on a MCP, from AG-13, if it  decides that such a process should apply to a 'protocol'.  Several delegations objected that referring to both a  protocol and a MCP as part of this protocol prejudged the  work of AGBM. Some delegations stated that other subsidiary  bodies should be encouraged as well, though not required, to  consult with AG-13 should they identify a need for a MCP.  Final wording of a redrafted text, as amended by SOUTH  AFRICA and the US, removes all reference to a protocol and  asks the COP to decide that the AGBM may, in its  consideration of a MCP, seek such advice as may be deemed  necessary from AG-13.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

SBI met formally to consider Agenda item 4 (financial and  technical cooperation). The Secretariat introduced the GEF  Report to COP-2 (FCCC/CP/1996/8), which considers the  relationship between the GEF and the COP. The Secretariat  also introduced a draft Annex to the draft Memorandum of  Understanding between the GEF and COP (MOU) on determination  of necessary funding and its availability for implementation  of the FCCC (FCCC/CP/1996/9).

The G-77/CHINA requested a postponement of discussion. The  EU and the US welcomed the GEF report, especially the  operational strategy and its emphasis on enabling  activities, and, along with POLAND, supported designation of  the GEF as the permanent funding mechanism. FRANCE cautioned  that failure to approve the funding document might hinder  input from the COP to the next GEF replenishment. The Chair  postponed discussion until Thursday.

Under Agenda Item 4(b) on Secretariat activities relating to  technical and financial support to the Parties  (FCCC/SBI/1996/10), the Secretariat reported on an extended  mandate on preparing communications from non-Annex 1  Parties, including the Climate Convention Information  Exchange Programme, training provision, and financial  considerations. The US requested further information on the  Secretariat's cooperation with the UNDP, and encouraged  close cooperation with the GEF Secretariat, other agencies  and bilateral donors.

The EU suggested a draft decision on the need for voluntary  contributions to support the Secretariat's activities. Under  Agenda item 3(a), the Secretariat introduced a compilation  of national communications from Annex 1 Parties  (FCCC/CP/1996/12 and Adds.1 and 2) and a report on  experiences and results of the review process on submission  of communications (FCCC/CP/1996/13). The SBI was invited to  consider the report in detail and convey conclusions to the  AGBM and COP-2. In-depth reviews are available from Japan,  Spain and Norway. Reports from Denmark and the Netherlands  will be available soon.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

Debate resumed on Agenda Item 4(a) (national communications  from Annex I Parties). The G-77/CHINA, supported by COLOMBIA  and INDIA, proposed Annex I parties communicate GHG emission  limitations and commitments related to financial resources  and technology transfer. ESTONIA, supported by LATVIA and  the REPUBLIC OF KOREA, said guidelines should be revised  with flexibility.

MOROCCO stated that Annex I Parties should also be required  to report on capacity building mechanisms and encouraged a  paragraph by paragraph review of the document. NEW ZEALAND  sought increased transparency in the reporting process and  suggested the formation of a contact group to revise  reporting guidelines.

The MARSHALL ISLANDS and MICRONESIA highlighted the need for  information related to technology transfer for adaptation.  UZBEKISTAN said the guidelines should contain more detail,  including guidelines for emission control. NORWAY and CANADA  suggested introducing their proposals for technical  revisions in a contact group. CHINA noted that Annex I  Parties are committed to assisting developing countries  through technology transfer and financial assistance, but  this has not been highlighted in the documents revision.

The Secretariat introduced additional documents for the  agenda item: methodological issues (FCCC/SBSTA/  1996/9/Add.1) and electricity trade and bunker fuels  (Add.2). The Chair noted he would convene a contact group on  these issues. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION drew attention to  problems with net emissions and noted the absence of a  recognized principle on accounting for timber exports. The  EU stressed that allocation issues cannot be isolated from  development of policies and measures for GHG emissions, and  suggested that AGBM should elaborate policies and measures  on bunker fuel emissions.

On Agenda Item 4(b) (national communications from non-Annex  I Parties), the Chair proposed a contact group. He also  formed a contact group for Annex I Party communications. For  the Chair's summary of deliberations on the SAR, he proposed  convening a 'friends of the Chair' group.

SBSTA then considered Agenda Item 7 (mechanisms for  consultations with NGOs). The President introduced the  relevant documents (FCCC/SBSTA/1996/11 and FCCC/SBSTA/1996/  Misc.2). The EU, supported by JAPAN, strongly supported the  role of NGOs and remained open to tailoring different  mechanisms for different NGO constituencies. The US said  expanding access to only one type of NGO would be  inappropriate and suggested strengthening existing channels.  NEW ZEALAND urged the development of a special consultative  mechanism for business NGOs as they will play a vital role  in implementation. CANADA supported a business consultative  mechanism if it will facilitate implementation  and opposed  open access to NGOs on the floor during negotiations.

CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK sought equitable participation among  all NGOs, enhancement of existing consultative mechanisms  and expanded access to the floor during negotiations.  INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE supported the development  of a business consultative mechanism, noting the importance  of business input in implementation and acknowledging the  need for transparency. The President urged New Zealand to  take the lead in forming a contact group to make  recommendations to SBSTA on the issue.

Delegates then considered activities implemented jointly  under the pilot phase. The Secretariat introduced an annual  review of progress (FCCC/CP/1996/14 and Add.1). The G-77/CHINA and the EU were not prepared to speak on the issue.  CANADA said SBSTA should not significantly change the  reporting format at this session. She endorsed continuation  at the pilot phase, with further assessment at COP-3. The US  recommended adoption of the Progress Report and Addendum as  the first annual report on AIJ, and expressed willingness to  host the initial workshop on methodological issues as  proposed by the Secretariat. She supported the formation of  an AIJ forum, and suggested that Parties provide submissions  for annual reports three months in advance. JAPAN suggested  standard operational procedures for AIJ projects, monitoring  and revision and supported the workshop on methodologies.

The REPUBLIC OF KOREA called for systematic improvement of  AIJ to improve research and development capacity. The  NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REGULATORY UTILITY COMMISSIONERS  stated that AIJ should be a permanent part of the FCCC.  SWITZERLAND described plans to finance pilot AIJ projects  with Annex II partners.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

At an informal meeting of participants in the Subsidiary  Body for Implementation (SBI), Parties agreed to review a  Secretariat proposal to raise capital reserves from 8.3% to  15% at COP-3, as well as outstanding questions regarding  relocation to Bonn, liaison points in New York and Geneva,  and the budget.
