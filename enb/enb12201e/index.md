# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  the world's environment, with negative impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the Earth's atmosphere  are leading to a change in the climate. According to the IPCC, the  effects of climate change have already been observed. Despite some  lingering uncertainties, a majority of scientists believe that  precautionary and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Adopted in  1992, the UNFCCC sets out a framework for action aimed at  stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to  avoid 'dangerous interference' with the climate system. The  greenhouse gases to be limited include methane, nitrous oxide, and,  in particular, carbon dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21  March 1994. It now has 186 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, whose task was to reach agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  to achieve quantified emission reduction targets. These countries,  known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to  reducing their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at  least 5% below 1990 levels over the period 2008 and 2012 (the  first commitment period), with specific targets varying from  country to country. The Protocol also established three mechanisms  to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost- effectively - an emissions trading system, joint implementation  (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties, and  a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to encourage projects in non- Annex I (developing country) Parties.

It was left for subsequent meetings to decide on most of the rules  and operational details that determine how these cuts in emissions  will be achieved and how countries' efforts will be measured and  assessed. To enter into force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55  Parties to the UNFCCC, including Annex I Parties representing at  least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990. To date,  96 Parties have ratified the Protocol, including 26 Annex I  Parties, representing a total of 37.4% of the emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

At COP-4, which met in Buenos  Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, Parties set a schedule for  reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and  for strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC itself. In a  decision known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA),  delegates agreed that the deadline for reaching agreement should  be COP-6. Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution  included rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing  Parties' compliance, and accounting methods for national emissions  and emissions reductions. Rules on crediting countries for carbon  sinks were also to be addressed. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the Netherlands,  from 13-25 November 2000. Political positions on the key issues  remained entrenched, with little indication of a willingness to  compromise. During the second week of negotiations, COP-6  President Jan Pronk (the Netherlands) attempted to facilitate  negotiations on the many disputed political and technical issues  by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions. He grouped the  issues into the following four 'clusters' or 'boxes': (a) capacity  building, technology transfer, adverse effects and guidance to the  financial mechanism; (b) mechanisms; (c) LULUCF; and, (d)  compliance, P&Ms, and accounting, reporting and review under  Protocol Articles 5 ,7 and 8. After almost 36 hours of intense  talks in the final two days, negotiators could not achieve an  agreement, with financial issues, supplementarity in the use of  the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF proving particularly  difficult. On Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk  announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement. Delegates  agreed to suspend COP-6, and expressed a willingness to resume in  2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  Protocol, stating that it considered the Protocol to be 'fatally  flawed,' as it would damage its economy and exempt developing  countries from emission targets. Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part  II and the fourteenth sessions of the subsidiary bodies, which met  in Bonn, Germany, from 16-27 July 2001. After protracted  consultations, President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft  political decision. Several Parties announced that they could  support the political decision, but disagreements surfaced over  the nature of the compliance regime. After several days of  consultations, ministers finally agreed to adopt the original  political decision, with a revised section on compliance. The  political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - was formally adopted  by the COP on 25 July 2001.

Although draft decisions were approved on a number of key issues,  no agreement was reached on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF.  Since not all texts in the 'package' of decisions were completed,  all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates met for COP-7 and the fifteenth sessions of the  subsidiary bodies in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October - 10  November 2001. The main goal was to complete tasks left unfinished  at COP-6 Parts I and II, thereby bringing to a close three years  of negotiations. The Bonn Agreements served as the basis for the  work.

After protracted bilateral and multilateral talks, a package deal  on LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8, and input to  the WSSD was proposed on Thursday evening, 8 November. Although  the deal was accepted by most regional groups, including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose alliance of Annex  I Parties that includes Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and  the Russian Federation) did not join the consensus. They disputed,  among other things, eligibility requirements and bankability under  the mechanisms. However, following extensive negotiations, the  Marrakesh Accords were agreed, with key features including  consideration of LULUCF Principles and limited banking of units  generated by sinks under the CDM.

### SB-16

Parties met in the sixteenth sessions of the subsidiary  bodies from 5-14 June 2002, in Bonn. The meeting considered a  range of issues previously left off the agenda due to the pressing  BAPA negotiations. Views on the direction of the climate process  varied greatly, with some Parties looking backward to recent  debates and others looking ahead toward the next commitment period.  Many expressed their hope that the Protocol could enter into force  by the August 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD),  with the EU and Japan announcing their ratifications just prior to  the Summit. Several draft decisions were agreed and forwarded to  COP-8 to be considered and adopted.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### WSSD

From 26 August to 4 September 2002, the WSSD was held in  Johannesburg, South Africa. The WSSD adopted text identifying the  UNFCCC as the 'key' instrument for addressing climate change,  reaffirming the UNFCCC's ultimate objective, and emphasizing the  importance of developing cleaner technologies in key sectors such  as energy. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation also makes  reference to timely ratification of the Protocol by those states  who have not yet done so. Delegates agreed on further text  identifying actions to address climate change, such as providing  technical and financial assistance to developing countries, and  countries with economies in transition.

### RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

With terrorism high on the international  agenda, the climate change threat may not be at the fore of global  political attention. Yet, many eagerly await the Protocol's entry  into force. Canada, China, and the Russian Federation declared  their intentions to ratify the Protocol during the WSSD and, since  June 2002, an additional 22 Parties have ratified the Protocol.  With Russia's ratification, the total percentage of Annex I  emissions will be 54.8%, 0.2 percent away from the required 55%.  Assuming the Protocol enters into force by early 2003, Annex I  Parties will have less than ten years to meet their emissions  targets set for the first commitment period. The issue of future  commitments already looms over the negotiations.
