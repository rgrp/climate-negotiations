abstract: "The Fifth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP-5) to the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) met  in Bonn, Germany, from 25 October - 5 November 1999. With over  3000 participants in attendance and 165 Parties represented,  delegates continued their work toward fulfilling the Buenos Aires  Plan of Action (BAPA) adopted at the Fourth Conference of the  Parties (COP-4) in November 1998. Under the BAPA, Parties set a  two-year deadline for strengthening FCCC implementation and  preparing for the future entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol."
---

During the course of COP-5, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation  (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological  Advice (SBSTA) were assisted in their work by eight contact  groups, a joint SBI/SBSTA working group and numerous informal  consultations. During its last two days, COP-5 adopted 32 draft  decisions and conclusions. on, inter alia, the review of the  implementation of commitments and other FCCC provisions and  preparations for the first session of the COP serving as the  Meeting of Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP-1). Ninety-three  ministers and other heads of delegation addressed COP-5 during a  high-level segment held from 2 - 3 November. Delegates completed  their work ahead of schedule and generated an 'unexpected mood of  optimism' in the lead-up to COP-6. After a faltering COP in Buenos  Aires, the process recovered vital momentum and began to gather  determination and support for a self-imposed deadline for entry  into force of the Protocol by 2002.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

The FCCC was adopted on 9 May 1992, and was opened for signature  at the UN Conference on Environment and Development in June 1992.  The FCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, 90 days after  receipt of the 50th ratification. To date, 180 countries have  ratified the Convention.

### COP-1

The First Conference of the Parties to the FCCC (COP-1)  took place in Berlin from 28 March - 7 April 1995. In addition to  addressing a number of important issues related to the future of  the FCCC, delegates reached agreement on what many believed to be  the central issue before COP-1 - adequacy of commitments, the  'Berlin Mandate.' Delegates agreed to establish an open-ended Ad  Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate (AGBM) to begin a process toward  appropriate action for the period beyond 2000, including the  strengthening of the commitments of Annex I Parties through the  adoption of a protocol or other legal instrument. COP-1 also  requested the Secretariat to make arrangements for sessions of the  subsidiary bodies on scientific and technological advice (SBSTA)  and implementation (SBI). SBSTA serves as the link between the  information provided by competent international bodies, and the  policy-oriented needs of the COP. SBI was created to develop  recommendations to assist the COP in the review and assessment of  the implementation of the FCCC and in the preparation and  implementation of its decisions.

### AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13

The Ad Hoc Group on Article 13  (resolution of questions regarding implementation) was set up to  consider the establishment of a multilateral consultative process  (MCP) available to Parties to resolve questions on implementation.  At its fifth session, Parties agreed that the MCP should be  advisory rather than supervisory in nature and AG13 should  complete its work by COP-4.

### AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE/COP-2

The AGBM met eight times  between August 1995 and COP-3 in December 1997. During the first  three sessions, delegates focused on analyzing and assessing  possible policies and measures to strengthen the commitments of  Annex I Parties, how Annex I countries might distribute or share  new commitments and whether commitments should take the form of an  amendment or protocol. AGBM-4, which coincided with COP-2 in  Geneva in July 1996, completed its in-depth analysis of the likely  elements of a protocol, and Parties appeared ready to prepare a  negotiating text. At AGBM-5, which met in December 1996, delegates  recognized the need to decide whether or not to allow mechanisms  that would provide Annex I Parties with flexibility in meeting  quantified emissions limitation and reduction objectives (QELROs).

As the protocol was drafted during the sixth and seventh sessions  of the AGBM, in March and August 1997, respectively, delegates  'streamlined' a framework compilation text by merging or  eliminating some overlapping provisions within the myriad of  proposals. Much of the discussion centered on a proposal from the  EU for a 15% emissions cut for a 'basket' of three greenhouse  gases (GHGs) by the year 2010 compared to 1990 levels. In October  1997, as AGBM-8 began, US President Bill Clinton included a call  for 'meaningful participation' by developing countries in the  negotiating position he announced in Washington. The insistence on  G-77/China involvement was linked to the level of ambition  acceptable by the US and, in response, the G-77/China distanced  themselves from attempts to draw developing countries into  agreeing to anything that could be interpreted as new commitments.

### COP-3

The Third Conference of the Parties (COP-3) was held from  1-11 December 1997 in Kyoto, Japan. Over 10,000 participants,  including representatives from governments, IGOs, NGOs and the  media, attended the Conference, which included a high-level  segment featuring statements from over 125 ministers. Following a  week and a half of intense formal and informal negotiations,  including a session that began on the final evening and lasted  into the following day, Parties to the FCCC adopted the Kyoto  Protocol on 11 December. In the Kyoto Protocol, Annex I Parties to  the FCCC agreed to commitments with a view to reducing their  overall emissions of six GHGs by at least 5% below 1990 levels  between 2008 and 2012. The Protocol also established emissions  trading and 'joint implementation' (JI) between developed  countries, and a 'clean development mechanism' (CDM) to encourage  joint emissions reduction projects between developed and  developing countries. The Protocol will enter into force 90 days  after it is ratified by 55 States, including Annex I Parties  representing at least 55% per cent of total carbon dioxide  emissions by Annex I Parties for 1990. As of 25 October 1999, 84  FCCC Parties had signed the Kyoto Protocol and 16 had ratified it.

### POST-KYOTO SUBSIDIARY BODIES MEETINGS

The subsidiary bodies of  the FCCC met from 2-12 June 1998 in Bonn. SBSTA-8 agreed to draft  conclusions on, inter alia, cooperation with relevant  international organizations, methodological issues, and education  and training. SBI-8 reached conclusions on, inter alia, Annex I  and non-Annex I national communications, the financial mechanism  and the second review of adequacy of Annex I Parties' commitments.  At its sixth session, AG13 concluded its work on the functions of  the MCP. After joint SBI/SBSTA consideration and extensive contact  group debates on the flexibility mechanisms, delegates could only  agree to a compilation document containing proposals from the G-77/China, the EU and the US on the issues for discussion and  framework for implementation.

### COP-4

The Fourth Conference of the Parties (COP-4) was held from  2-13 November 1998 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, with over 5,000  participants in attendance. During the two-week meeting, delegates  deliberated decisions for the COP during SBI-9 and SBSTA-9. Issues  related to the Kyoto Protocol were considered in joint SBI/SBSTA  sessions. A high-level segment, which heard statements from over  100 ministers and heads of delegation, was convened on Thursday,  12 November. Following hours of high-level 'closed door'  negotiations and a final plenary session that concluded early  Saturday morning, delegates adopted the Buenos Aires Plan of  Action (BAPA). Under the BAPA, the Parties declared their  determination to strengthen the implementation of the FCCC and  prepare for the future entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. The  Plan contains the Parties' resolution to demonstrate substantial  progress on: the financial mechanism; the development and transfer  of technology; the implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9  (adverse effects), as well as Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14  (adverse effects); AIJ; the Protocol mechanisms; and preparations  for COP/MOP-1.

### SBI-10 AND SBSTA-10

The FCCC subsidiary bodies held their tenth  sessions in Bonn, Germany, from 31 May - 11 June 1999, and began  the process of fulfilling the BAPA. SBSTA considered topics such  as Annex I communications, methodological issues and the  development and transfer of technology. SBI discussed, inter alia,  administrative and financial matters and non-Annex I  communications. SBI and SBSTA jointly considered the mechanisms of  the Kyoto Protocol, AIJ and compliance. A joint SBI/SBSTA Working  Group on compliance (JWG) discussed identification of compliance- related elements, including gaps and suitable forums to address  them; design of a compliance system; and consequences of non- compliance.

# REPORT OF COP-5

COP-4 President Maria Julia Alsogaray (Argentina) opened COP-5 on  Monday, 25 October 1999, and emphasized the need for political  will to fulfill the BAPA and allow for the Protocol to enter into  force by Rio+10 in 2002.

Jan Szyszko, Poland's Minister of Environmental Protection,  Natural Resources and Forestry, was then elected President of COP- 5. He said the operation of the Protocol mechanisms, compliance,  and guidance to COP/MOP-1 should be resolved by COP-6. He noted  the need to identify alternatives that lower implementation- related costs for developing countries.

German Chancellor Gerhard SchrÃ¶der noted that, despite the  establishment of the FCCC, there have been setbacks in the climate  process, including the inability of most industrialized countries  to reduce their CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. He  said the Protocol should enter into force in time for Rio+10 in  2002 and urged Parties to implement their pledges in international  fora.

FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar, on behalf of UN  Secretary-General Kofi Annan, stressed the need for urgent action  if the Kyoto commitments are to be met. He called for sensitivity  to the needs of vulnerable countries and financial empowerment of  developing countries. Assuring the COP of UN support, he said the  global community wished to see the CDM activated after COP-6 and  the Protocol ratified by 2002.

# ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

### ADOPTION OF AGENDA

Following the opening statements, the COP  adopted its agenda (FCCC/CP/1999/1) with the exception of item 5  relating to the second review of the adequacy of commitments under  FCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b) (policies and measures by Annex I  Parties), following objections to the title by the G-77/CHINA, who  preferred to substitute it with the 'review of adequacy of  implementation of FCCC Articles 4.2(a) and (b).' It also adopted  the proposed organization of its work (FCCC/CP/1999/1/Add.1).

On Friday, 5 November, President Szyszko reported that no  agreement had been reached during informal consultations convened  to resolve item 5. The COP adopted the agenda including item 5 as  it stood, and recorded the amendment proposed by the G-77/CHINA in  a footnote. President Szyszko said this item would be taken up by  COP-6 in accordance with the provisional rules of procedure, and  gaveled the adoption of this decision. The Alliance of Small  Island States (AOSIS) expressed concern about this decision and  said there was no excuse for the COP not to carry out this review.  The EU made a distinction between FCCC Article 4.2(d) (review of  the adequacy of commitments), which is the way forward for the COP  to operate a review of Article 4.2(a) and (b) on a regular basis,  and FCCC Article 7.2 (review of FCCC implementation), which covers  the review of implementation of the current commitments. She added  that the IPCC Third Assessment Report should serve as the basis  for assessing the level of GHG that would prevent dangerous  anthropogenic interference with the climate system and the time  frame to reach stabilization of GHG in the atmosphere at that  level.

### STATUS OF RATIFICATION

Delegates considered the status of  ratification of the FCCC and the Kyoto Protocol in Plenary, noting  that 179 States and one regional economic integration organization  were Parties to the FCCC, and that 16 of these had ratified or  acceded to the Kyoto Protocol.

### RULES OF PROCEDURE

President Szyszko noted during the opening  Plenary that Parties had yet to reach a consensus on the rules of  procedure. The COP decided to apply the draft rules  (FCCC/CP/1996/2) used in previous sessions, with the exception of  draft rule 42 (voting). President Szyzsko reported back to the COP  on Thursday, 4 November, that, despite informal consultations,  consensus on the rules had not been achieved. Delegates agreed to  defer the issue to COP-6.

### ELECTION OF OFFICERS

The COP elected its Bureau members. The Vice  Presidents elected were: Liu Zhenmin (China), Papa Cham (the  Gambia), Yvo de Boer (Netherlands), Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa),  Mohammad Salem Al-Sabban (Saudi Arabia), Philip Gwage (Uganda),  and Olexander Bielov (Ukraine). The COP elected Antonio JosÃ©  Vallim Guerreiro (Brazil) as Rapporteur, John Ashe (Antigua and  Barbuda) as Chair of SBI and Harald Dovland (Norway) as Chair of  SBSTA.

### ADMISSION OF OBSERVERS AND ORGANIZATION OF WORK

COP-5 admitted as  observers two IGOs and 36 NGOs (FCCC/CP/1999/4 and Add.1).

### DATE AND VENUE OF COP-6

The date and venue of COP-6 was  considered by the SBI on Wednesday, 27 October, and Monday, 1  November. During SBI discussions, the G-77/CHINA proposed holding  COP-6 in November 2000, while the US, with CANADA, AUSTRALIA and  NEW ZEALAND, preferred early 2001. The COP adopted a decision  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.9) on Thursday, 4 November, that accepts the  Netherlands' offer to host COP-6, and decides that the meeting  will be held in The Hague from 13 - 24 November 2000.

### CALENDAR OF MEETINGS, 2000 - 2003

The calendar of meetings for  FCCC bodies for 2000-2003 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.12) was adopted by the  COP on Thursday, 4 November, following recommendation to the COP  by SBI on Monday, 1 November. The calendar sets three sessional  periods for 2000: 12-16 June and 11-15 September, each preceded by  week-long informal meetings, followed by COP-6 in November. Two  sessional periods are scheduled for each of the following years to  2003.

# REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Guidelines for the Preparation of National  Communications from Annex I Parties: This item was considered by  SBI and SBSTA and referred to a joint working group. SBI and SBSTA  adopted draft conclusions on Monday, 1 November, and the COP  adopted a decision on Thursday 4, November.

SBSTA considered this sub-item on Monday, 25 October. The EU noted  the need to include indicators such as emissions per capita or  emissions per unit of output. Regarding the draft guidance for  reporting on global climate observation systems, the EU, with  MONGOLIA, recommended that Annex I Parties prepare a separate  report and include in their national communications a summary  based on general reporting requirements. AUSTRALIA suggested that  projections of the effect of policies and measures on future  trends of GHG emissions and removals be developed by sector. The  MARSHALL ISLANDS and JAMAICA supported detailed and rigorous  reporting. The US said the quantity and level of detail should  balance needs for comparability, transparency and practicality. A  joint SBI-SBSTA contact group chaired by Jim Penman (UK) and Mark  Mwandosya (Tanzania) was established to consider Part II of the  guidelines.

On Wednesday, 27 October, SBI decided to consider the guidelines  for the preparation of national communications from Annex I  Parties after SBSTA had arrived at conclusions on the revisions to  Part II of the guidelines.

The joint contact group met from 26-29 October. Delegates agreed  to delete the section on coverage and the EU submitted a proposal  to restructure the section on national circumstances. On the  selection of policies and measures, the group agreed on the  differentiation of policies 'adopted,' 'implemented' and at a  'planning stage,' for reporting purposes and called for  definitions of these terms.

On the projections and the total effect of policies and measures,  delegates invited the Chair to settle the terminology of  projections 'without measures,' since these were unusual terms  compared to 'business as usual,' and misleading, as they seemed to  exclude consideration of policies and measures implemented prior  to the starting point of the projection. On financial resources,  issues raised included whether to provide details of measures or  detailed information of the activities undertaken to implement  Annex I commitments and how to format the reports.

On Saturday, 30 October, the joint contact group concluded its  work and agreed to forward the Chair's draft conclusions  containing a draft decision on Part II of the guidelines on  national communications to the SBSTA.

SBSTA considered the draft conclusions on Monday, 1 November, and  amended a paragraph calling on Parties to report on significant  technology transfer success stories, to also include reference to  failures. On the same day, SBI agreed to recommend the draft  decision for adoption by COP-5.

COP-5 adopted the draft decision on Part II of the guidelines  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.3) and the addendum containing the guidelines  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.3/Add.1) on Thursday, 4 November. In the decision,  the COP, inter alia: decides that Part II of the guidelines should  be used for the preparation of third national communications;  requests Annex I Parties to provide a detailed report on their  activities in relation to systematic observation; and urges Annex  II Parties to assist Parties with economies in transition (EITs)  with technical aspects in preparing national communications.

The COP also adopted the draft decision recommended by SB-10, on  Part I (annual inventories) of the FCCC guidelines for the  preparation of national communications by Annex I Parties  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.2) together with an addendum containing the  guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/6/Add.1). In the decision, the COP,  inter alia: decides that Part I of the guidelines should be used  beginning in the year 2000; and decides that these guidelines  shall be considered by SBSTA-15 with a view to a decision for  consideration by COP-7.

Guidelines for the Technical Reviews of GHG Inventories: The SBI  considered this sub-item on Monday, 25 October, and agreed that it  should be considered by the joint contact group on national  communications from Annex I Parties. On Wednesday, 27 October, the  joint contact group decided to refer consideration of the  technical review guidelines to a smaller group.

On Saturday, 30 October, the joint contact group considered and  adopted the SBI draft conclusions on these guidelines, including a  draft decision to which the guidelines are annexed. On Thursday, 4  November, the COP adopted the draft decision recommended by SBI  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.11) and the addendum containing the guidelines  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.11/Add.1) after CHINA amended the text to state  that the purpose of the technical review is to assist 'Annex I  Parties' instead of 'all Parties' in gaining experience relevant  to the preparation of guidelines related to Protocol Articles 5  (methodology), 7 (communication) and 8 (review of information).  The objective of these guidelines is, inter alia, to promote  consistency in the review of annual GHG inventories of Annex I  Parties and to establish a process for a thorough and  comprehensive technical assessment of inventories.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

On Monday, 25 October, SBI considered  non-Annex I communications. A contact group, chaired by Mohamed  Mahmoud Ould el Ghaouth (Mauritania), met several times from 26  October - 1 November. The COP considered and adopted the draft  conclusions recommended by SBI on Thursday, 4 November.

On obstacles to producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA called for provision of adequate financial resources,  technical assistance and capacity building to support non-Annex I  Parties in collecting data and identifying national emissions  factors and methodologies for adaptation assessment. The EU,  opposed by CHINA, said the Global Environment Facility (GEF) had  provided most non-Annex I Parties with funding for national  communications. UZBEKISTAN noted that constraints included lack of  research and data on emissions factors. IRAN noted that countries  have needs determined by their unique circumstances.

On the advantages of producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA said that despite difficulties in identifying significant  trends, the synthesis of initial non-Annex I communications was a  first step in considering information related to FCCC  implementation by non-Annex I Parties. The EU, CANADA and  MICRONESIA noted the usefulness of the compilation and synthesis  report in better understanding the difficulties faced by non-Annex  I Parties.

The G-77/CHINA opposed changing the guidelines for non-Annex I  communications, as many non-Annex I countries have not finalized  their first communications. AOSIS noted the need to modify IPCC  guidelines for small island developing States (SIDS) because they  are not always applicable to their special circumstances. Since  many countries had expressed an interest in initiating second  national communications, the EU said guidelines should be  reviewed. SWITZERLAND said there is a need for one unified  reporting format for all FCCC Parties and for the use of IPCC  guidelines.

The G-77/CHINA called for the involvement of non-Annex I Party  experts in preparing non-Annex I communications. The EU and others  highlighted the need for expert review and consideration of non- Annex I communications. AOSIS opposed technical assessment  processes for individual national communications. The REPUBLIC OF  KOREA added that expert review teams should focus on identifying  solutions to obstacles in preparing communications.

On the timing of second national communications, the G-77/ CHINA  noted that there is a differentiated timetable under the FCCC for  submission of national communications by Annex I and non-Annex I  Parties. She said submissions of non-Annex I Parties'  communications were contingent on the availability of financial  resources. The US, supported by CANADA and SWITZERLAND and opposed  by CHINA, said the revision of guidelines was fundamental to  improving second national communications.

On Tuesday, 26 October, the contact group discussed proposals  submitted by the EU and the G-77/China. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by  the EU and others, said its proposal should serve as the basis for  the group's discussions. Some delegates proposed identification of  common elements between the two proposals. The G-77/CHINA,  supported by others, drew attention to contentious elements,  including technical assessments of non-Annex I communications  contained in the EU proposal. She questioned the purpose, nature  and usefulness of these assessments. The EU and others said the  purpose of technical assessments is to improve non-Annex I  communications. The group agreed to work on a Co-Chairs'  compilation text.

On Monday, 1 November, SBI considered and adopted the draft  recommendations on matters related to consideration of non-Annex I  communications, which includes the terms of reference of the  consultative group of experts (CGE) on non-Annex I national  communications. INDIA and CHINA proposed deletion of a paragraph  that calls on the CGE to consider steps taken or envisaged by the  Party to implement the FCCC. The recommendations were adopted  without amendment. Delegates also adopted the Chair's draft  conclusions on the provision of financial and technical support  for non-Annex I national communications.

COP-5 adopted the decision on other matters related to non-Annex I  communications (FCCC/CP/1999/L.10/Add.1/Rev.1) on Thursday, 4  November. The decision states, inter alia:*  the consideration of non-Annex I communications shall be  carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of decision  12/CP.4 (non-Annex I communications); *  the guidelines for the preparation of initial non-Annex I  communications contained in decision 10/CP.2 (non-Annex I  communications), together with guidance provided to the GEF, shall  continue to be valid for all initial communications; and *  the COP agrees to begin a process of reviewing the guidelines  for the preparation of national communications with the aim of  improving them by COP-7.

The COP also decides to:*  establish a CGE on non-Annex I communications with the  objective of improving these communications, as set out in an  annex; *  reconsider at COP-7 the terms of reference of the CGE; and *  request the FCCC Secretariat to facilitate the work of the  consultative group.

The CGE terms of reference attached to the decision state that,  inter alia: the CGE will have the aim to improve the preparation  process of non-Annex I communications; the CGE will be composed of  experts, five of whom will be drawn from Africa, five from Asia,  five from Latin America and the Caribbean, and six from Annex I  Parties; and up to three experts from organizations with relevant  experience will be selected by the Secretariat. The group is  mandated to, inter alia: exchange experiences and information on  the preparation of non-Annex I communications; identify non-Annex  I Parties' technical and financial needs and the difficulties they  face; and facilitate and support the preparation of their national  communications.

The COP also adopted a draft decision on the first compilation and  synthesis of initial communications from non-Annex I Parties  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.10) forwarded by SBI-10. This decision requests:  non-Annex I Parties which have not submitted their initial  communications within three years of entry into force of the FCCC,  to do so as soon as possible; the Secretariat to prepare the  second compilation and synthesis of initial non-Annex I  communications, and to make that report available to SB-14 with a  view to its consideration by COP-6; and the Secretariat to report  on problems encountered in using the guidelines for the  preparation of initial communications by non-Annex I Parties with  a view to enhancing further their comparability and focus. The  decision also concludes that, inter alia, non-Annex I Parties are  fulfilling their commitments under FCCC Article 4.1(a) (comparable  methodologies) and following the FCCC guidelines. It points to the  need to maintain and enhance national capacity in non-Annex I  Parties in order to prepare initial communications.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This agenda item was considered in a joint  SBI/SBSTA session on 26 October and in a contact group that met  four times from 27-30 October. The contact group considered the  Co-Chairs' proposal for a draft decision on capacity building that  was based on a G-77/China proposal and incorporated submissions  from the EU and other Annex I Parties.

Many delegates welcomed the G-77/CHINA proposal for a draft  decision on capacity building (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/MISC.9) for  developing countries, which contains a list of developing country  needs, as a basis for adopting a decision at COP-5. The G-77/China  draft decision called on the COP to, inter alia: conduct capacity  building activities in and for developing countries; provide the  necessary financial and technical support to strengthen national  focal points; promote climate-related research and studies; and  promote capacity building of national institutions and expertise.  It further requests the Secretariat to, inter alia, prepare a plan  to facilitate capacity building for developing countries. It  underscored the importance of workshops being undertaken with the  participation of developing countries.

In discussing the G-77/China proposal, delegates highlighted,  inter alia: the inclusion of EITs in capacity-building activities  (EU, KAZAKHSTAN); that capacity building be 'for,' 'by' and 'in'  developing countries (the PHILIPPINES); the need for a coordinated  response among existing efforts in capacity building (CANADA); the  lack of utility in holding short workshops, as developing  countries need continuous ones (CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC); and the  identification of non-Annex I Parties' needs by analyzing their  national communications (EU). AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and  UZBEKISTAN said that capacity building was necessary to take full  advantage of the CDM.

Regarding the process of capacity building, a number of developing  countries said it should be country driven rather than agency  driven and must follow the guidance of the COP.

The meeting decided to continue the deliberations in a contact  group co-chaired by SBI Chair John Ashe and Dan Reifsnyder (US).  The contact group discussed whether: to use the draft as a basis  for negotiation; if EITs should be included in the draft decision;  and whether capacity building is a prerequisite for meaningful  developing country participation.

On Wednesday 3 November, the joint SBI/SBSTA agreed to recommend  COP-5 to adopt the Co-Chairs' two proposals for draft decisions on  capacity building for developing countries and for EITs. The  MARSHALL ISLANDS expressed its reservation on the request to the  Secretariat to coordinate with bilateral and multilateral  institutions in preparing the elements of a draft framework for  capacity building activities, since this would be a top-down  approach. The COP adopted these draft decisions on 4 November.

The decision for capacity building in developing countries  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.19), inter alia: recognizes the constraints in  developing countries to implementing the Convention and, in  particular, the special capacity-building needs of the least  developed countries (LDCs) and SIDS; emphasizes that capacity  building is a continuous process; and states that capacity  building for developing countries must be country-driven,  reflecting national initiatives and priorities. COP-5 decided  that: financial and technical support for capacity building in  developing countries should be provided through the financial  mechanism and bilateral and multilateral agencies; existing  capacity building activities and programmes should be  comprehensively assessed to determine their effectiveness and  identify gaps and weaknesses in ongoing efforts; and developing  countries' special needs should be further elaborated. The  decision outlines issues to be considered in the assessment,  including ways and means for capacity building to strengthen FCCC  national focal points, build expertise and strengthen  institutions, and conduct training, seminars and exchange  programmes for the personnel of developing country institutions.

The decision on capacity building for EITs (FCCC/CP/1999/L.20)  states that, inter alia: financial and technical support for  capacity building in EITs should be provided through bilateral and  multilateral channels and the private sector; existing programmes  and activities should be comprehensively assessed to determine  their effectiveness and identify gaps and weaknesses; and the  special needs of EITs should be elaborated.

Both decisions further invite concerned Parties to identify their  needs and priorities for capacity building, and request the  Secretariat to compile and synthesize the information and, based  on the information and in consultation with the Parties, develop a  draft framework for capacity-building activities.

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Consultative Process:  This agenda item was considered by SBSTA on Wednesday, 27 October.  Delegates expressed appreciation of the African regional workshop  organized as part of the consultative process to advance the  understanding of technology transfer under the Convention.

Bert Metz, IPCC Working Group III Co-Chair, outlined the special  report on technology transfer, which stresses that effective  transfer of environmentally-sound technologies (ESTs) requires an  integrated approach based on networking among stakeholders within  a sustainable development framework. He said actions to enhance  technology transfer are specific to sectors, national  circumstances and stakeholders.

Several Parties said technology transfer should be driven by the  private sector. AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU highlighted the  potential role of the CDM in technology transfer. The PHILIPPINES,  with SAUDI ARABIA and CHINA, stressed that technology transfer was  a commitment under the FCCC and opposed linking it to the CDM.  CHINA said technology transfer under the Protocol should be  additional to that under the FCCC. The PHILIPPINES called for  information on technology transfer activities in Annex I  communications. AOSIS stressed addressing adaptation technologies.  SWITZERLAND underscored consideration of specific national  circumstances.

The COP adopted SBSTA's draft conclusions and a decision  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.5) on Thursday, 4 November. The COP decided to,  inter alia, extend the consultative process until COP-6 and invite  non-Annex I Parties to report on their technology needs in their  national communications. It also called on Annex II Parties to  report on technology transfer activities.

Ways and Means of Limiting Hydrofluorocarbons and  Perfluorocarbons: On Thursday, 28 October, delegates considered  the report on the meeting of the IPCC and the Montreal Protocol's  Technical and Economic Assessment Panel on ways and means of  limiting hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).  The meeting highlighted, inter alia: the complexity of links  between ozone depletion and climate change mitigation activities;  the multiplicity of solutions required to address these global  change issues; and the desirability of solutions tailored to  regional or national needs.

GREENPEACE called for action to avoid dumping potentially harmful  technologies in developing countries. ARGENTINA and others called  for attention to the medical use of HFCs in metered dose inhalers.

Following informal consultations conducted by Andrej Kranjc  (Slovenia), COP-5 adopted a decision on the relationship between  efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone layer and efforts to  safeguard the global climate system on Thursday, 4 November. In  this decision (FCCC/CP/1999/L.6), the COP: invites each Party to  give consideration to the information available on the ways and  means of limiting emissions of HFCs and PFCs taking into account,  inter alia, health, medical, environmental and safety  considerations, energy efficiency and associate emissions in CO2  equivalent and technical and economic considerations; requests the  IPCC to take into account this information in the TAR; and  requests SBSTA to further consider aspects of this issue at its  first session following COP-6.

Coastal Adaptation Technologies: On Thursday, 28 October, SBSTA  considered the technical paper on coastal adaptation technologies  and submissions by Parties regarding options to accelerate and  sustain the development and transfer of coastal adaptation  technologies. AOSIS stressed SIDS' vulnerability and underscored  the need to develop long-term approaches to adaptation in the  Convention's context. He noted that financial and human resources  limitations have stifled progress in adaptation and highlighted  the potential of the CDM in this regard.

COP-5 endorsed the SBSTA conclusions (FCCC/1999/SBSTA/L.21),  which: note the need to develop endogenous capacities,  technologies and know-how to enable Parties to evaluate and  implement appropriate adaptation strategies; recognize that such  technologies are important to countries vulnerable to sea-level  rise; and state that further work on such technologies, including  their transfer, should be considered as part of the transfer of  technology consultative process.

Other Matters Relating to Development and Transfer of Technology:  On Thursday, 28 October, the FCCC Secretariat reported to SBSTA on  its cooperative activities aimed at improving the climate data  from reporting systems. In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.18),  SBSTA called on the Secretariat to continue its collaboration with  the OECD's Development Assistance Committee to provide  comprehensive data.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

On Tuesday, 26 October, a joint SBI/SBSTA session  considered matters related to FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and  Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects).

Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) reported on a workshop on  implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 held from 21-24  September 1999 in Bonn. Many delegates said the workshop was a  useful exercise. The G-77/CHINA said it had highlighted the need  for another workshop prior to COP-6.

Regarding information gaps on adverse effects, the MARSHALL  ISLANDS called for more robust research on policies and measures  in Annex I countries. AUSTRALIA, with CANADA and the GAMBIA, said  the absence of information on the effect of policies and measures  should not be an obstacle to meeting the needs of the truly  vulnerable. SENEGAL called for evaluation of vulnerability in  Africa by COP-6.

On the impact of response measures on the economies of oil  producing and other countries, SAUDI ARABIA referred to recent  studies suggesting oil producing countries will suffer  economically from response measures and, with KUWAIT and LIBYA,  said developed countries should remove market distortions in the  energy sector. The US said there was uncertainty over the impact  of implementation of response measures. JAPAN and the MARSHALL  ISLANDS said consideration of compensation was unacceptable, since  it is not provided for in the FCCC or the Protocol. A contact  group co-chaired by Bo KjÃ©llen (Sweden) and Mohammad Reza Salamat  (Iran) was convened on this issue. The group met several times  from 27 October to 4 November.

Co-Chair Salamat presented the Co-Chairs' draft decision on  Saturday, 30 October, and on Tuesday, 2 November, the group  considered the draft text. Divergence of views focused on: whether  to 'establish' or 'continue' a process for the further  implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9; what the process was  about; whether it should be assessed by the Parties 'annually,'  'periodically,' 'on a 'regular basis' or 'by COP-6 and subsequent  COPs, as appropriate;' whether there should be one or two  workshops in 2000; and what topics the workshop[s] should address.  A proposal requesting Annex I Parties to report on initial actions  undertaken to implement FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 was discussed.  Some delegates considered that non-Annex I Parties should also be  requested to report on these actions.

The COP adopted the a draft decision on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9  and Protocol Article 3.14 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.22) on Thursday, 4  November. The decision recognizes that the identification of  initial actions necessary to address the adverse effects of  climate change and/or the impact of the implementation of response  measures needs to be based on sufficient information and analysis  within a clearly defined process. The COP decided that the process  of implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9, as established by  decisions 3/CP.3 and 5/CP.4, should, inter alia, continue and  gather information on initial actions needed to address the  specific needs and concerns of developing countries and LDCs  arising from climate change and/or the impact of the  implementation of response measures, as well as identify what  actions are necessary under the Convention relating to funding,  insurance and transfer of technology to meet the specific needs  and concerns of developing countries and LDCs. It further decides  that SB-12 shall continue consideration of the implementation of  FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9, including consideration of the extent  of developing countries' efforts to diversify their national  economies and of how the international community could best  support such efforts. The COP decided to organize two workshops  under the guidance of the SB Chairs: one on the consideration of  initial actions needed to meet developing countries' and LDCs'  specific needs and concerns arising from the adverse effects of  climate change; and another workshop on the methodological  approaches and actions that are necessary to address the impact of  the implementation of response measures on, inter alia, terms of  trade, international capital flows and development efforts. The  two workshops shall be organized in two consecutive but equal time  periods, before 31 March 2000.

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY (AIJ)

Delegates discussed issues  related to AIJ under the pilot phase, first in a joint SBI/SBSTA  session and later in five sessions of a joint SBSTA/SBI contact  group chaired by Yvo de Boer (Netherlands). Delegates considered  draft decisions submitted by the Chair, the EU and the G-77/China.

In the joint SBI/SBSTA session on Tuesday, 26 October, the G-77/CHINA underlined the imbalance of the geographical distribution  of pilot projects and urged extension of the pilot phase. JAPAN,  supported by the EU, said the experience gained is sufficient for  a comprehensive review. With POLAND, he stressed that an AIJ  project should be eligible under JI or the CDM if it meets the  criteria for eligibility and if the Parties involved agree to do  so. The US proposed exploring the eligibility of AIJ projects  under the CDM or JI. AOSIS and others opposed linking AIJ to the  Protocol mechanisms. BOTSWANA said introducing crediting would  confuse the process. The EU and SWITZERLAND, opposed by AOSIS,  BOTSWANA and IRAN, proposed that AIJ be credited retroactively.  AOSIS drew attention to the inaccuracies, under-reporting and  procedural complications that make it inappropriate to credit  retroactively. The US identified the lack of crediting and  capacity in the host countries and high transaction costs for  small projects as barriers in the pilot phase. SWITZERLAND and  AUSTRALIA said that without credit, industries would be cautious  about AIJ. IRAN noted the absence of criteria for assessing and  elaborating the benefits of AIJ projects and said these were  subject to different interpretations. He called for a continuation  of the pilot phase without preconditions or credits. The REPUBLIC  OF KOREA said that since most AIJ projects are financed through  official funds like ODA and the GEF, credit certification should  be treated carefully. The AFRICAN GROUP underscored the need to  involve local communities in the design and execution of such  projects.

Discussion in the contact group centered on, inter alia, whether:  to continue the review beyond this session; to continue the pilot  phase and, if so, in what form; the group should take decisions or  make recommendations about the eligibility of AIJ to become CDM or  JI; and the issue of eligibility should be discussed by the  contact group on mechanisms.

On Friday, 29 October, Chair de Boer presented a proposal for a  draft decision on AIJ that he said took into account the  differences of opinion expressed. The EU also introduced its draft  proposal that sought to stop the non-credited pilot phase and  start an AIJ phase with possible crediting, subject to decision- making in the negotiation on the mechanisms. On Saturday, 30  October, the G-77/CHINA tabled its proposed draft decision whereby  the COP decides to conclude the review process and take a  conclusive decision on the pilot phase and the progression beyond  that at COP-6. This draft decision included bracketed text on the  eligibility of AIJ under CDM and JI. After lengthy deliberations  both in the contact group and in informal consultations, Parties  agreed to a decision that the COP adopted on Thursday, 4 November.  The decision (FCCC/CP/1999/L.13), inter alia: concludes the review  process; continues the AIJ pilot phase beyond the end of the  present decade, without prejudice to future decisions; and  requires Parties to provide proposals to improve the draft revised  uniform reporting format, and the Secretariat to prepare a draft  revision for SB-13.

### OTHER MATTERS

Research and Systematic Observation: SBSTA  considered research and systematic observation on 27-28 October.  The Global Climate Observation System (GCOS) reported on progress  in enhancing global observatory systems and noted that  deficiencies are a result of inadequate equipment, poor  infrastructure and insufficient funding. The GEF pledged  additional funds to build observational capacity for certain  developing countries. Following subsequent informal consultations  conducted by Susan Barrell (Australia), and SBSTA consideration,  the COP adopted a draft decision (FCCC/CP/1999/L.4) on Thursday, 4  November. The decision, inter alia: recognizes the need to  identify priority capacity-building needs relating to  participation in systematic observation; invites the GCOS  Secretariat, in consultation with relevant bodies, to organize  regional workshops; invites the GCOS Secretariat to continue to  assist in establishing an intergovernmental process to identify  priorities for action to improve global observing systems, and to  report back at SBSTA-12; adopts the FCCC reporting guidelines on  global climate observing systems; and invites Parties to report on  systematic observation in accordance with these guidelines, in  conjunction with national communications for Annex I Parties, and  on a voluntary basis for non-Annex I Parties. COP-5 also adopted  the addendum containing the guidelines (FCCC/CP/1999/L.4/Add.1).

Proposal by Brazil: On Wednesday, 27 October, SBSTA considered the  scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal from Brazil,  which attempts to allocate responsibilities among different GHG  emitters based on their actions as measured by the increase in  global temperatures, rather than by emissions. Several delegates  supported the concept of differentiated responsibilities, while a  number noted that further scientific analysis would be useful. The  EU and PERU, opposed by MALAYSIA, said the issue should be  considered as part of IPCC's TAR. Following informal  consultations, SBSTA adopted draft conclusions on this matter, and  on Thursday, 4 November, COP-5 took note of the draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.13/Rev.1). The conclusions state that SBSTA,  inter alia, takes note of a revised version of the proposal by  Brazil and decides to consider any new information on this issue  at subsequent sessions, as appropriate.

Cooperation with the IPCC: Following consideration by SBSTA,  during which delegates debated the GEF's funding role in relation  to the IPCC, the COP adopted a draft decision on cooperation with  the IPCC (FCCC/CP/1999/L.18) on Thursday, 4 November. The  decision: expresses the COP's appreciation to the IPCC for its  high quality work; notes with concern the IPCC's urgent appeal for  additional resources; urges Parties and other organizations to  contribute financial support to enable the IPCC to complete its  TAR and special reports; and invites SBI-12 to consider the matter  of support for the IPCC, in the context of recommending additional  guidance to the GEF.

Emissions from International Transportation: On Thursday, 4  November, COP-5 adopted a draft decision on emissions based on  fuel sold to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.17). The decision emerged following discussions in  SBSTA and extensive informal consultations conducted over several  days by JosÃ© Romero (Switzerland). The final decision, inter alia,  expresses its appreciation for and welcomes the Special Report on  Aviation and the Global Atmosphere and requests the SBSTA to  continue its work on methodological issues relevant to this  matter.

# PROPOSALS TO AMEND THE LISTS IN ANNEXES I AND II TO THE CONVENTION

COP-5 considered proposals to amend FCCC Annex I and II relating  to Turkey and Kazakhstan. Delegates to COP-5 first considered the  proposal by Pakistan and Azerbaijan to delete the name of Turkey  from Annexes I and II of the FCCC in Plenary on Wednesday, 27  October. The US, MEXICO and GEORGIA supported the proposal. The  MARSHALL ISLANDS expressed concern about the precedent it would  set. On Friday, 1 November, President Szyszko announced to the COP  that, in spite of informal consultations undertaken during  previous days, Parties' positions had not changed and consensus  remained elusive. The COP decided to defer consideration of this  matter to COP-6.

Delegates also considered a proposal from Kazakhstan to be  included in the list in FCCC Annex I. Several Annex I Parties  welcomed the proposal, while several non-Annex I Parties said  further information was needed on Kazakhstan's ability to fulfill  Annex I commitments. In spite of informal consultations on the  proposal, consensus was not achieved, and on its final day, the  COP requested COP-6 to take up the matter.

# PREPARATIONS FOR THE FIRST SESSION OF THE CONFERENCE OF THE  PARTIES SERVING AS THE MEETING OF THE PARTIES TO THE KYOTO  PROTOCOL (COP/MOP-1)

On Thursday, 4 November, delegates adopted in Plenary a decision  proposed by President Szyszko on implementation of the BAPA  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.14), based on the views expressed during the high- level segment. Szyszko said this decision reflected the will of  the COP to engage in intensified negotiations in order to  implement the BAPA. SAUDI ARABIA said he could not accept  negotiations taking place outside the FCCC bodies and opposed the  appointment of facilitators.

The decision: requests the subsidiary bodies to intensify the  preparatory work required to enable it to take decisions at COP-6  on issues included in the BAPA; requests the President, with the  Bureau's assistance, to provide guidance to the subsidiary bodies,  take all necessary steps to intensify the negotiating process on  all issues, and recommend an effective organization of the work of  COP-6; and invites all Parties to contribute substantially and, as  appropriate, financially, to the preparatory work, including  supporting adequate participation of developing countries,  particularly LDCs and SIDS.

### LULUCF

On Monday, 25 October, SBSTA initiated consideration of  land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). IPCC Chair Robert  Watson presented provisional findings from the Special Report on  LULUCF. He said key decisions should be made with respect to  definitions, the accounting system, monitoring and reporting  systems and inventory guidelines, before the Protocol could be  implemented. The G-77/CHINA said any consideration of the LULUCF  process should begin after the release of the IPCC Special Report.  AUSTRALIA stressed that the key question is not 'whether' but  'how' additional sink activities could be included in the  Protocol. CANADA said the decision-making framework should be  based on consistency between the provisions of the Protocol.

Regarding additional activities, the US said there should be  transparency in reporting and verifiability. The EU said the IPCC  Special Report and country specific data should provide the basis  for future discussions and decisions.

A contact group, co-chaired by Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland) and  Philip Gwage (Uganda), was convened to consider LULUCF-related  issues. The group met several times between 27 October and 1  November. Differing views were expressed on, inter alia: the  sequence of activities in the lead-up to SBSTA-12 and how they  inter-relate; presentation and transmission of the IPCC Special  Report to SBSTA-12; timing for submissions and consideration of  criteria and guiding principles for data on additional activities;  timing for submissions and proposals for definitions on activities  under Article 3.3; and timing for and types of country-specific  data. The group decided to base its discussions on draft  conclusions that contained a work programme proposed by the G-77/CHINA. The group read through the text and established a  drafting group to work on it.

On Monday, 1 November, the contact group agreed on the draft  conclusions, which were then adopted by SBSTA on Wednesday, 3  November 1999. The COP adopted the draft decision  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.16) on Thursday, 4 November, endorsing a work  programme and elements of a decision-making framework to address  LULUCF with a view to COP-6 recommending that COP/MOP-1 adopt  draft decisions on Protocol Articles 3.3 (net changes in emissions  and removals) and 3.4 (additional human-induced activities  relating to changes in emissions and removals).

The work programme calls for, inter alia:*  consideration of the IPCC Special Report on LULUCF at SBSTA-12,  with an in-depth report at that session; *  the convening of a special side event on the IPCC Special  Report; *  further consideration of the initial criteria and guiding  principles for the identification and selection of activities  under Protocol Article 3.4; *  submissions from Parties by 1 August 2000 with views or  proposals for definitions, on activities under Protocol Article  3.3, for consideration by SBSTA-13; *  submissions from Parties on the methodologies that they intend  to use to measure and report on net changes in GHGs resulting from  these activities, measured as verifiable changes in carbon stocks,  resulting from activities under Protocol Article 3.3; *  submissions by Annex I Parties of preliminary data and  information as specified in the first sentence of Article  3.4;  and *  submissions by Parties as to how and which human-induced  activities will be included under Protocol Article 3.4, on  modalities, rules and guidelines related to these activities for  consideration by SBSTA-13.

Submissions by Annex I Parties on Article 3.4 should include a  list of additional activities that each individual Party is  proposing for inclusion and national data and an assessment of  changes in GHG emissions and removals, associated with each  activity each Party is proposing to include.

### MECHANISMS

Delegates discussed issues related to the Protocol  mechanisms initially in a joint SBI/SBSTA session and later in a  contact group chaired by Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia), which met six  times. Discussions centered on the revised synthesis of proposals  by Parties on principles, modalities, rules and guidelines on the  protocol mechanisms (FCCC/SB/1999/8 and Add.1).

In a joint SBI/SBSTA session on Tuesday, 26 October, Chair Chow  introduced the revised synthesis of proposals by Parties on  principles, modalities, rules and guidelines on Protocol  mechanisms and noted that they could form the basis for a draft  negotiating text. UZBEKISTAN, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, sought  clear definitions of core concepts. The G-77/CHINA said a CDM  decision must precede decisions on other mechanisms. The US  supported parallel progress on the mechanisms with priority given  to the CDM.  CHINA opposed taking a single decision on all  mechanisms since this was not supported by the Protocol. He  recommended that there be three distinct decisions. SAUDI ARABIA  stressed that progress on this issue is conditional on progress on  other equally important issues. AOSIS highlighted the need for the  mechanisms to be based on sound environmental principles. He added  that AOSIS would not permit mechanisms that allow Annex I Parties  to offload domestic responsibilities.

The EU said a ceiling on the use of mechanisms has to be defined.  With NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, he suggested refining the synthesis  into a draft negotiating text. The joint SBI-SBSTA session charged  the contact group with the task of revising and consolidating  Parties' views into a draft negotiating text and agreeing on a  work plan in the lead-up to COP-6.

###     Work Plan up to COP-6:

On a possible work plan up to COP-6, the EU  and the US sought intensification of the process, in particular  through technical workshops. CHINA, INDONESIA and IRAN highlighted  the need to convene intersessional meetings to strengthen  intergovernmental work. JAPAN and CANADA said both technical  workshops and intersessional meetings should be held prior to COP- 6. The G-77/CHINA and others highlighted the need for transparency  in the process and adequate developing country expert  participation in the technical workshops. SUDAN said Parties  needed time to review the information and findings of technical  workshops.

On working towards a draft negotiating text, the G-77/CHINA said  this was premature, since Parties were still at the stage of  making submissions, noting convergence/divergence and synthesizing  views. He defined a draft negotiating text as 'the penultimate  stage in the text that the COP will finally adopt.' JAPAN, the US  and AUSTRALIA defined it as a living document that would go  through several drafts. Chair Chow noted that the text would be a  living document synthesizing the views of all Parties to  facilitate the negotiating process.

###     Clean Development Mechanism:

On the project cycle of the CDM, the  G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the CDM's driving force,  nature and scope. Several Parties agreed that the host country is  the best judge of its sustainable development needs. SOUTH AFRICA,  the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA proposed including in  the CDM the concept of emissions avoidance. BOLIVIA proposed  including forest protection initiatives under emissions avoidance.  MEXICO said he looked forward to using the CDM to supplement  national efforts to shift from slash-and-burn techniques, which  are responsible for loss of forest cover, to sustainable  technologies that would have a positive impact on climate change.  MAURITANIA objected to the inclusion of forest protection within  the CDM, as Parties would seek to protect their forests regardless  of its inclusion. IRAN said the CDM should include projects  related to both sinks and sources. On the issue of baselines for  emissions avoidance projects, NEW ZEALAND suggested that, to  minimize transaction costs, the commercial contract-bidding  process should be used to identify the baseline. The EU said the  baselines should be determined on a project-by-project basis.  MOROCCO stressed the need to certify that reduced or avoided  emissions are real, measurable and contribute to sustainable  development in the host country. With SWITZERLAND, she said CDM  projects should be subjected to rigorous impact assessment studies  that take into account the socio-economic aspects of the host  country.

On the financing of CDM projects, Chair Chow queried whether the  funding will be bilateral, multilateral or unilateral; if ODA and  the FCCC's financial mechanisms could fund CDM activities; or if  CDM funds will be managed by the Executive Board, so as to ensure  equitable distribution. JAPAN asked whether unilaterally-funded  projects were consistent with the concept of CDM. The REPUBLIC OF  KOREA said unilateral funding for CDM would provide incentives for  non-Annex I Parties to implement measures to reduce GHGs. COLOMBIA  said that as long as CDM projects demonstrate additionality and  lead to real and measurable long-term reductions, there should be  flexibility in financing the projects. Regarding the use of ODA  and GEF funds, the G-77/CHINA emphasized that CDM funding should  be additional to ODA and other financial commitments. JAPAN said  there were no provisions requiring financial additionality and  none that preclude the use of ODA as a source of funding. He said  the CDM should be mainly funded by the private sector.

On CDM project monitoring, MAURITANIA said monitoring and  reporting should not burden the host country. BOLIVIA suggested  that Parties monitor their own projects and 'learn by doing.'  NORWAY and AUSTRALIA said that project participants, the host  Party or a designated legal entity should monitor. The EU said  operational entities should perform certification and  verification, which is dependent on monitoring.

###     Joint Implementation:

On JI, Chair Chow asked whether the host  country or an independent entity should validate the project  proposal. JAPAN responded that each Party should decide on its own  and added that creating unnecessary bureaucracies would discourage  Annex I Parties from entering into JI. On project verification,  NEW ZEALAND suggested that individual Parties determine the level  of verification that they desire, as the countries involved in JI  have both a target and an incentive for ensuring the credibility  of projects. He added that under JI the question of additionality  is different from the CDM, as the Party would have to give up or  cancel some of its assigned amount. CANADA, with the US, noted  that the review of additionality for JI projects would be under  Article 8 (review of information). The EU questioned how  additionality could be ensured if Parties did not comply with  Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues) and 7 (communication  of information).

### Emissions Trading:

On the project cycle of emissions trading,  AOSIS sought the establishment of a common set of principles  across all the mechanisms, including the principles of  environmental integrity and additionality. The US said the  integrity of the emissions trading system would be founded on  monitoring and reporting under Protocol Articles 5 and 7 and the  existence of registries. The G-77/CHINA said the nature and scope  of emissions trading must be determined before operational details  are worked out. He added that the postulate 'you cannot sell what  you do not own' should circumscribe the nature and scope of  emissions trading. The US and others noted the need to develop  cost-effective mechanisms. The EU stressed the need for the  mechanisms to be underwritten by strong monitoring and reporting  requirements. SWITZERLAND suggested a 'post-verification model'  wherein emission reduction units could not be transferred until  they have been certified to be excess Assigned Amount Units  (AAUs).

On fungibility, the US said Protocol Articles 3.10, 3.11 and 3.12  (QELROs) explain how AAUs, Certified Emission Reductions (CERs)  and Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) can be transferred from Party  to Party. The G-77/CHINA said that while AAUs derive from past  emissions and are retrospective, CERs derive from the future and  are prospective. FRANCE said while trading in CERs is safe,  trading in AAUs could be unsafe if the country transferring them  ran into compliance trouble at the end of its budget period.  Noting that CDM focuses on sustainable development, SRI LANKA said  its objective is different from that of the other mechanisms.  AOSIS added that this could lead to a difference in value between  the CERs and AAUs. He underscored the need to consider whether  there would be a discount to neutralize the disadvantage to the  CDM if fungibility is accepted.

On liability, NEW ZEALAND highlighted the need to consider cost  effectiveness and the objectives of the FCCC. He said that  liability rules would increase costs and therefore reduce funding  available to meet FCCC objectives.

On bookkeeping, delegates discussed whether there should be single  centralized registry for all three mechanisms or a separate  registry for each of the mechanisms. SRI LANKA highlighted the  differences between the mechanisms and suggested that there be  different registries. CANADA said it was open to the notion of a  core set of guidelines for the creation of national registries,  noting that one central registry could be problematic. The EU  added that national registries are critical to the system and  inquired about the need to link the national system to the  international one.

###     Decision on Mechanisms:

On Wednesday, November 4, the COP adopted  a decision, recommended by SBI/SBSTA, on mechanisms pursuant to  Articles 6,12 and 17 of the Protocol (FCCC/CP/1999/L.15). The  decision requests the SBI/SBSTA Chairs to, inter alia, revise the  synthesis of Parties' proposals based on further submissions,  consolidate the text, and take it forward, prior to COP-6, as a  basis for further negotiations. It also requests the Chairs to  convene intersessional meetings and workshops in preparation for  COP-6.

### COMPLIANCE

The joint SBI/SBSTA considered procedures and  mechanisms on compliance under the Protocol on Tuesday, 26  October. Espen RÃ¸nneberg (Marshall Islands), Co-Chair of the Joint  Working Group on compliance (JWG) with Harald Dovland (Norway),  reported on the informal exchange of views on compliance held in  Vienna from 6-7 October 1999.

The JWG met five times between Tuesday, 26 October, and Wednesday,  3 November. Delegates heard five diagrammatic submissions  illustrating a compliance system. The US said its design for the  compliance system is focused on Protocol Article 3 (GHG reduction  and limitation commitments) and provides for both facilitative and  enforcement functions. She said the goal of enforcement is to  ensure compliance through binding consequences that are known in  advance. In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a  single compliance body and outlined steps ranging from  technical/financial assistance to a series of recommendations such  as strengthening of reporting requirements. These are to be  exhausted before the entry into force of consequences. The EU  explained that its compliance committee would have a facilitative  branch and an enforcement branch, with a possible referral from  the former to the latter. Issues would be channeled automatically  to the branches.

SAMOA stressed two features of the AOSIS diagram: avoidance of  polarization between the facilitative and enforcement functions,  since they overlap, and an eligibility committee responsible for  the determination of mechanism eligibility. He added that an ad  hoc appeal body would hear quasi-judicial appeals on the  imposition of binding penalties. AUSTRALIA said its compliance  procedure focused on Protocol Article 3. She highlighted that  facilitation would be available on any issue relating to the  target and that the outcome of the compliance procedure would be a  COP/ MOP decision applying the negative consensus rule.

On the design of a compliance system, a number of delegates  underlined that it should promote compliance, prevent non- compliance as well as address cases of non-compliance. A number of  developing countries, opposed by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, CANADA  and the US, said the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities should apply.

Regarding coverage, delegates differed on whether the system  should address compliance with all the Protocol commitments or  focus on compliance with Protocol Article 3 (QELROs). They also  discussed whether compliance with the mechanisms' provisions  should be addressed under a separate compliance regime.

Regarding the functions of a compliance system, there was a common  understanding that these would encompass a facilitative as well as  an enforcement element. The US said 'different sets of people'  would exercise these functions, and the EU suggested one body with  two distinctive branches. JAPAN and SWITZERLAND proposed a single  body exercising its facilitative and enforcement functions in a  graduated manner.

On the eligibility to raise issues, many delegates agreed that a  Party could raise an issue about its own compliance, and that a  Party or group of Parties could raise an issue about another  Party's compliance. The EU, CANADA, CHINA, JAPAN, IRAN, SOUTH  AFRICA and the US opposed a triggering role for the Secretariat.  Delegates emphasized its information-gathering function and the  need for it to preserve objectivity and neutrality.

Regarding the Expert Review Teams (ERTs), the EU said the ERTs'  reports would be automatically submitted to the compliance  committee through the Secretariat. CANADA said the reports would  be the factual basis that determined the need for further steps.  CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA, said it was  inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a  triggering role. The US and AUSTRALIA suggested guidelines for a  possible referral to the compliance body.

On the role of the COP/MOP, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CHINA,  opposed by SOUTH AFRICA, proposed that it have a triggering role  as well as the competence to decide on the findings of the  compliance body. SWITZERLAND suggested that the COP/MOP, among  others, have a triggering role on the basis of Protocol Article  8.6 (implementation of the Protocol). BRAZIL suggested that the  COP/MOP only take note of the compliance body report.

On sources of information, SAMOA suggested any source the  compliance body deemed appropriate, while IRAN said Parties should  be the only source. The EU, with BRAZIL, stressed the need to  ensure confidentiality of information submitted in confidence by  Parties. SOUTH AFRICA and SAUDI ARABIA called for clear rules for  information gathering. AUSTRALIA and the US said the defending  party should be able to rebut evidence against it.

On the structure of a compliance body, a number of delegates said  it should be a standing body in order to allow consistency and  continuity in its practice, as well as to build confidence in its  work. They suggested that the body be small, composed of  scientific, technical and legal experts appointed by governments  yet acting in their personal capacity. They added that the  composition of the body should ensure equitable geographic  distribution. POLAND said there should be an equal number of  Protocol Annex B and non-Annex B Parties, and AUSTRALIA, supported  by the US, added that the composition would depend on the article  under review. SWITZERLAND, with SOUTH AFRICA, said it should be  possible to call on outside experts. He added that additional  Annex I Parties' experts should be called on when considering  Protocol Article 3. A number of delegates, opposed by SAUDI  ARABIA, stressed the need for the body to have its own rules of  procedure. The EU said these rules should be adopted by the body  itself, while KUWAIT, BRAZIL and CHINA said the COP/MOP should  adopt these rules.

On the relationship with Protocol Article 19 (dispute settlement),  several Parties said these two procedures should be kept separate.  NEW ZEALAND said the Article 19 process could be the basis for a  final appeal procedure. The UK responded that a bilateral appeal  could not flow from a multilateral process. He highlighted the  need to determine whether the compliance system or the dispute  settlement process would take precedence where the two are in  action simultaneously.

On the consequences of non-compliance, a number of delegates  emphasized that knowing the consequences in advance would ensure  predictability and deter non-compliance. Several delegates  suggested an indicative list of consequences that would be applied  gradually, taking into account the cause, type, degree and  frequency of non-compliance. They opposed the US suggestion for  automatic sanctions. JAPAN said the cost of sanctions should be  lower than the cost of withdrawal from the Protocol. The US, NEW  ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and CANADA said a possible sanction could be  the subtraction of excess emissions from the levels permitted  during the subsequent period, with a penalty rate applied.  SWITZERLAND, BRAZIL and IRAN supported financial penalties as a  last resort. AUSTRALIA said the Party concerned should have the  option to choose from a menu of consequences.

Delegates then considered, in formal and informal sessions, the  draft report of the JWG on its work during the joint SBI/SBSTA  session as well as the draft decision on the future work of the  JWG annexed to this report. Discussions focused on the level of  ambition of the JWG, in particular whether it should 'complete its  work' at COP-6, as proposed by the EU, the US and others, or 'make  substantial progress' at COP-6, as supported by SAUDI ARABIA,  KUWAIT, UAE and others. The JWG adopted the draft report, taking  note of the views expressed.

The JWG report was considered by the joint SBI/SBSTA on Wednesday,  3 November. IRAN requested SAUDI ARABIA to join the consensus  regarding the level of ambition of the JWG. SAUDI ARABIA noted  that since the joint SBI/SBSTA had recommended for adoption the  draft decision on adverse effects, he would join the consensus.

On Thursday, 4 November, the COP endorsed the JWG conclusions  (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.7) that, inter alia:*  note that much work remains to be done and the JWG must  intensify its efforts and move towards negotiation; *  invite Parties to submit any further proposals on compliance by  31 January 2000; *  confirm that a workshop on matters relating to a compliance  system will be convened in March 2000; and *  request the Co-Chairs to further develop the elements of  procedures and mechanisms relating to a compliance system for in- depth consideration at forthcoming meetings of the JWG and serve  as a basis for negotiation of a compliance system at SB-12.

The COP then adopted the draft decision on the future work of the  JWG (FCCC/CP/1999/L.21). In this decision, the COP, inter alia:*  decides that the JWG shall continue its work; and *  requests the JWG to complete its work and report on its  findings to COP-6 so as to enable the COP to adopt a decision on a  compliance system under the Protocol at its sixth session.

### SINGLE PROJECT EMISSIONS

On Wednesday, 27 October, SBSTA  considered the impact of single projects on emissions in the  commitment period. ICELAND said single projects, such as a large  industrial plant, have a greater proportional impact on emissions  in smaller countries, affecting their ability to meet emissions  targets. He called for a conclusive decision on this issue at COP- 6. CANADA expressed reservations on the issue and opposed the  draft decision tabled by Iceland at COP-4 in its current form.

On Thursday, 4 November, COP-5 endorsed SBSTA conclusions  resulting from informal consultations conducted by Ole Plougmann  (Denmark) on the impact of single projects on emissions in the  commitment period (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.17). In these conclusions  SBSTA decides to consider this issue further at SBSTA-13 with a  view to recommending a decision for adoption by COP-6.

### NATIONAL SYSTEMS, ADJUSTMENTS AND GUIDELINES

The agenda item on  national systems, adjustments and guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communications) and 8 (review of  information) was considered by SBSTA on Monday, 25 October. Taka  Hiraishi, Vice-Chair of the IPCC Inventories Task Force, reported  on the ongoing work on uncertainties and good practice in  inventory preparation.

Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN,  said they should be flexible in order to reflect differing  national circumstances. The US highlighted the need to incorporate  IPCC work relating to good practices. AUSTRALIA proposed  including, inter alia, quality assurance and quality control  procedures, links between national systems and emissions trading  systems, and links with the transfer and acquisition of AAUs.  SWITZERLAND said guidelines should include criteria for national  enforcement systems to comply with relevant guidelines, and the  establishment and treatment of data related to Protocol  mechanisms.

Regarding adjustments, CANADA noted the lack of clarity in what an  adjustment would be. With NEW ZEALAND, he expressed support for a  technical review process of inventories, noting that this is  fundamental to the development of an adjustment process. AUSTRALIA  said adjustments are intended as an element of the Protocol's  compliance system. The EU and JAPAN stated that further discussion  on technical aspects should only occur after the completion of the  IPCC's work on good practice. Following requests by some Parties,  the Chair convened a contact group chaired by Helen Plume (New  Zealand) to consider the issue further.

The contact group met three times from 29 October - 1 November to  consider the Chair's draft conclusions and an annex setting out a  preliminary list of basic elements for national systems under  Protocol Article 5.1 (national systems for GHG emissions and  removals).

On Thursday, 4 November, the COP endorsed the SBSTA conclusions on  national systems, adjustments and guidelines  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.14), whereby SBSTA is encouraged to complete by  COP-6 its work on guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.  In its conclusions, SBSTA, inter alia: requests that any  compliance-related aspects of the Article 8 review process be  taken up by the joint working group on compliance; recalls a  decision at SBSTA-10 calling on the Secretariat to organize a  workshop on national systems and issues relating to adjustments  and provide a report at SBSTA-12; agrees to consider the basic  elements of national systems outlined in the annex to the  conclusion as the basis for further work; and encourages Annex I  Parties to support efforts of those Annex I Parties undergoing the  process of transition to a market economy to develop and  consolidate their national systems through appropriate bilateral  and multilateral mechanisms.

## ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2000-2001

COP-5 adopted a draft  decision recommended by SBI-11 approving the programme budget for  the biennium 2000-2001 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.7) on Thursday, 4 November.  The final decision, inter alia: approves the programme budget for  2000-2001, amounting to US$25,286,000; approves a contingency fund  in case the UN General Assembly decides not to provide resources  for these activities in the regular UN budget; requests the  Executive Secretary to report to COP-6 on the income and budget  performance, and propose any adjustments that might be needed; and  authorizes the Executive Secretary to incur additional expenses to  offset part of the costs of activities arising from the  preparatory process leading to COP-6.

### INCOME AND BUDGET PERFORMANCE IN THE BIENNIUM 1998-1999

On  Thursday, 4 November, COP-5 adopted the draft decision on income  and budget performance in the biennium 1998-1999 and arrangements  for administrative support (FCCC/CP/1999/L.8). The decision  followed a recommendation from SBI, which considered the matter on  Wednesday, 27 October, and Monday, 1 November. The decision, inter  alia: expresses concern at the trend towards late payment by some  Parties; and requests the Executive Secretary to continue  discussions with the UN on achieving a more efficient approach  toward administrative arrangements, and report at SBI-12 on  progress made in implementing new administrative arrangements.

### INSTITUTIONAL LINKAGE OF THE FCCC SECRETARIAT TO THE UN

COP-5  endorsed draft conclusions recommended by SBI-11 on the  institutional linkage of the FCCC Secretariat to the UN  (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.11). The conclusions state that consideration of  the international juridical personality of the Secretariat should  be deferred to 2001 and taken-up in conjunction with the review of  the institutional linkage of the FCCC Secretariat to the UN, which  will be completed by 31 December of that year.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT

COP-5 endorsed the  SBI-11 Chair's draft conclusions on implementation of the  Headquarters Agreement. The conclusions state that, in a meeting  with a representative of the German Government, the FCCC Executive  Secretary noted the need for additional staff to accommodate  growing levels of activity and staff, and pointed to the need for  access to improved and affordable conference facilities. It notes  that the German representative indicated his government's  willingness to find mutually satisfactory solutions to these  issues.

## OTHER MATTERS

In a Plenary session held on Monday, 25 October, President Szyszko  recalled that Parties had decided at COP-4 to review at COP-5  outstanding issues relating to the establishment of a multilateral  consultative committee. He proposed that COP-5 Vice-President  Slade hold informal consultations. On Thursday, 4 November, Vice- President Slade reported that consensus had not been achieved.  Delegates agreed to defer consideration of the matter to COP-6.

## REPORTS OF SUBSIDIARY BODIES

### SBSTA

SBSTA-11, chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway), held 14  meetings between Monday, 25 October, and Wednesday, 3 November,  including three joint SBI/SBSTA sessions. SBSTA considered 14  agenda items, including, inter alia: organizational matters,  implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and consideration of  Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 (adverse effects); AIJ; mechanisms;  capacity building; Annex I communications; non-Annex I  communications; and methodological issues, including LULUCF. Draft  conclusions on these items were considered by the COP, and can be  found under the relevant sections of this report.

The following issues were also considered by SBSTA: 'best  practices' in policies and measures; cooperation with relevant  international organizations; impacts and adaptation assessment  methods; the estimation of emissions of carbon dioxide from forest  harvesting and wood products; and the roster of experts nominated  by Parties. SBSTA conclusions on these issues were noted by the  COP as part of the SBSTA report.

###     'Best Practices' in Policies and Measures:

On Wednesday, 27  October, SBSTA Chair Dovland (Norway) announced that Denmark will  host a workshop in April 2000 on 'best practices' in policies and  measures. The EU said the upcoming workshop should consider, inter  alia, defining 'best practices' and assessing the extent to which  international cooperation may enhance effectiveness of policies  and measures. AUSTRALIA preferred reference to 'good' rather than  'best' practices and, with JAPAN and the US, said policies and  measures should reflect national circumstances. SAUDI ARABIA said  the workshop should also address 'wrong practices.' Following  informal consultations conducted by Chair Dovland, SBSTA adopted  the Chair's draft conclusions on 'best practices' in policies and  measures (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.10) on Thursday, 4 November. In  these conclusions, SBSTA, inter alia: accepts the offer of Denmark  in collaboration with France to host a workshop to assess best  practices in Policies and measures; and decides to consider the  report of the workshop at SBSTA-12, and report the results to COP- 6.

###     Cooperation with Relevant International Organizations:

On Monday,  1 November, SBSTA adopted draft conclusions on cooperation with  relevant international organizations relating to United Nations  bodies (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.19); and other conventions  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.20). The conclusions on cooperation with UN  bodies note a project proposal prepared by the Secretariat in  conjunction with UNEP, UNCTAD, UNIDO and UNDP, request the  Secretariat to take account of all relevant COP decisions in  relation to the project, and invite the WHO to report to SBSTA-12  on its activities related to the risk to human health from climate  change, in order to identify how cooperation could be  strengthened.

In its conclusions on cooperation with other relevant  international organizations, SBSTA requests the Secretariat to  explore possible ways of strengthening cooperation with other  conventions on issues of common interest.

###     Roster of Experts Nominated by Parties:

After consideration of the  matter on Thursday, 28 October, SBSTA adopted the Chair's draft  conclusions relating to the roster of experts nominated by Parties  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/ L.16) on Monday, 1 November. The draft  conclusions state that SBSTA: concludes that the rosters should be  integrated into one roster; requests the Secretariat to design a  unified roster; invites Parties to nominate additional experts;  and encourages Parties to make additional nominations to meet the  special needs of the technical review process for GHG inventories  submitted by Annex I Parties, which begins in 2000.

###     Other Issues:

SBSTA also adopted conclusions on information on  impacts and adaptation assessment methods (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.12);  and the estimation of emissions of carbon dioxide from forest  harvesting and wood products (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.6). The  conclusions on impacts and adaptation methods state that SBSTA,  inter alia: notes the information on the Secretariat web site  related to decision tools, methodologies to evaluate impacts and  adaptation strategies; requests the Secretariat to utilize experts  on the roster on methodologies to review information submitted by  Parties and organizations; and requests the Secretariat to prepare  a progress report for SBSTA-12.

The conclusions on wood products state that SBSTA invites Parties  to submit their views on approaches for estimating and accounting  for emissions of carbon dioxide from forest harvesting and wood  products by 12 March 2001, for consideration by SBSTA-14.

###     Report on SBSTA-11:

Delegates to SBSTA adopted the draft report of  SBSTA-11 (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.11) outlining its work and outcomes,  on Wednesday, 3 November. The COP took note of the report on  Thursday, 4 November.

### SBI

SBI-11 held nine meetings between Monday, 25 October, and  Wednesday, 3 November, including three joint SBI/SBSTA sessions,  and was chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda). SBI considered  14 agenda items, including, inter alia: organizational matters,  implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and consideration of  Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14 (adverse effects); AIJ; mechanisms,  capacity building; Annex I communications; non-Annex I  communications; and arrangements for intergovernmental meetings.  Draft conclusions on these items were considered by the COP, and  can be found under the relevant sections of this report.

###     Annual Inventories of National GHG Data for 1996:

On Wednesday, 27  October, SBI considered the report on Annex I Parties' GHG  inventory data for 1990-1997. The US, with POLAND, stressed that  timeliness and completeness of submissions were critical in  providing a basis for COP action. The EU noted that its future  national systems would fulfill quality and time requirements, and  expressed concern about the continuous increase in GHG emissions  since 1990. Chair Ashe said he would prepare draft conclusions for  SBI's consideration. On Monday, 1 November, SBI adopted Chair  Ashe's draft conclusions on GHG inventory data for 1996  (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.9) that, inter alia: note further efforts are  required to ensure adherence to the guidelines for preparation of  national communications by Annex I Parties; and invite Parties  experiencing difficulties with submitting GHG inventories in a  timely manner to provide a submission to the Secretariat  describing the nature of these difficulties.

###     Report on SBI-11:

Delegates to SBI adopted the draft report of  SBI-11 (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.11) outlining its work and outcomes on  Wednesday, 3 November. The COP took note of the report on  Thursday, 4 November.

## HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

From 2-4 November, ministers and heads of delegation met in a  high-level segment. On Tuesday, 2 November, 93 ministers and other  heads of delegations presented policy statements. On Wednesday, 3  November, there was an exchange of views among participants  organized around two themes: progress made in dealing with climate  change, and promoting implementation of the BAPA and early entry  into force of the Kyoto Protocol.

After COP-5 President Jan Szyszko opened the high-level segment,  UNEP Executive Director Klaus TÃ¶pfer said developed countries need  to address their consumption and production patterns, stressing  that technologies were available to reach the Protocol target. He  said ratification by 2002 was achievable.

FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar said that for  there to be successful negotiations based on the BAPA: leading  industrial economies should engage in early domestic action; the  CDM should be made the cornerstone of a North-South compact at  COP-6; the bottlenecks in the delivery and consideration of non- Annex I Parties' national communications should be addressed; a  credible regime prohibiting targets from being achieved solely  through 'hot air' and 'sinks' must be developed; and the Protocol  must enter into force by 2002.

### POLICY STATEMENTS

Following the opening addresses, delegates  heard ministers and heads of delegation deliver policy statements.  The following is a summary of the key themes discussed during this  session.

### Protocol Ratification:

Numerous Parties supported the Protocol's  entry into force by Rio+10 in 2002 including, inter alia:  BULGARIA, CARICOM, the EU, FRANCE, GERMANY, HAITI, IRELAND, ITALY,  JAPAN, SPAIN, SWEDEN, and the UK. The EU said more ambitious  emissions reduction commitments than those agreed to at Kyoto were  needed.

### Mechanisms:

Many Parties said the mechanisms should be  supplementary to domestic action. The EU proposed setting a  ceiling on the use of the mechanisms. Several Parties supported  the prompt adoption of principles and modalities, rules and  guidelines for the mechanisms. The G-77/CHINA said differences in  the nature, scope, purpose of and participation in the three  mechanisms should be determined first. The US called for the  mechanisms to be designed cost effectively and developing  countries to participate meaningfully.

### CDM

The G-77/CHINA indicated that the host government should  determine whether a particular project meets its sustainable  development objectives. Several Parties said nuclear energy  projects should not be eligible under the CDM or JI. A number of  developing country Parties said the eradication of poverty  continues to be their overriding priority and said the GEF should  continue to finance projects that are not eligible under the CDM.  The AFRICAN GROUP said issues of afforestation, reforestation and  the preservation/reclamation of wetlands should feature highly  among CDM projects.

### Compliance:

Many Parties called for an effective and strong  compliance system. The G-77/CHINA called for a comprehensive,  efficient and fair compliance system. The EU called for a revised  negotiating text for a decision to be adopted at COP-6.

### AIJ

The G-77/CHINA supported the continuation of the pilot phase  and, with ZAMBIA, highlighted the imbalance in the geographical  distribution of AIJ projects.

### Development and Transfer of Technology:

The G-77/CHINA indicated  that developing countries are constrained by lack of: necessary  technologies and 'know-how'; appropriate institutions and  financial resources; and regular fora to exchange ideas and build  positions. Several developing Parties said the transfer of  environmentally-sound technologies (ESTs) is the only way to  guarantee that developing countries will develop in a sustainable  manner.

### Sinks/LULUCF:

AUSTRALIA and others said the inclusion of sinks  could lower the cost of abatement action and thereby contribute to  a better outcome. AOSIS was concerned that the inclusion of land- use change in national inventories may allow countries to  recalculate their inventories and 'erase' the bulk of what was  achieved at Kyoto.

### Adverse Effects:

The G-77/CHINA, NEPAL and others said developing  countries are the most affected by climate change, and Annex I  countries must implement their commitments relating to provision  of financial resources and technology transfer. Several developing  country Parties stressed the need to operationalize FCCC Articles  4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects).

### Participation/Voluntary Commitments:

Many Parties noted the need  for global participation. AOSIS and others stated that, at the  appropriate time, it will be necessary for all countries to  participate formally in the effort to reduce GHG emissions.  ARGENTINA announced its adoption of a voluntary target to reduce  its GHG emissions and stated that it does not intend to abandon  its status as a non-Annex I Party. She said their target would be  to achieve a 2 to 10% reduction below a 'business-as-usual'  scenario in the 2008-2012 period. KAZAKHSTAN said it intended to  join FCCC Annex I. JAPAN, the US, AUSTRALIA and others welcomed  the initiatives by Kazakhstan and Argentina. The EU said a  possible way of making all countries limit their GHG emissions is  to agree on increasing global participation after the first  commitment period. CHINA and INDIA said Annex I countries have the  main responsibility. CHINA said it would not undertake commitments  until it achieves a 'medium development level.' Domestic Action: Many Parties said domestic policies and measures  should be the main means to fulfill the Kyoto targets. The G-77/CHINA and AOSIS expressed disappointment at recent emissions  data revealing that many Annex I Parties are significantly  exceeding 1990 levels. The EU said industrialized countries must  take the lead in reducing their GHG emissions.

### Capacity Building:

The G-77/CHINA, the AFRICAN GROUP and others  said capacity building is necessary to ensure meaningful  participation from developing countries. BANGLADESH called on  Parties to earmark funds from the GEF for LDCs. GERMANY urged  donor countries to provide the financial means to sustain the  operations of the GEF.

### Non-Annex I Communications:

The G-77/CHINA highlighted  insufficient financial resources to meet the 'agreed full costs'  in the preparation of non-Annex I communications.

In addition, Parties highlighted the need for: a financial  mechanism to assist SIDS in achieving adaptive capacity; strong  leadership from Annex I countries in taking responsibility for  action on climate change; and a meeting to explore the needs of  EITs.

### EXCHANGE OF VIEWS

On Wednesday, 3 November, delegates met to  exchange views during morning and afternoon sessions.

### Progress Made:

During the morning session, delegates exchanged  views on progress made in dealing with climate change and on  lessons and challenges. Several developing country Parties  stressed the need for technology transfer, capacity building,  financial resources and adaptation to address climate change. Some  Parties urged an increased focus on renewable energy. BHUTAN and  BANGLADESH called for special attention to LDCs' needs. NEW  ZEALAND underscored the need for greater attention to GHGs other  than CO2.

INDONESIA emphasized the importance of making benefit assessments,  not just cost assessments, of the Protocol. He called for the  Protocol's entry into force by 2002. SWITZERLAND, JAPAN and the  NETHERLANDS urged Parties not to wait for ratification before  starting to implement actions to address climate change.

On lessons learned, FINLAND, with CANADA, underscored good working  relationships between all partners and stakeholders in  implementing climate change policies. She added that there is a  need to set the framework and rules for market operations. Some  Parties called for the involvement of the private sector. The  EUROPEAN COMMISSION said experience has shown that reducing  emissions has been less costly than expected and has led to  greater benefits. With SWITZERLAND and HUNGARY, she emphasized the  need for increased domestic action and called for continuation of  AIJ and a smooth transition in the future to the CDM and JI.

MALAYSIA and MEXICO sought consistency in policies between  different environmental fora. BULGARIA called for a meeting to  address the specific features of EITs before COP-6. GERMANY said  addressing climate change could create new jobs. IRAN highlighted  the need for confidence-building between developed and developing  countries through concrete practical cooperation. CHINA said  attempts by some Parties to get developing countries to  'meaningfully participate' were destroying confidence-building  efforts between developing and developed countries.

### The Way Forward:

During the afternoon session, delegates exchanged  views on the way forward in relation to promoting implementation  of the BAPA and the early entry into force of the Protocol.

On outcomes from COP-5, the UK, supported by KAZAKHSTAN and the  US, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed a Bonn Declaration  reaffirming the political will to complete the BAPA by COP-6.  KUWAIT said this proposal was premature.

On preparations for COP-6, many Parties called for intensified  efforts and for the role of the President to be strengthened in  order to achieve success at COP-6. ARGENTINA, supported by FINLAND  and BENIN, said innovative approaches were needed, and called for  the establishment of small task forces in the run-up to COP-6. She  said traditional groupings among countries to develop common  positions may no longer be appropriate.

JAPAN, supported by KAZAKHSTAN, BOTSWANA, the US, CANADA, BENIN,  ICELAND, HONDURAS and SOUTH AFRICA, suggested that President  Szyszko be empowered to appoint a special facilitator to assist  negotiations and help Parties realize the BAPA by COP-6. AUSTRALIA  proposed establishing a Committee of the Whole (COW), chaired by a  facilitator vested with the authority by President Szyszko.

CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, VENEZUELA, KUWAIT, INDONESIA, and LIBYA,  opposed the proposals to establish new groups or mechanisms to  assist progress toward COP-6, stressing that the existing FCCC  bodies and structures should be employed to this end. CHINA,  supported by KUWAIT and others, said a facilitator would not be  able to visit and confer with all Parties. NORWAY said ministers  should be engaged in the process between the COPs.

On Thursday, 4 November, President Szyszko offered his personal  impressions of the high-level segment. He stated that the  discussions had been frank and open, and said he sensed a new  spirit market by political commitment and a strong willingness to  move the process forward. He noted unanimity on the need to  intensify negotiations in the lead-up to COP-6.

## OTHER PLENARY STATEMENTS

On Tuesday, 2 November, delegates met in a Plenary session to hear  statements by observer States, IGOs, NGOs and UN bodies. On  progress made in climate change negotiations, PALAU said it was  disappointed at the lack of progress being made at COP-5. OPEC  said implementing the Protocol would lead to dramatic economic  losses for OPEC Parties, and called for equitable distribution of  the costs of climate change mitigation. FRANCISCAN INTERNATIONAL  and CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK - EUROPE (CAN-E), called for the entry  into force of the Protocol by Rio+10.

Regarding the Protocol mechanisms, the WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT urged an early definition of mechanisms'  governing structure and recommended that existing trade and  investment frameworks be used. CAN-E said the CDM and JI should  exclude nuclear power, clean coal and large hydro schemes. UNDP  offered capacity-building assistance for CDM and JI. UNIDO said it  was committed to the CDM's success in Africa. CAN-SOUTHEAST ASIA  said trying to link AIJ to CDM would create another loophole  permitting Parties to renege on their commitments. The WORLD BANK  noted that its programmes on AIJ had provided useful lessons for  both North and South, and expressed willingness to expand it to  cover countries that had been less well served by the pilot phase.  FRANCISCAN INTERNATIONAL said JI should be used to promote clean  development and opposed nuclear energy as an option. The NUCLEAR  ENERGY FORUM said the choice of nuclear energy must be based on  each country's circumstances.

On the development and transfer of technologies, the BUSINESS  COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY highlighted the need to encourage  private sector participation.

On interlinkages, the CONVENTION TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION, the  CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, and the RAMSAR CONVENTION ON  WETLANDS noted synergies and the potential for further cooperation  between the FCCC and their respective conventions.

Special Scientific Segment: In a special scientific Plenary  segment, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) indicated  that the atmospheric concentration of human-induced GHGs and the  mean surface temperature of the earth would continue to increase,  and noted that the expected recovery of stratospheric ozone will  lead to the strengthening of GHG atmospheric concentrations. The  IPCC said it is not a question of whether the earth's climate will  change, but rather when, where and by how much. UNEP emphasized  domestic action and urged Parties to ratify the Protocol to ensure  entry into force by 2002.

## CLOSING PLENARY

In its closing Plenary on Friday, 5 November, the COP adopted the  report of its work with a minor amendment by the G-77/CHINA and  authorized Rapporteur Guerreiro to finalize the report  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.1). Michael Zammit Cutajar said the unexpected  mood of optimism and the orderly and productive conduct of  business was encouraging to the Secretariat as they prepared to  face 'the Y2K problem' of helping produce a successful outcome at  COP-6.

The G-77/CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA and the EU, highlighted  the cordial and businesslike atmosphere at COP-5. She said the  group has shown flexibility in the negotiations and look forward  to working with the same spirit at future meetings. The EU said  COP-5 had achieved results that will pave the way to COP-6.

CHINA noted the meaningful participation of the G-77/CHINA in the  negotiation process. He commented on the spirit of understanding  that prevailed at COP-5 and said it should extend to COP-6. He  added that no extraneous controversial matters should be brought  up at COP-6. The AFRICAN GROUP noted the early finish of the COP  with approbation. He expressed gratitude to the Annex I countries  that had shown a flexible attitude at COP-5. KAZAKHSTAN and SYRIA  thanked the host country for its hospitality. In his closing  remarks, President Szyszko said COP-5 had taken an important step  towards fulfilling the BAPA, and closed the conference at 1:00 pm.

## A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF COP-5

### THE HARE AND THE TORTOISE

The Fifth Conference of the Parties completed its work ahead of  schedule and generated an 'unexpected mood of optimism' among  delegates and observers. After a faltering COP in Buenos Aires,  followed by a year of grim 'drum beats' of speculation in many  capitals about the fate of the Kyoto Protocol, the process  recovered vital momentum and began to gather determination and  support for a self-imposed deadline for entry into force by 2002.  An innovative exchange of views involving ministers launched a  year of intensive high-level engagement in the process leading up  to COP-6. The 2002 deadline, the 10th anniversary of the Earth  Summit (UNCED), provides the Parties and civil society with a  compelling set of reasons to succeed. As the fabled tortoise once  taught the hare, momentum and pace do not always deliver the  price. The integrity and credibility of the Protocol will be the  prize that endures, one that demands perseverance and vigilance  along the way.

This brief analysis will address three of the questions posed by  the FCCC Executive Secretary, Michael Zammit Cutajar, in a  briefing paper issued before the start of COP-5. Our three  questions are:*  Has COP-5 pulled together the 'big picture' and clarified the  various strands of work and decisions required? *  Has COP-5 enabled different interest groups to define specific  components of success at COP-6 and secured their political  commitment? *  Are there indications that COP-5 has sent a signal to the world  about a change of pace and a sharpening of focus? These questions are based on a recognition that COP-5's success or  otherwise would be judged by its contribution to preparations for  COP-6, when far reaching decisions mandated by the Buenos Aires  Action Plan will have to be made regarding a volatile mix of  political and so-called technical issues.

## THE 'BIG PICTURE' AND CLARIFICATION OF OUTSTANDING DECISIONS  REQUIRED

At a COP-5 briefing, Zammit Cutajar described information as the  lifeblood of the FCCC and Kyoto Protocol. Information will be key  to the integrity of the enabling decisions mandated under the  Buenos Aires Action Plan. Two developments underlined his point.  The IPCC special side event on land-use, land-use change and  forestry (LULUCF) provided the first opportunity for many  delegations to engage in a frank exchange on the absence of  country-specific data for baselines and consideration of  'additional activities' (Protocol Article 3.4). At another side  event, the University of Wageningen (Netherlands) presented a  powerful tool to allow Parties to assess the likely impact on the  Kyoto targets if potential new sinks are allowed. The Climate  Action Network believes that the overall impact of the additional  activities could create a more significant loophole than 'hot  air.' Information will be key to the integrity of the enabling decisions  mandated under the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. The obvious  danger, which appeared to lurk in some corners of the negotiation  process in the run-up to COP-5, was the politically-motivated  temptation to build carefully constructed 'designer gaps' into  important reporting guidelines and scientific data requirements.  Delegations and NGOs agreed that some of the Parties' notable work  at COP-5 vindicated the importance of rigor in their approaches to  the provision of information. There was also a drawing back from  any temptation to pre-empt the availability of scientific advice  from the IPCC on the complex set of decisions to be taken on sinks  and 'additional activities' under the LULUCF, a classic example of  a negotiating area where the division between 'technical' and  'political' issues breaks down. Any attempt to reconstruct or  force the division between the technical and political in this  regime can only be described as a politically-motivated strategy  in itself.

Regarding some of the key issues, we shall attempt a first take on  the direction of the COP-5 debates, bearing in mind the question  of how well the Parties managed to pull together the 'big picture'  by clarifying the various strands of work and decision-making to  come.

### Compliance:

One observer described the US approach to compliance  as its 'only green position,' such is its commitment to a robust  and rigorous system. Ultimately the credibility of the compliance  system will be bound to the types of consequences and sanctions  envisaged, and to the overall rigor of the Protocol mechanisms and  their capacity to bring about real reductions in GHG emissions.

### Annex I Communications:

The adoption of the guidelines for the  preparation of Annex I communications and the guidelines for the  technical review of GHG inventories was seen as one of the  achievements COP-5, a first step toward a more rigorous analysis  of inventories. Debate on Part II of the guidelines for the  preparation of national communications by Annex I Parties  reflected tensions over emphasis on domestic versus offshore or  least cost fulfillment of national commitments.

### Non-Annex I Communications:

Another achievement was the decision  on non-Annex I Communications. A decision to create a consultative  group of experts, consisting of members predominately from non- Annex I Parties, will reduce some developing countries' anxieties  that data will be used to press for target setting and ranking of  performance, resulting in an imposition of new conditionalities  for access to GEF funding.

### LULUCF

Observers expressed relief that Parties demonstrated a  preparedness to produce data for the IPCC report on additional  sink-related activities. This will add to the transparency  required if future budgets are to be calculated on the basis of  additional activities. Parties also agreed on a framework and  timeline for how IPCC and related workshops and country data will  be integrated.

### AIJ Under the Pilot Phase:

This issue, the only one which required  a final resolution at COP-5, exposed the fissures developing  within the G-77/China on issues related to the mechanisms and  conflicting perceptions regarding possible gains to be realized.

### Mechanisms:

Delegates engaged in a 'brainstorming' session on  project cycles and basic operations. Although they did not  'negotiate' the synthesis of Parties' proposals, some difficult  issues, such as fungibility, were discussed for the first time.  Delegates agreed that the synthesis will serve as the basis for  future sessions.

### Capacity Building and Technology Transfer:

The COP set up a  process for serious consideration of these issues, which often  seem to have a tenuous relationship with economic realities. The  importance of progress must be seen within the emerging view  within Annex I Parties that confidence building must form part of  any package requiring the non-Annex I Parties' cooperation and the  long-term viability of the FCCC.

## KEEPING INTEREST GROUPS ON BOARD

### OVERCOMING OPEC'S PERVERSE  IMPACTS AND HONORING THE GLOBAL COMPACT

Each negotiating stage in the FCCC and Protocol process demands  that diverse interest groups within and across Annex I and non- Annex I countries can define specific components of success, or  the prospects of success at COP-6. In turn, the conditions for  their continued commitment to the overall integrity of the process  is assured. There is no greater test for the process than the  balance that must be struck between the objectives of the FCCC and  the Protocol and the interests of the oil producing States,  notably OPEC. This balance also illustrates the tensions and  volatility of the G-77/China vis Ã  vis its engagement with the  process. The obstructive role played by Saudi Arabia and other  OPEC interests at COP-5 was the subject of some speculation. The  OPEC position seems to be based on the fear that ratification and  implementation of the Protocol will have a significant impact on  oil consumption. An example was the Saudi Arabian delegation's use  of its position as G-77/China coordinator on the bunker fuel issue  to pursue its own interests as an oil producing country at the  expense of the wider group. Members of the delegation failed to  respond to repeated attempts to have them participate in the  intensive informal negotiations. When they finally did, elements  in a draft decision addressing the ICAO and IMO were gutted.  Within the G-77/China, however, many Parties are challenging the  Saudis' attempts to usurp some of the Group's negotiating  positions for its own ends.

One of the significant outcomes from COP-4 was a concerted  attempt, driven at the time by the EU and now taken up by other  Annex I Parties, to honor the spirit of the global compact that  remains the foundation of the post-UNCED agenda. Work on the  consultative process on technology transfer, capacity building,  the continuing AIJ pilot phase and the design of the CDM will  provide opportunities for Annex I Parties to honor this commitment  and lay the foundations for a constructive engagement with key  non-Annex I Parties with a view to addressing the question of  wider participation. Some NGOs will be pressing the EU to play a  greater role in establishing this dialogue, accompanied by serious  attempts to address the adaptation concerns of some developing  Parties. Given their vulnerability to global warming, adaptation  is an issue of particular interest to AOSIS, who is pressing for a  Protocol that brings real and measurable GHG reductions.

## A NEW PACE AND FOCUS

### SENDING A POWERFUL SIGNAL TO THE WORLD

The twin decisions to convene COP-6 in the year 2000 (rather than  delay it until 2001) and intensify the work programme during the  intersessional period will help to set a lively pace for  negotiations on outstanding issues and sharpen the focus of  debates. Additional subsidiary body meetings and intensive high- level exchanges will be reminiscent of those that characterized  the period leading up to Kyoto.

The NGO campaign calling for the Protocol's entry into force by  the tenth anniversary of the Earth Summit in 2002 has also taken  hold. The NGO community plays a central role in the negotiations,  working for transparency and rigor in the process and providing a  'user friendly' point of access for civil society. A sharper focus  for NGO work will be provided by a call for a European Leadership  initiative launched by Hermann Ott (Wuppertal Institute) and  Sebastian OberthÃºr (Ecologic) at COP-5, calling for an EU and  Japanese-led coalition to achieve early entry into force of the  Protocol. NGOs have also worked hard to encourage Parties to  exclude the nuclear option from consideration under the JI and CDM  mechanisms.

## HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE A TORTOISE TO ARRIVE IN THE HAGUE?

There was a palpable sense of renewed optimism at COP-5's close,  encouraged by a determination to inject a quicker pace into the  process of fulfilling the BAPA mandate at COP-6. As the tortoise  once taught the fabled hare, however, speed is not the only  requirement for success. For each question clarified at COP-5,  others were deferred or not raised at all. For each attempt to  keep interest groups, such as OPEC, on board, there will be new  fissures for laggards to exploit in pursuit of delay and  obfuscation. For every powerful signal of political intent, there  will be outbursts of systemic inertia in political capitals, no  more so than when Washington becomes a well-lit stage for the  numbing spectacle of a Presidential election. From the humble  tortoise we might learn that success must also be guided by pace,  concentration, and perseverance, backed up by a steady nerve and  rock solid defenses to help endure the inevitable arrival of  extreme events along the way.
