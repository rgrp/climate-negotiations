abstract: "The Sixth Conference of the Parties (COP-6) to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the resumed  thirteenth sessions of the UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies begin today  in The Hague, the Netherlands. At least 6,000 participants are  expected to attend, including ministers and high-level officials  from approximately 160 governments. The meeting aims to set the  operational details for commitments on reducing emissions of  greenhouse gases under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Delegates will  also seek to reach agreement on actions to strengthen  implementation of the UNFCCC itself. The outcome of COP-6 is seen  as crucial in furthering implementation of the UNFCCC and  influencing ratification and entry into force of the Protocol."

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC - THE ROAD TO COP-6

### INTRODUCTION TO THE UNFCCC

Climate change is considered to be one  of the most serious threats to the sustainability of the world's  environment, human health and well-being, and the global economy.  Mainstream scientists agree that the Earth's climate is being  affected by the build-up of greenhouse gases, such as carbon  dioxide, caused by human activities, including electricity  generation, agriculture and transportation. Despite some lingering  uncertainties, a majority of scientists believe that precautionary  and prompt action is necessary.

The international response to climate change took shape with the  development of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change (UNFCCC). Agreed to in 1992, the UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action to control greenhouse gas emissions. Its aim  is to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases at  a level that would prevent anthropogenic (human-induced) actions  from leading to 'dangerous interference' with the climate system.  The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, 90 days after the  receipt of the 50th ratification. It has now received 184  instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession.  Since it entered into force, five meetings of the Conference of  the Parties (COP) have taken place, as well as numerous workshops  and meetings of the UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies - the Subsidiary  Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for  Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

The Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate,  established by  COP-1, met between 1995 and 1997 to reach  agreement on a further step in efforts to combat climate change.  Following intense negotiations, delegates to COP-3, which was held  in Kyoto, Japan in December 1997, agreed to a Protocol to the  UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries making the  transition to a market economy to achieve quantified targets for  decreasing their emissions of greenhouse gases. These countries,  known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to  reducing their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at  least 5% below 1990 levels over the period between 2008 and 2012,  with differentiated targets for most of these countries. The  Protocol also establishes three mechanisms to assist Annex I  Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively. The  mechanisms include an emissions trading system, joint  implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex  I Parties, and a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to encourage  joint projects between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.

While delegates in Kyoto agreed to these emissions reductions  targets and methods, it was left for subsequent meetings to decide  on most of the rules and operational details that will determine  how these cuts are achieved and how countries' efforts are  measured and assessed. Although many countries have signed the  Protocol, the majority are waiting until these operational details  are negotiated before deciding whether or not to ratify. To enter  into force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the  UNFCCC, including Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the  total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990. Currently only 30 Parties  have ratified the Protocol.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

The Fourth Conference of the  Parties (COP-4) met in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 1998  to set out a work schedule for reaching agreement on the  operational details of the Protocol and for strengthening  implementation of the UNFCCC itself. This work schedule was  outlined in a document called the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. The  critical deadline under the Plan of Action is COP-6, which marks  the culmination of this process.

At COP-6, delegates will attempt to reach agreement on a package  of issues related to the Protocol and the UNFCCC. Critical  Protocol-related issues needing resolution include rules relating  to the mechanisms, a regime for monitoring countries' compliance  with their commitments, and accounting methods for national  emissions and emissions reductions. Rules on crediting countries  for removing carbon from the atmosphere through planting trees,  and possibly other measures, will also be addressed. Issues under  the UNFCCC that need resolution include questions of capacity  building, the transfer and development of technology, and  assistance to those developing countries that are especially  vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change or to actions  taken by industrialized countries to combat climate change.

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP-6

COP-6 has been preceded by numerous formal  and informal meetings and consultations held during 1999 and 2000.  The UNFCCC subsidiary bodies held their tenth sessions in Bonn,  Germany, from 31 May - 11 June 1999, and began the formal process  of fulfilling the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Issues considered  at this meeting included the development and transfer of  technology, the mechanisms, and compliance. This work was  continued at COP-5, held in Bonn from 25 October - 5 November  1999, which was attended by over 3000 participants.

During the first few months of 2000, several UNFCCC technical  workshops were held to assist the process leading to COP-6. These  workshops related to: a compliance system under the Protocol;  adverse effects of climate change and the impact of implementation  of response measures; guidelines under Articles 5 (methodological  issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of  information) of the Protocol; best practices in domestic policies  and measures to address greenhouse gas emissions; and technology  transfer.

### SB-12

Work resumed at a formal level with the twelfth sessions of  the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies, held from 12-16 June 2000, in Bonn,  and preceded by one week of informal meetings. At this meeting,  participants developed negotiating text on critical issues such as  the mechanisms and compliance.

### SB-13

Informal consultations and workshops were held during July  and August 2000, followed by the first part of the thirteenth  sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB-13), held from 11-15  September 2000 in Lyon, France, and again preceded by a week of  informal meetings. During the informal meetings and the first part  of SB-13, delegates discussed text for decisions covering a range  of technical and political issues, with the aim of preparing text  for a comprehensive agreement at COP-6. The first part of SB-13  was suspended on 15 September. It resumes in The Hague on 13  November.

Many delegates and observers at SB-13 Part I expressed concern at  the slow rate of progress and the significant amount of work  remaining for delegates at The Hague. Political positions on the  key issues remained entrenched, with little indication of  willingness to compromise or move forward. While negotiating text  emerged on the key elements of the Plan of Action - mechanisms,  compliance, adverse effects, technology transfer, land use, land- use change and forestry (LULUCF), and policies and measures -  significant disagreements remain. In some cases, negotiations  almost ground to a halt, indicating an apparent unwillingness of  Parties to make even relatively minor concessions. With many  technical and political questions yet to be resolved, observers  questioned whether COP-6 will succeed.

### INTERSESSIONAL CONSULTATIONS SINCE SB-13

Several informal  meetings and consultations have been held since SB-13 in an effort  to further progress on outstanding issues and to continue to  narrow differences on negotiating texts.

### Articles 5, 7 and 8:

Informal consultations on Articles 5, 7 and 8  were held in Bonn, from 6-8 October. As a result of these  consultations, as well as the inputs by Parties during SB-13 Part  I, a new text has been developed by the Co-Chairs of the relevant  SBSTA contact group. This text (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/13) will function  as a parallel text to the negotiating text tabled during SB-13  Part I.

### LULUCF

Informal consultations on LULUCF took place in Viterbo,  Italy, from 9-11 October. A revised Co-Chairs' text was developed  after the informal consultations (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/12). The text,  which also incorporates views expressed by Parties during SB-13  Part I, will serve to facilitate and advance negotiations at  SBSTA-13 Part II, and complements the Co-Chairs' text tabled at  the negotiations in Lyon.

### Compliance:

Informal consultations were held in New Delhi, India,  from 12-14 October. A new text proposed by the Co-Chairs of the  Joint Working Group on Compliance (JWG), to be used as the basis  for negotiations at the second part of SB-13 (FCCC/SB/2000/11),  was developed. The text has been streamlined, with options clearly  identified and combined.

### Mechanisms:

These consultations took place in New Delhi, from 16- 18 October. They resulted in a new text, based also on views  submitted by Parties during SB-13 Part I, aimed at facilitating  and advancing discussions at SB-13 Part II (FCCC/SB/2000/10, Add.  1-4). The text comprises a note by the Co-Chairs, clarifying its  mandate and scope, as well as addenda with text on Articles 6  (JI), 12 (CDM) and 17 (emissions trading), and on registries.

### Adverse Effects:

This meeting took place in Geneva, from 19-21  October. The text for consideration at SB-13 Part II that came out  of this consultation (FCCC/SB/2000/12) attempts to clarify the  positions of Parties. It contains a report on the informal  consultations and, as an annex, the draft elements of a work  programme related to UNFCCC Article 4.9 (adverse effects on least  developed countries) and other obligations under the UNFCCC and  Protocol.

### Other Meetings:

Informal high-level consultations to prepare for  COP-6 took place at Mulden, the Netherlands, in early October.  Chaired by Jan Pronk, the Dutch Environment Minister and  President-designate of COP-6, the meeting sought to narrow  differences and inject some urgency into discussions at the  ministerial level. In addition, a workshop on the special  situations and needs of the least developed countries (LDCs) was  held in Geneva from 16-17 October. The meeting focused on the  impact of climate change on LDCs' economies, and on funding,  insurance and technology transfer in accordance with UNFCCC  Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects) to assist LDCs in responding  to the effects of climate change. Participants developed an LDC  proposal for the COP-6 negotiations, requesting 'immediate' and  'long-term' adaptation funds for the purpose of preparing and  implementing national adaptation programmes of action.

# KEY ISSUES AT COP-6 - THE CURRENT STATUS OF NEGOTIATIONS

### A COMPLEX, DIFFICULT MEETING

COP-6 is set to be a politically- charged, complex meeting. Countries have divergent views on what  the rules and operational details governing the Protocol should  look like, as well as the actions necessary to further strengthen  the implementation of the Convention. In a recent press statement,  UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar cautioned that  'The Hague conference is a make or break opportunity for the  climate change treaties.' According to Zammit Cutajar, 'Unless  governments of developed countries take the hard decisions that  lead to real and meaningful cuts in emissions and to greater  support to developing countries, global action on climate change  will lose momentum. The meeting's success will be measured by the  early entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol - I hope by 2002, ten  years after the adoption of the Convention at the Rio Earth  Summit.'

### KEY ISSUES

Although texts have been developed at recent meetings  on the key issues to be addressed at COP-6, all of these require  further negotiation. An emphasis has been placed on achieving  agreement on the entire  'package' of issues under negotiation, in  the hope that progress on all areas is more likely to lead to an  agreement by consensus. However, accommodating all countries'  interests and aims will be difficult. The following section  outlines the key issues, including Party positions and the current  state of negotiations.

### Mechanisms:

While negotiators in Kyoto agreed that the mechanisms  developed under the Protocol could help developed countries lower  the costs of meeting their national emissions targets, countries  differ on the operational details governing the use of the  mechanisms - details that must be set at COP-6. Key decisions  include the accounting rules for allocating credits, as well as  the roles and responsibilities of various institutions. For the  CDM and JI, countries must decide which projects are eligible and  what the baselines are for measuring the emissions-reduction  contribution of any specific project. A particularly controversial  issue is whether to allow only projects that reduce emissions, or  whether to include projects that remove existing or future carbon  from the atmosphere - carbon 'sinks' projects such as  reforestation. Although differing on the specific conditions,  countries in favor of including sinks within the CDM include the  US, Canada, Australia, Japan and Norway. Inclusion is also favored  by the Environmental Integrity Group (a recently formed  negotiating group comprising Switzerland, Mexico and the Republic  of Korea), and some developing countries, such as Peru, Chile,  Colombia, Costa Rica, Bolivia and Uruguay. On the other side, the  EU, as well as developing countries such as Tuvalu, Samoa, China  and Jamaica, want sinks to be excluded from the CDM.

Another contentious issue is whether there should be a limit or  ceiling on how much of a country's emissions reduction target can  be met through the mechanisms. According to the Protocol, use of  the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic policies and  measures. The EU, with support from some developing countries, has  taken the position that a definite ceiling should be imposed on  using the mechanisms, so that they contribute to reaching no more  than 50% of a country's emissions reduction target. The  introduction of a ceiling is opposed by countries belonging to the  'Umbrella Group' - a loose alliance of Annex 1 Parties that  includes the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Norway, the Russian  Federation and Ukraine - as well as by some developing countries.

On emissions trading, an ongoing concern is that countries with  economies in transition that have experienced reductions in their  greenhouse gas emissions due to economic recession in the early  1990s will be able to sell large quantities of emissions credits -  or 'hot air' - to other Annex I Parties. This would reduce the  pressure for domestic action.

Other key issues requiring a decision by delegates include whether  a share of proceeds should be established under JI and emissions  trading, and how closely procedures for JI should mirror those for  CDM activities.

### Carbon Sinks:

The use of carbon sinks in meeting emissions targets  - which has been considered within discussions on LULUCF - is both  complex and controversial. Plants and soils can act as carbon  sinks, but the science of estimating how much carbon is being  removed from the atmosphere is uncertain. Including the use of  sinks in meeting targets on emissions will require a clear  definition of a sink, as well as clarity on what changes are the  result of deliberate climate policies. Parties must also agree on  accounting systems that set the baselines and measure carbon  changes. Issues of the permanence of carbon storage achieved  through forests and other sinks must also be addressed, given that  such carbon can be lost due to felling, forest fires and other  factors.

According to a 'non-paper' published by COP-6 President-designate  Jan Pronk on 2 November, delegates will need to determine how  reforestation will be defined, including whether to include  regeneration after the harvest cycle, what activities should be  considered under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities),  whether such activities should be considered in the first  commitment period, and whether the natural uptake of carbon should  be separated from direct human-induced effects.

### Compliance:

A key element of the Kyoto Protocol is a compliance  system that can determine whether countries have met their  commitments under the Protocol, as well as deciding what should  happen in cases of non-compliance. Delegates generally agree that  the system should provide for both facilitation and enforcement  approaches to dealing with compliance issues, with the latter only  applying to Annex I Parties. The G-77/China advocates that the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities should  govern the system and that, consequently, specific facilitation  consequences should apply to developing countries. Some developed  countries stress that it is the nature of the commitment that  should direct an issue to facilitation or enforcement  consequences. On the composition of the body dealing with  enforcement, the G-77/China urges the application of equitable  geographical representation while developed countries favor a  stronger representation of Annex I Parties. Delegates also  disagree on, inter alia, the nature of the applicable  consequences, with the EU and small island developing Parties  being the most strident in favor of strong penalties, and the  relationship between the compliance body and the Conference of the  Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties.

### Developing Country Issues:

COP-6 must also address issues that are  considered to be of particular importance in terms of  strengthening developing countries' capacity to cope with their  efforts to combat climate change. Developing countries are looking  for negotiated agreements on capacity building and transfer of  technology, particularly in relation to financial and technical  assistance from Annex I Parties. The G-77/China has expressed  frustration at what it sees as a lack of progress on these issues,  and has stated that its support for the overall 'package' of  issues being negotiated at COP-6 will depend on satisfactory  agreement on these issues.

### Adverse Effects:

Under the UNFCCC, Parties agreed to address the  needs and concerns of developing countries arising from the  adverse effects both of climate change and of the impact of  response measures to climate change. Assistance to LDCs, small  island States, countries with low-lying coastal areas and other  vulnerable countries are particularly emphasized. This issue is  also addressed in the Protocol. LDCs and small island States have  supported the need for funds to support adaptation to climate  change. In addition, developing countries - led by their oil- exporting members - have called for assistance and compensation to  address the negative economic impacts of actions taken by  industrialized countries to meet Kyoto commitments, such as  measures to reduce the consumption of imported oil. Many developed  countries have expressed serious reservations about such claims  for compensation.

### RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Ahead of COP-6, the US has circulated a non- paper which emphasizes the issue of a 'new dialogue' on developing  country commitments. This issue, which is not part of the Buenos  Aires Plan of Action, may have an impact on negotiations of the  package deal at The Hague.

Another recent development has been the publication of research  suggesting that climate models predicting global temperature  increases need to be revised upward. In a new draft report, the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change revised its earlier  predictions on temperature increases by the year 2100 from an  increase of 1 - 3.6 o centrigrade to an increase of 1.5 - 6.1 o  centigrade.
