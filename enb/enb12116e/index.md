# SBSTA

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates considered the report on the  meeting of the IPCC and the Montreal Protocol's Technical and  Economic Assessment Panel on ways and means of limiting  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons. The meeting  highlighted, inter alia: the complexity of links between ozone  depletion and climate change mitigation activities; the  multiplicity of solutions required to address these global change  issues; and the desirability of solutions tailored to regional or  national needs.

SWITZERLAND emphasized the need to standardize testing procedures  for technologies in developing countries. GREENPEACE called for  action to avoid dumping of potentially harmful technologies in  developing countries. ARGENTINA, supported by KENYA, the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION and POLAND, called for attention to the medical use of  HFCs in metered dose inhalers. Discussions will continue in  informal consultations.

On coastal adaptation technologies, AOSIS noted that financial and  human resource limitations have stifled progress in adaptation and  urged the development of long-term approaches under the FCCC. He  highlighted the potential of the clean development mechanism (CDM)  in this regard. On other matters, the Secretariat reported on its  cooperative activities aimed at improving climate data from  reporting systems.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

The Global Climate  Observation System (GCOS) reported on progress in enhancing global  observatory systems and noted that deficiencies are a result of  inadequate equipment, poor infrastructure and insufficient  funding. The Global Oceans Observation System (GOOS) outlined its  work and stressed the need for better measurement, organization  and partnerships to overcome observation deficiencies. The EU and  others supported the GCOS call for more systematic reporting.  JAPAN encouraged GCOS, in cooperation with the WMO, to monitor the  status of implementation with a view to utilizing recent  technologies to fill the gaps in climate observing systems.  AUSTRALIA called for a more diversified funding strategy. The GEF  pledged additional funds to build observational capacity for  certain developing countries. Susan Barrell (Australia) will  conduct informal consultations on this issue.

### ROSTER OF EXPERTS

The US said expansion of rosters should only be  done in response to additional tasks. NEW ZEALAND supported the  Secretariat's proposal to integrate the different rosters. While  the EU objected, CANADA supported additional rosters for inventory  reviews.

Following requests by some Parties, the Chair convened a contact  group to consider national systems, adjustments and guidelines.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

The JWG on compliance heard four diagrammatic submissions  illustrating a compliance system. The US said that its design for  the compliance system is focused on Protocol Article 3 (GHG  reduction and limitation commitments) and provides for both  facilitative and enforcement functions to be dealt with ''by two  different sets of people.'' She said the goal of enforcement is to  ensure compliance through binding consequences that are known in  advance. In presenting its preliminary views, JAPAN proposed a  single compliance body and outlined steps ranging from assistance  to recommendations to be exhausted before the entry into force of  consequences. The EU explained that its compliance committee would  have a facilitative branch and an enforcement branch, with a  possible referral from the former to the latter. Issues would be  channeled automatically to the branches. SAMOA stressed two  features of the AOSIS diagram: avoidance of polarization between  the facilitative and enforcement functions, since they overlap,  and an eligibility committee responsible for the determination of  mechanism eligibility. He added that an ad hoc appeal body would  hear quasi-judicial appeals on the imposition of binding  penalties.

On eligibility to raise issues, the UK explained that the mere  provision of information would not 'trigger' the compliance  procedure, but that it would be triggered by whatever causes the  compliance procedure to start considering a claim. Many delegates  agreed that a Party could raise an issue about its own compliance,  and that a Party or group of Parties could raise an issue about  another Party's compliance. CANADA said sufficient evidence should  be provided to support cases. IRAN said only a group of Parties  could trigger a case of another Party's compliance. The EU,  CANADA, CHINA, JAPAN, IRAN, SOUTH AFRICA and the US opposed a  triggering role for the Secretariat. Delegates emphasized its  information gathering function and the need for it to preserve  objectivity and neutrality.

Regarding the Expert Review Teams (ERTs), the EU said the ERTs'  reports would be automatically submitted to the compliance  committee through the Secretariat. CANADA said the reports were  the factual basis that determined the need for further steps.  CHINA, with IRAN, KUWAIT, BRAZIL and ARGENTINA said it was  inappropriate to give ERTs, a simple fact finding body, a  triggering role. SOUTH AFRICA explained that doing so could  endanger the objectivity of the ERTs. The US and AUSTRALIA  suggested guidelines for a possible referral to the compliance  body.

On the role of the COP/MOP, many delegates said it should give  policy guidance to the compliance body. SWITZERLAND, the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION and CHINA proposed that the COP/MOP should have a  triggering role as well as the competence to decide on the  findings of the compliance body. SOUTH AFRICA expressed concern  about due process if the COP/MOP was given both these functions.  BRAZIL suggested that the COP/MOP only take note of the compliance  body report. Several delegates said a triggering role would delay  and politicize the process. SAUDI ARABIA said the COP/MOP should  play a role 'at the beginning, at the end and in the middle' of  the compliance process.

On sources of information, AUSTRALIA and the US said that due  process required the defending party to be able to present  necessary information and rebut evidence against it. Parties  suggested several sources of information, including: the expert  review teams; outside experts; and intergovernmental  organizations. SAMOA suggested any source the compliance body  deemed appropriate, while IRAN said Parties should be the only  source. BRAZIL said sources should bear responsibility for their  information.

The EU, with BRAZIL, stressed the need to ensure confidentiality  of information submitted in confidence by Parties. SOUTH AFRICA  and SAUDI ARABIA called for clear rules for information gathering.  CHINA sought criteria for the use of information. IRAN raised the  issue of financing developing countries' efforts to provide  information.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

This contact group focused on four issues:  information gaps; the merits of holding another workshop; the  types of possible preliminary actions to be taken to mitigate the  adverse effects of climate change and response measures; and the  manner in which Protocol Article 3.14 should be dealt with by the  contact group. Co-chairs Salamat (Iran) and Kjell√©n (Sweden)  suggested that the discussion's purpose was to provide further  information to enable them to propose a draft text to the contact  group.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group continued consideration  of the co-chairs' draft text on guidelines for reporting other  issues in Annex I communications. Participants discussed  guidelines for reporting of: financial resources and technology  transfer; general policy and funding of research and systematic  observation; and national circumstances relevant to GHG removals.  Among the issues raised in the discussion on financial resources  were: whether to provide details of measures or detailed  information of the activities undertaken to implement Annex I  commitments; and how to format the reports. A smaller group will  continue consideration of the technical review guidelines.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Delegates considered the co-chair's draft  proposal on a draft decision on capacity building based on the G-77/CHINA's written proposal and integrating submissions from the  EU and the Umbrella Group. Issues raised included: the question of  whether to use the draft as a basis for negotiation; the fact that  EITs' capacity building needs were not being addressed; concern  over the statement whereby capacity building is a pre-requisite  for meaningful developing country participation; provision for an  additional workshop; lack of a country-driven and country-specific  approach; and the question of whether the submission of  information on capacity building at SB-12 would result in a  recommendation for a decision by COP-6. The co-chairs will prepare  a revised draft on the basis of this discussion and further  submissions.

### LULUCF

This contact group considered a draft schematic timetable  on the process and timing for the analysis of information provided  by the IPCC Special Report due in 2000 and the relationship of  this report to a decision-making framework regarding Protocol  Articles 3.3 (net changes in GHG emissions and removals), 3.4  (additional human induced activities related to changes in GHG  emissions and removals), 7.1 and 7.4 (guidelines for necessary  supplementary information). The group also discussed the need for  country-specific data and information, as well as their  relationship to consideration of the IPCC Special Report and to a  decision-making framework in the context of Protocol requirements.  Questions were raised on, inter alia: the need for, purposes and  uses of country-specific data and information; data requirements  under specific Protocol provisions; and types of data according to  these provisions. The group will continue consideration of data in  relation to verifiability, transparency and consistency.

### MECHANISMS

Chair Chow (Malaysia) took the participants through  the Synthesis of Parties' Proposals on Mechanisms  (FCCC/SB/1999/8). He highlighted certain sections, noted areas of  convergence and divergence, and suggested issues for  consideration. The EU, NORWAY and the US suggested ways of  consolidating and tightening the text. On the CDM, the G-77/CHINA  pointed to deficiencies in the text, including the absence of a  section on 'nature and scope' and the lack of a determination of  what the driving force of the CDM should be. On a general note,  SAUDI ARABIA reiterated its reservation on aiming for a draft  negotiating text by SB-12, as this was premature. The G-77/CHINA  said technical appendices complicate the issue and stressed the  need to address the technical issues. He also noted the need for  Parties to meet in their regional groups.

### NATIONAL SYSTEMS

This contact group considered draft conclusions  on national systems, adjustments and guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communication of information) and 8  (review of information). The group was unable to agree on wording  for a paragraph on when adjustments related to Protocol Article  5.2 (methodology) should be applied. The group then considered an  annex to the draft conclusions that sets out a preliminary list of  basic elements for national systems under Protocol Article 5.1  (national systems for GHG emissions and removals). JAPAN presented  an alternative draft of the annex, which he said aimed at greater  clarity. A smaller group will consider this matter and report to  the contact group at its next meeting.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Participants considered a draft text  compiling proposals by the EU, the G-77/CHINA and others. Chair El  Ghaouth (Mauritania) noted that he had undertaken informal  consultations and said the text did not intend to exclude country  positions. He highlighted non-Annex I communications as one of the  few agenda items that was a candidate for a COP-5 decision, and  adjourned the meeting to hold informal consultations.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Concern over perceived shortcomings of the GEF in delivering on  its role as an operating entity of the FCCC's financial mechanism  once again reverberated in the Maritim corridors. A number of  participants criticized the rigid eligibility criteria by which  the GEF interprets and weights proposals submitted by countries as  unrealistic, and said these criteria can delay the process of  implementing national actions. While some felt that the problems  arise from inadequate guidance given to the GEF by the COP, others  attributed them to difficulties in co-ordinating the interests and  mandates of two intergovernmental bodies. In response to these  concerns, a number of participants called for a country-led review  of the GEF's role so as to facilitate implementation of the FCCC,  particularly by the least developed countries.
