# SBSTA

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

On Article 6, MALAYSIA and CHINA stressed the  importance of a concrete implementation work programme. The US  suggested that a workshop be held on the prioritization of  activities and on setting a work programme. SENEGAL and CENTRAL  AFRICAN REPUBLIC called for a Climate Change Day. CHINA suggested  that each Party should focus on promoting public awareness on the  IPCC TAR, and MAURITIUS said Article 6 implementation should take  place at the grassroots level in both developed and developing  countries. The IUCN offered to contribute to carrying out the  necessary work through its Commission on Education and  Communication, a global network of experts. Chair Dovland said  Parties were clearly calling for more action and noted that  informal consultations would be held on the elaboration of draft  conclusions.

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY

On the fifth synthesis report of  AIJ under the pilot phase, the US provided proposals aimed at  capturing the ongoing review of the pilot phase through continuing  annual reports, revisiting elements for improvements, and looking  at host party experiences of the pilot phase. He suggested that a  decision for long-term review be made at the current COP,  recommending that Parties submit comments by March 2002. Chair  Dovland said informal consultations would be held.

### OTHER MATTERS

CANADA reported on a recent meeting in Calgary on  the 'cleaner or less greenhouse-gas-emitting energy trade,'  highlighting, inter alia, conclusions that: optimal uptake of  cleaner or less greenhouse-gas-emitting energy depends not only on  domestic emissions reduction strategies, but also on international  trade; and that such trade under the Protocol could encounter  significant barriers limiting emissions reduction opportunities  and could even lead to increased emissions. Supported by many  other Parties, he proposed a follow-up workshop on methodological  issues. Chair Dovland referred the matter to informal  consultations.

On UNFCCC Article 4.6 (flexibility for EITs), CROATIA stressed the  importance of utilizing this Article. Chair Dovland suggested that  SBSTA-16 consider this issue, that Parties views could be sent to  the Secretariat by 1 February 2002, and that the Secretariat  undertake a review of Croatia's national communication.

On a previous COP decision on the relationship between efforts to  protect the stratospheric ozone layer and efforts to safeguard the  global climate system, the EU suggested it should be a substantive  agenda item at SBSTA-16. Chair Dovland said he would prepare draft  conclusions.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

This group took up the draft  guidelines for the preparation of the information required under  Article 7. On the reporting of supplementary information under  Article 7.2  (inclusion of supplementary information in national  communications), delegates disagreed over whether Parties should  be 'required' or 'requested' to provide information on the use of  mechanisms to supplement domestic action. The matter will be  referred to the COP.

Regarding the paragraph on general information to be reported for  activities under Protocol Article 3.3 (afforestation,  deforestation, reforestation) and 3.4 (additional activities),  AUSTRALIA, supported by the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION and EU, cautioned that in many instances the  guideline text is more detailed than that contained in the draft  decision on LULUCF from COP-6 Part II. He stressed that details  should be left to be defined in the IPCC good practice guidance.  SAUDI ARABIA proposed introducing additional subparagraphs  requiring Parties to submit information on, inter alia, how the  reported activities exclude carbon dioxide removals due to  indirect human-induced effects. TUVALU stressed the need to  reflect the Bonn Agreements, and not 'pick and choose' what to  retain in the guidelines. A drafting group on the guideline  paragraphs dealing with LULUCF will be convened.

Delegates then turned to the issue of thresholds for non- compliance/mechanisms eligibility. The Secretariat presented an  analysis on the matter based on Parties' national communications  submitted in 2000/2001. He noted that the thresholds proposed in  the draft would ensure that major source categories and the sums  of many small adjustments are not omitted. Delegates responded  positively, and expressed the hope that the text could be cleared  of brackets on Thursday.

On the draft COP/MOP-1 decision on Article 7 guidelines, Chair  Dovland proposed that the chapeau related to the subparagraphs on  non-compliance/mechanisms eligibility be considered in a drafting  group. Delegates then approved an EU proposal related to timing of  review of national systems, and agreed on the paragraphs on  financial resources in the section relating to reporting of  supplementary information under Article 7.2.

### COMPLIANCE

Delegates resumed consideration of the Co-Chairs' non- paper on the status of negotiation, referring the majority of  unresolved issues to a drafting group. On the facilitative branch,  JAPAN put forward a proposal intended to reflect the language in  the Bonn Agreements on the type of questions of implementation to  be addressed. The G-77/CHINA said the proposal required further  clarification. On the enforcement branch, delegates discussed the  need to specify which commitment under Protocol Article 7.4  (establishment of guidelines and modalities for the accounting of  assigned amounts) would fall within its mandate.

On submissions, AUSTRALIA, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and  opposed by a number of Parties, suggested the deletion of the  possibility for a Party to submit a question of implementation  with respect to another Party, explaining that it had the  potential to create rifts among Parties or could eventually be  used for 'other reasons,' and that the reports from expert review  teams (ERTs) provided a thorough triggering process. The EU  highlighted that the Party-to-Party triggering option was useful  for the effectiveness and balance of the compliance procedures.  With IRAN, he said that if questions could be indicated in the  reports of ERTs, sovereign states should also have the possibility  to make submissions against another Party. SAMOA stressed that  procedures are non-adversarial, multilateral in nature and include  due-process provisions.  JAPAN, opposed by CHINA, suggested that  triggering against another Party could be limited to the  facilitative branch. Co-Chair Dovland said this issue was not of a  drafting nature and would thus be forwarded to the Plenary.

On general procedures, the G-77/CHINA suggested that the ERT  reports not be made publicly available before the Party concerned  had the opportunity to respond in writing to the relevant branch.  The RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested that the information considered  by the branch be made available to the public after the conclusion  of the process. SWITZERLAND and NORWAY highlighted the existence  of due process provisions in, and the need to be consistent with,  the text on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.

On the procedures for the enforcement branch, the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION, opposed by the EU, suggested text reflecting the right  for the Party concerned to have a closed hearing. SAMOA expressed  concern about upsetting the balance between access to information,  transparency and public participation, and safeguarding the  sovereign rights of the Party.

On expedited procedures, JAPAN said it would submit a proposal on  the procedure for reinstalling mechanisms' eligibility. On  consequences applied by the facilitative branch, the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, called for the deletion of  text requiring that UNFCCC Article 4.3 (financial resources), 4.4  (costs of adaptation), 4.5 (technology transfer) and 4.7  (conditionality in the fulfillment of commitments) be taken into  account.

On consequences applied by the enforcement branch, JAPAN, opposed  by the EU, proposed deleting the paragraphs providing for  consequences in case of non-compliance with Protocol Articles 5.1  (national systems), 5.2 (adjustments), 7.1 (annual inventories)  and 7.4 (establishment of guidelines and modalities for the  accounting of assigned amounts).

# INFORMAL GROUPS

### CGE

The informal contact group on the Consultative Group of  Experts (CGE) on national communications of non-Annex I Parties,  chaired by Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya), considered the revision of  guidelines for the preparation of national communications and  terms of reference for the CGE, and NAPAs from LDCs. Divergent  views between Parties resulted in Chair Ojoo-Massawa proposing to  draft text on the issues and reconvene the group on Thursday.

### CDM

Informal consultations on the CDM were held in the afternoon  chaired by Jos√© Miguez (Brazil). Delegates considered project  design of the CDM, focusing on the issues of validation,  monitoring, and accreditation, with some progress reported on the  draft texts. Informal meetings resumed late Wednesday evening on  various technical issues.

### JOINT IMPLEMENTATION

The informal group on joint implementation  reportedly made some progress on technical details of draft text  on JI in a meeting held late afternoon.

### LATE PAYMENTS

Philip Weech (The Bahamas) chaired informal  consultations on possible options to respond to late payment of  contributions. The group considered the text outstanding from SB- 12, including problems and inconveniences that could be faced by  the UNFCCC as a result of late payments to the core budget, and  additional options the SBI may wish to consider as a basis for  recommendations to the COP. The text was deferred for further  informal discussions on Thursday afternoon.

### PARTIES' STATUS UNDER THE CONVENTION

These informal  consultations, chaired by John Ashe, addressed a letter from the  Central Asia, Caucasus and Moldova Group of Parties on their  status under the UNFCCC. Participants considered a proposal from  relevant Parties seeking a clear definition of the term  'developing countries' as used by the UNFCCC. Following concerns  expressed by the G-77/CHINA, Chair Ashe suggested deferring  consideration of this issue to SB-16 and COP-8. Further informal  consultations may take place Thursday.

### LDCS

The informal group on matters relating to LDCs met in the  evening to begin discussions on NAPA guidelines, the LDC Expert  Group, and guidance on the LDC Fund. MALAWI introduced a new  proposal containing guidelines for preparing NAPAs, which  delegates then examined.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

A number of participants have been commenting on the considerable  workload at COP-7, pointing to the numerous issues taken up by the  subsidiary bodies and the many informal groups formed to address  them, all of which is additional to the remaining work of the  negotiating groups on the various draft decisions under the Bonn  Agreements. While some seemed concerned at the lost opportunity to  make significant progress on subsidiary body matters, others said  work under the Bonn Agreements must be the priority, especially  given the lack of progress so far in the negotiating groups.

In other news, rumors were circulating late Wednesday that work  was being undertaken on a Marrakesh Declaration for consideration  at next year's World Summit on Sustainable Development in  Johannesburg. Meanwhile, some delegates were expressing confusion  and concerns over the process for deciding the composition of the  CDM Executive Board.
