# SBSTA

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES: LULUCF Good Practice Guidance:

Chair  Thorgeirsson introduced the agenda item on the development of good  practice guidance and other information for LULUCF.  Reporting on  its LULUCF work programme, the IPCC noted a recent task force  meeting and its work plan for the upcoming year.

The FAO reported conclusions from an expert meeting held in  January on harmonizing forest-related definitions for use by  various stakeholders, jointly organized with the IPCC, the Center  for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), and the International  Union for Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO).  He reported four  key messages from the workshop: the importance of universally- accepted definitions; the need to approve and adopt existing  definitions before creating new ones; the general compatibility of  the FAO's definitions with Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4 (LULUCF);  and the fact that some definitions are incompatible with land use  or the state of forests. The EU supported the use of biome- specific forest definitions. The US cautioned against creating  separate definitions and urged coordination between different  reporting bodies. Chair Thorgeirsson indicated that he would  prepare draft conclusions by13 June, in consultation with  interested Parties.

###     LULUCF Activities under the CDM:

Chair Thorgeirsson said COP-7 had  asked SBSTA to develop, for adoption at COP-9, definitions and  modalities for including afforestation and reforestation  activities under the CDM in the first commitment period,  considering: non-permanence; additionality; leakage;  uncertainties; socio-economic and environmental impacts; and the  Principles guiding LULUCF as agreed at COP-7. The Secretariat  highlighted a workshop held from 7-9 April in Orviento, Italy,  which provided draft terms of reference and a work agenda for  LULUCF under the CDM (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/4) as well as country  submissions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.1 and Add.1-2).

The EU stressed that SB-16 should agree on future work and  encouraged delegates to agree on definitions. With UGANDA and  NORWAY, he supported basing definitions on those agreed for  Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4. The US noted the need for  consistency between the work of SBSTA and the CDM Executive Board.  JAPAN stressed consideration of host country conditions. UGANDA,  with NORWAY, stressed including agroforestry. BURKINA FASO and  MOROCCO said all countries should be eligible for participation. A  contact group was convened co-chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany)  and Thelma Krug (Brazil).

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Chair Thorgeirsson drew attention to Parties'  recent submissions on a proposal for a technology transfer  clearinghouse and information network, and on other relevant  matters (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.12). He also took note of two  workshops requested by SB-15 and held in April on technology  information (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.6) and on methodologies for  technology needs assessments (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.7).

Jukka Uosukainen (Finland), Chair of the UNFCCC Expert Group on  Technology Transfer (EGTT), briefed delegates on the Group's  activities since its establishment by COP-7 (decision 4/CP.7). He  noted that a preliminary meeting had taken place in April,  followed by the first formal meeting on 3 June. Discussions had  focused on the work programme and rules of procedure, with further  discussions scheduled for 8 June. He noted the formation of three  sub-groups to further the EGTT's work, and urged Parties to make  use of the technology information clearinghouse, TT:CLEAR.

The EU proposed reassessing some fundamentals of the  clearinghouse, including the targeting of recipients and their  needs. The US supported an open, inclusive and transparent process  for the EGTT. Participants agreed to convene for informal  consultations to develop draft conclusions for SBSTA.

###     POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms):

Chair Thorgeirsson highlighted the  COP-7 decision that SB-16 should consider further action to  advance work on 'good practices' in P&Ms, as well as the report of  a workshop on P&Ms held in Copenhagen in October 2001  (FCCC/SBSTA/2001/INF.5). He drew attention to Parties' recent  submissions on possible further actions, which were compiled by  the Secretariat in April (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.7).

Several Parties highlighted the importance of national  circumstances in determining appropriate P&Ms. The EU called for a  work programme to ensure proper implementation of Protocol Article  2.1(b) (cooperation on P&Ms). SAMOA, on behalf of AOSIS, called  for a work plan that includes a third workshop to be held in  October 2002. CANADA drew attention to its recent discussion paper  outlining various options for P&Ms. The US supported sharing  information on evaluation techniques for selecting appropriate  P&Ms. SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted the need to  minimize the impact of Annex I Parties' P&Ms on developing  countries, while observing that it had yet to develop a position  on the compilation document. AUSTRALIA supported taking stock of  the information provided during the recent workshops so as to  evaluate where SBSTA can 'add value.' A contact group was formed  to consider the matter further.

### INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

Chair Thorgeirsson noted the interim  report on the adequacy of the global climate observing systems  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.10), a progress report on the work of the  Joint Liaison Group of the UNFCCC, the CBD, and the UNCCD  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/3), and the submissions from Parties on  cooperation with intergovernmental bodies (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.9  and Add.1).

On cooperation with scientific organizations, Parties were briefed  by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) secretariat on the  adequacy of observing systems. Parties concurred on the importance  of implementing the ten UNFCCC climate monitoring principals  adopted at COP-5, and on the need for funding observation systems  in developing countries. CANADA, with MALAYSIA and AUSTRALIA,  advocated discussing climate change research in addition to  systematic observation. An informal contact group was convened for  further discussion on guidance to GCOS. On cooperation with UN  bodies, Parties were briefed by the IUCN, UNEP and FAO on their  activities relating to climate change. On cooperation with other  conventions, Parties were briefed by representatives of the CBD  and UNCCD.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

Co-Chair Luboyera opened the discussion on an  expedited review procedure for reinstatement of eligibility to use  the mechanisms. Delegates considered draft text, which  incorporated Party submissions, to be included in the guidelines  under Article 8. Under General Procedure, NEW ZEALAND emphasized  language expressing the need for Parties to provide additional  information. The EU stressed integration with the ordinary review  process, while NEW ZEALAND underscored the review for  reinstatement as a specific element of the review guidelines. A  small group was convened to resolve this issue. Delegates  discussed expert review teams (ERTs) appointed to conduct reviews  for reinstatement of eligibility, which they agreed would consist  of new experts or the same ones carrying out the regular review.  After delegates had considered Scope of Review, the Secretariat  distributed a Working Paper on demonstrable process under Protocol  Article 3.2, and the meeting was adjourned.

### GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES

A contact group on national greenhouse  gas inventories, co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton  Paciornik (Brazil), met to consider a Co-Chairs' proposed draft  Working Paper on guidelines for the preparation of national  communications by non-Annex I Parties that addresses UNFCCC  Reporting Guidelines on annual inventories. Parties deliberated on  proposals by the EU and US in the Co-Chairs' draft text. Agreement  was reached on a number of issues, including text relating to the  methodology, key source category determination, quality  assurance/quality control and recalculations. On uncertainties,  divergence emerged on text relating to reporting of 'each' source  and sink category. SWITZERLAND, supported by NEW ZEALAND, proposed  the wording 'key' categories to limit the consideration of numbers  of sources and sinks. Co-Chair Rosland said there would be further  consultations between the EU, US, NEW ZEALAND and SWITZERLAND to  be reported back to the contact group on Friday. A working group  on the common reporting format will also meet on Friday.

### LULUCF AND CDM

On definitions and modalities for including LULUCF  under the CDM, BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed that the  outcome of the Orvieto workshop held in April, which detailed  draft terms of reference (TOR) and agenda for work, served as a  basis for negotiation only. The EU, CANADA, JAPAN, URUGUAY, COSTA  RICA and NEW ZEALAND preferred using the Orvieto document as it  stands and stressed the tight work schedule leading to COP-9.  CHINA said workshop participation was limited and called for  further exchange of views. BRAZIL underscored links between  Articles 5, 7 and 8 and LULUCF modalities under the CDM.

Co-Chair Krug invited participants to comment on the TOR as  included in the annex of the workshop report. The G-77/CHINA noted  that some aspects are missing, and stressed the LULUCF guiding  Principles, particularly one on non-permanence. TUVALU, supported  by the G-77/CHINA and opposed by NEW ZEALAND and CANADA, proposed  including development of modalities for the application of the  Principles. Under the section on input, the G-77/CHINA proposed  that an options paper be compiled on modalities for crediting  LULUCF units under the CDM. CANADA stressed his understanding that  COP-7 decided that CDM projects generate CERs (certified emissions  reductions), not RMUs (removal units).

In the section on process, delegates agreed that SBSTA-16 would  prepare, but not yet adopt, conclusions on definitions, though  many Annex I Parties stressed the need to get as far ahead with  the work as possible during this session. On modalities, MALAYSIA  underscored the need to understand the issues before proceeding to  drafting. The EU noted that the TOR only called for starting  consideration of modalities at SB-17. Regarding the next workshop,  CHINA said it should focus on exchange of views, not negotiation.  MALAYSIA said agreement cannot be guaranteed at COP-9. Adjourning  the meeting, Co-Chair Krug said a new TOR and agenda of work,  taking Parties' views into consideration, would be prepared by the  Secretariat for Friday.

### INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION

Consultations were co-chaired by Sue  Barrell (Australia) and David Lesolle (Botswana). Following  discussions on capacity building needs with respect to climate  observing systems, the co-chairs adjourned the meeting to prepare  a draft decision that would provide further guidance to the GCOS  secretariat on its second report on the adequacy of global climate  observing systems. Further informal discussion will take place on  Friday.

### IPCC TAR

Co-Chair David Warrilow (UK) explained that the group's  aim was to prepare draft SBSTA conclusions and a draft COP-8  decision, focusing on how the IPCC TAR can help the SBSTA and  other UNFCCC bodies in their work. Delegates began by discussing  issues raised the previous day in SBSTA on which there appeared to  be widespread interest and support, including regional impacts and  adaptation, UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public  awareness), research, observations, and scientific uncertainty.  AUSTRALIA highlighted mitigation as another issue of wide  interest, while CHINA preferred a focus on adaptation. The GAMBIA  urged work on translating science into policy. On uncertainty,  several Parties affirmed that this was an important issue, while  adding that scientific knowledge continues to improve.

Parties expressed opinions on the question of 'stabilization to  avoid dangerous effects.' The contact group will continue its  deliberations on Friday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As SB-16's second day drew to a close, some participants seemed  surprised by the political undercurrent at the meeting. With many  delegations expecting talks to enter a more technical phase  following COP-7, a number of observers expressed disappointment at  the resurfacing of more controversial issues. One delegate noted a  'lack of trust' and suggested this could be the legacy of years of  turbulent and at times acrimonious discussions. However, others  felt a transition phase or 'post-Marrakesh blues' would inevitably  make its presence felt at this meeting.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY
