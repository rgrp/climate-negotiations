# SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

The SBI adopted its agenda and the list of  NGOs recommended to participate in its work as observers. On  election of officers, SBI Chair John Ashe said he and SBSTA Chair  Harald Dovland were undertaking consultations.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

On administrative and  financial matters, SBI first considered the financial performance  for 2000-2001. The Secretariat highlighted that a revised  indicative list of contributions was presented for 2001, pursuant  to the adoption by the UN General Assembly in 2000 of a revised  scale of assessment. He noted the special annual contribution of  DM 3.5 million made by the host government. CANADA, NORWAY, the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION and LATVIA expressed concern over the fact  that, contrary to indications contained in the document on the  status of contributions, they had taken the necessary steps to  make their 2001 contributions. The G-77/CHINA said the relevant UN  General Assembly resolution provides that the revised scale should  not automatically affect the scale of assessment of other UN  bodies. Chair Ashe said a draft decision would be prepared on this  issue.

On implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar noted the need to move an  increasing number of staff to temporary accommodation, as the  Secretariat continues to grow. An initial offer by the German  Government for part of the former Bundeshaus complex was deemed  insufficient to meet ongoing needs. However, he hoped the  situation would be resolved shortly. Some progress on visa and  other issues was also noted. GERMANY highlighted its commitment to  guarantee adequate accommodation and the best possible working  conditions for UN personnel. He said talks are ongoing to  accommodate all UN organizations in Bonn in a single location.

ARGENTINA expressed concern at these visa and accommodation  difficulties. He suggested a small committee might be established  to consider these issues, without being involved in micro- management. GERMANY said most difficulties have been addressed  during the past one and a half years, and undertook to take all  steps necessary to deal with problems as they arise. CANADA noted  Argentina's 'interesting' proposal but indicated some  reservations.

On the institutional linkage of the UNFCCC Secretariat to the UN,  the SBI agreed to recommend to the COP the adoption of a Note by  the Executive Secretary containing the recommendation that the UN  General Assembly and the COP approve the continuation of the  current institutional linkage, and related administrative  arrangements, for a further five-year period. On the juridical  personality of the Secretariat on the international plane, the  Secretariat noted that its UN linkage had enabled it to function  without it, and that it did have a juridical personality in  Germany. Chair Ashe said relevant draft conclusions would be  prepared.

Regarding the programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003,  Executive Secretary Cutajar outlined details of the proposed  programme budget. He noted that the formal adoption of the budget  is scheduled for COP-7. He said income would include indicative  contributions of US$27.5 million, in addition to the host  Government's contribution and carry-over from previous periods.  Delegates subsequently met in the afternoon in a small closed  group, chaired by John Ashe, to continue discussions on the  programme budget in greater detail.

### REPORTS ON INTER-SESSIONAL ACTIVITIES

On reports on inter- sessional activities, SBI considered the work of the Consultative  Group of Experts (CGE) on National Communications from Parties not  included in Annex I. In presenting the preliminary report of the  Group, Chair Vute Wangwacharakul (Thailand) said that, in an  examination of 50 national communications, the Group had  identified a number of problems that may be addressed, inter alia,  through the provision of adequate financial and technical  assistance. The G-77/CHINA said the recommendations of the CGE  were based only on a limited number of national communications,  and that a more comprehensive aggregate analysis was needed, while  the US said such recommendations should form the basis for the  development of new guidelines for national communications to be  adopted at COP-7. Chair Ashe said consultations on this issue,  facilitated by Philip Weech (The Bahamas), would take place later  during the day.

On ongoing activities on reporting and review of greenhouse gas  inventories in Annex I  Parties, the Secretariat said detailed  information on this issue would be provided during a side-event on  Wednesday. The US suggested a more comprehensive testing of the  guidelines by all Parties during the trial phase and that revised  guidelines be adopted at COP-8. Chair Ashe said SBSTA-15 will have  a substantive consideration of this agenda item.

# SBSTA

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Delegates adopted the SBSTA agenda. On the  election of officers, Chair Dovland noted that consultations are  ongoing.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

Chair  Dovland noted ongoing initiatives between the UNFCCC and the  Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), including: a CBD  discussion note and responses submitted by the UNFCCC Parties; a  CBD Ad Hoc Technical Expert Group to carry out a pilot assessment  on advice to integrate biodiversity into UNFCCC implementation;  and a proposed joint liaison group between the two Secretariats.  Jan Plesnik, Chair of the CBD Subsidiary Body on Scientific,  Technical and Technological Advice, reported on initiatives in the  CBD to address interlinkages between biodiversity and climate  change. Bob Watson, IPCC Chair, reported on the preparation of an  IPCC Technical Paper on linkages between climate and biodiversity.  The G-77/CHINA called for a joint CBD-UNFCCC programme to further  assess interlinkages. The EU emphasized developments with regard  to international environmental governance. With UGANDA, ZIMBABWE  and AUSTRALIA, he stressed cooperation with the Convention to  Combat Desertification and the UN Forum on Forests.

On the proposed joint liaison group, ZIMBABWE, with RWANDA and  JAPAN, said it should be equitably and geographically  representative. AUSTRALIA, with the US, questioned the  establishment of such a group, but welcomed informal coordination.  NORWAY supported screening LULUCF activities for biodiversity  according to 'agreed norms.' JAPAN called for caution with regard  to international norms, noting differences between national  circumstances. SENEGAL emphasized the link to poverty alleviation.  The FAO highlighted a December 2001 workshop on forest-related  definitions.

Chair Dovland said the Secretariats' coordinators would continue  to meet informally. He requested Colombia and Australia to  undertake informal consultations to formulate draft  conclusions/decisions, noting that much of the further work will  be referred to SBSTA-15.

On cooperation with scientific organizations, the EU took note of  the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) and its results 'that give  an additional sense of urgency' to further climate change work.  The Global Climate Observation System outlined a prospectus for  the preparation of a second assessment of the adequacy of the  global climate observing systems, and said that a further report  on the deficiencies of the observation systems would be provided  at COP-7.

### REPORTS ON INTER-SESSIONAL ACTIVITIES

On emissions resulting from  fuel used in international transportation, the Secretariat  highlighted inter-sessional work as contained in a joint report  with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the  International Maritime Organization. A discussion on this is  scheduled for SBSTA-15. The EU expressed concern about rising  emissions from air transportation and noted that ICAO is scheduled  to meet in September with a view to reaching decisions on this  question. The Secretariat reported on the workshop on methods and  tools to assess climate change impacts and adaptation. The EU  provided answers to the specific questions contained in the  workshop report.

On issues related to emissions from forest harvesting and wood  products, Chair Dovland said the topic would be referred to SBSTA- 15. New Zealand reported on a workshop for estimating and  accounting for carbon dioxide emissions from forest harvesting and  wood products, and said it is coordinating a further study. On  progress related to a technology information system, Chair Dovland  said the system is being regularly updated, and is taken up in the  consultative process on technology transfer.

On UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public awareness),  the EU, supported by many other Parties, outlined a proposal to  the SBSTA to consider further work. AUSTRALIA supported the  dissemination of the IPCC TAR results in a manner accessible to  the public.

### BRAZILIAN PROPOSAL

On Brazil's proposal on reductions toward an  overall emission ceiling for Annex I Parties allocated on the  basis of each Party's relative share of responsibility for climate  change, Chair Dovland said a workshop had been held to identify  scientific and methodological aspects of the proposal. The EU  noted progress in addressing the technical basis of the proposal,  but identified several outstanding issues. CHINA, supported by  BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA, warned that the work should not go  beyond the COP's mandate. The US noted the workshop's narrow  focus, called for consideration of other models and indicators,  and supported continued research. Chair Dovland said informal  consultations on draft conclusions would be undertaken.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

On 'best practices' in policies and  measures among Annex I Parties, Chair Dovland noted Party views  submitted on a proposed workshop's Terms of Reference (TOR), which  will be determined at the current SBSTA session. SAUDI ARABIA,  opposed by the G-77/CHINA, CG-11, the EU, AOSIS and others,  requested that the issue be deferred, as a decision regarding the  workshop had not been officially adopted at COP-6 Part I. Chair  Dovland said he would consult with President Pronk and said  informal consultations on the TOR would be facilitated by  Switzerland and Tanzania.

# PLENARY

In a late-afternoon Plenary, COP-6 President Pronk explained that  the remaining negotiations at the resumed COP-6 would be based on  The Hague text and the consolidated negotiating text (the 'Pronk  text'), while incorporating the political agreements reached by  the Ministers on Monday, 23 July. He proposed that the remaining  work be conducted in negotiating groups on finance, mechanisms,  LULUCF, compliance and Protocol Articles 5 (methodological  issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of  information). SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA, said that the work  on Articles 5, 7 and 8 should start only after the adoption of the  decisions on the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. President Pronk said  there would be daily meetings with the negotiating groups' Chairs  to provide clarity on the timing and structure of the remainder of  the session. He then suspended the meeting early at the request of  the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and UKRAINE, due to lack of interpretation  facilities.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Reality returned on Tuesday as controversy over Monday's political  decision dampened delegates' earlier exuberance. Behind the  scenes, concern surfaced over so-called 'technical' and  'editorial' changes made overnight Monday to the latest version of  the decision, with some participants suggesting that several  alterations had substantive/political implications. In the section  on mechanisms, the removal of a reference to the principles  guiding afforestation and reforestation projects under the CDM  reportedly made some delegates 'shudder.' There was also  controversy in this section over new language on the mechanisms'  eligibility requirement related to compliance. While some argued  that the change affected the possible future legal nature of  procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance, others said both  texts accommodate the possible adoption of either a decision or an  amendment on such procedures and mechanisms.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### PLENARY

Plenary is likely to meet in the morning to decide on the  organization of work for the remainder of the week, and is  expected to formally adopt the decision on Pronk's 'core elements'  text. See the Notice board for further details.
