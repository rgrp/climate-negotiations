# COP PLENARY

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

COP-8 Vice-President Enele Sopoaga  (Tuvalu) opened the session.

Speaking for COP-8 President T.R. Baalu, C. Viswanath, India's  Joint Secretary for Environment and Forests, called on Annex I  Parties to take the lead in addressing the impacts of climate  change, provide developing countries with financial and  technological assistance, and rejected the introduction of  commitments for developing countries.

Vice-President Sopoaga then introduced Miklós Persányi, Minister  of Environment and Water, Hungary, who was elected COP-9 President  by acclamation.

President Persányi highlighted efforts in developing countries to  implement climate friendly production patterns. Although the  Protocol has not yet entered into force, he said its ratification  by numerous Parties demonstrates its importance.

Altero Matteoli, Italy's Minister for the Environment and  Territory, stressed that COP-9 provides an opportunity to identify  new and stronger initiatives for combating climate change.

Roberto Formigoni, President of the Region of Lombardy, stressed  the importance of regional action on climate change.

Gabriel Albertini, Mayor of Milan, said delegates must take long- term views of climate change, its impacts, and the well-being of  future generations.

Luigi Cocchiaro, for the President of the Province of Milan,  called for increasing implementation in the areas of transport and  renewable energy.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter said that, while the  date of the Protocol's entry into force remains uncertain, it is  encouraging that this has not slowed the momentum for action. She  emphasized the need to ensure that adequate resources are provided  to meet programme delivery and implementation of COP decisions,  and said it was essential that the budget discussions result in a  realistic match of demand and supply.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Adoption of the rules of procedure: The  COP agreed to apply the draft Rules of Procedure, except for Rule  42 (voting). President Persányi noted that he would consult with  Parties and report to COP-10 on adopting the Rules of Procedure in  their entirety.

###     Adoption of the agenda

President Persányi presented the agenda  for adoption (FCCC/CP/2003/1 and Add.1), noting that the COP-8  Bureau had recommended that the item on the second review of the  adequacy of commitments under UNFCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b) be  held in abeyance. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by OMAN and the EU, and  opposed by CANADA, requested the exclusion of a Canadian proposal  on modalities for the accounting of assigned amounts in relation  to cleaner energy exports.

Parties adopted the agenda with the items on the second review of  adequacy of commitments, the proposal by Canada on cleaner energy  exports, and matters relating to Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse  effects of policies and measures) held in abeyance. President  Persányi agreed to consult with Parties on these items.

### OPENING STATEMENTS

MOROCCO, for G-77/China, called on the Russian  Federation to ratify the Protocol and for the US to 'come back on  board,' and expressed concern about the low level of financial  contributions to the Secretariat.

ZIMBABWE, on behalf of the Africa Group, said Annex I Parties have  failed to assume leadership in reducing greenhouse gas emissions,  and lack political will to do so.

ITALY, for the EU, urged the US to take actions comparable to  those that would have been expected from them under the Protocol.

TUVALU, for AOSIS, said the discussion on afforestation and  reforestation under the CDM must maintain the social,  environmental and economic integrity of the mechanism.

PAKISTAN said work at COP-9 must focus on capacity building,  technology transfer, and the SCCF.

Highlighting the vulnerability of LDCs, TANZANIA, for the LDCs,  stressed the need for the entry into force of the Protocol and  constructive work on matters relating to technology transfer,  capacity building and LDCs.

# SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Adoption of the agenda: SBI Chair Daniela  Stoycheva (Bulgaria) opened the session, and introduced the agenda  for adoption (FCCC/SBI/2003/9 and Corr.1). Regarding the sub-item  on submission of second and third national communications, the  G-77/CHINA objected to the reference to the 'frequency of'  submissions, and, with SAUDI ARABIA, stressed the importance of  financial and technical support for preparing national  communications before addressing the issue of their timing.  Supporting the inclusion of the reference, the EU, with AUSTRALIA,  noted that decision 17/CP.8 (guidelines for the preparation on  non-Annex I national communications) refers to the 'frequency of'  submissions.

On the sub-item dealing with the consideration of the fifth  compilation and synthesis of initial national communications, the  G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, objected to a document tabled by  the Secretariat on steps taken by non-Annex I Parties to reduce  emissions.

Following a break for informal consultations on the two sub-items,  discussions continued in Plenary, with delegates agreeing to  delete reference to the document, and to hold the sub-item on the  frequency of submission in abeyance.

Delegates then discussed the agenda item addressing the  implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse affects).  The EU, with the US, emphasized the need to discuss the  implementation of decision 5/CP.7 as a sub-item. The G-77/CHINA,  and others, proposed that the agenda sub-item not be restricted to  decision 5/CP.7, but address all matters related to Article 4.8.  Following discussion, this sub-item was also held in abeyance, and  the agenda was adopted, as amended.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Consideration of the fifth  compilation and synthesis of initial national communications: The  EU, supported by JAPAN, requested a detailed compilation and  synthesis regarding all national communications to date.

###     Work of the CGE

The EU underlined the importance of maximum  participation in workshops. The US stressed the need for  transparent information, clear and realistic objectives, and an  efficient and flexible programme.

###     Provision of financial and technical support

The EU encouraged  Parties that have not initiated their national communications to  make full use of GEF support.

SBI agreed to convene a contact group on national communications,  chaired by S.N. Sok Appadu (Mauritius).

# SBSTA

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBSTA Chair Halldór Thorgeirsson (Iceland)  opened the session, and delegates adopted the agenda  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/11). On election of officers other than the  Chair, Chair Thorgeirsson said this would be considered in  conjunction with the election of COP-9 Bureau members.

### IPCC TAR

Introducing the Chair's summary of the pre-sessional  consultations, Chair Thorgeirsson said approaches to considering  the new agenda items include: enhancing information exchange and  experiences; identifying gaps in data and information; and  providing policy-relevant analyses. He outlined solutions and  opportunities in which adaptation and mitigation can contribute to  sustainable development. MALAYSIA, for the G-77/China, expressed  hope that the new agenda items will not introduce new commitments  for developing country Parties, and emphasized that SBSTA should  not focus on long-term planning of adaptation and mitigation  issues given the urgency of adaptation needs.

The EU said SBSTA should use a wide range of approaches and  methodologies, including case-studies, technical papers, and  workshops, and draw on activities being developed by stakeholders.  JAPAN said the process should be based on a stepwise practical  approach. NORWAY noted the level of convergence and optimism in  the pre-sessional consultations and, with NEW ZEALAND, stressed  the importance of keeping a balance between bottom-up and top-down  approaches.

SAUDI ARABIA stressed that SBSTA not go beyond its mandate, and  stay within the context of UNFCCC Article 4 (commitments). The US  expressed concern over dividing the consideration of adaptation  and mitigation into solutions and opportunities to contribute to  sustainable development, and into long-term planning. SAUDI ARABIA  expressed concern over taking a broad view of the issue. SBSTA  agreed to convene a contact group on this issue.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Review of methodological work: AUSTRALIA  noted the value of the synthesis of views on a future work  programme on methodological work and, with the EU, stressed the  need for a data interface. The US highlighted the need to  prioritize important issues, and take into account capacity,  expertise, and financial considerations. SBSTA agreed to convene a  contact group to discuss these issues.

###     Greenhouse gas inventories

The IPCC outlined progress on the  revision of the Revised 1996 Guidelines for National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories, and the International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO) updated SBSTA on ICAO's work on aviation emissions.  ARGENTINA called for the identification of options to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation.

The EU noted the increase in emissions from international aviation  and maritime transportation by 48% in the past ten years, and  proposed that SBSTA work with ICAO to achieve further progress in  this area. TUVALU urged a more proactive role than information  gathering on emissions from aviation and maritime transportation  and requested the Chair to initiate a process for mitigating  emissions from this sector. JAPAN said revised methodologies  should be used by all Parties, and stressed the importance of  equity in this regard. AUSTRALIA encouraged SBSTA to support  programmes for improving maritime and aviation emissions  estimates, and supported a comparison of aviation fuel and  emissions data with ICAO models.

Chair Thorgeirsson requested Helen Plume (New Zealand) to conduct  informal consultations on the matter, and said the issue would be  taken up by SBSTA on Tuesday, 9 December.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### IPCC TAR

The contact group, chaired by SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson,  met in the evening to discuss the overall task under the two  agenda items, specific next steps for SBSTA-20, and a draft COP  decision. The EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, suggested developing a  practical, longer-term work programme. CHINA and AUSTRALIA called  for a focus on practical steps, and AUSTRALIA, with NORWAY,  proposed convening round-tables at SBSTA-20. CANADA, the US and  JAPAN, emphasized the importance of information exchange. NEW  ZEALAND, supported by the G-77/CHINA, suggested establishing a  clearing house. CANADA proposed developing a COP decision on the  basis of the Chair's Summary of the pre-sessional consultations.  Chair Thorgeirsson said he would prepare draft SBSTA conclusions  and a COP decision on the basis of Parties' suggestions.

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The group decided to request the CGE  Chair to present the CGE work programme at the next contact group  meeting on Wednesday, 3 December.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With the issue of the second commitment period simmering under the  surface, the opening COP and SBI plenaries were full of lengthy  discussions on issues likely to dominate the COP agenda over the  next two weeks. As in the past, the inclusion of the second review  of adequacy of commitments remains controversial, and the item was  held in abeyance for the fifth year running. The adoption of the  agenda in SBI took much longer, with discussions focusing on a  Secretariat document that highlights mitigation measures by  developing countries. One delegate observed that the insistence by  developing countries to oppose the recognition of the document is  ironic as it puts into question one of the reasons the US rejected  the Protocol. Others suggested that the Secretariat's document  could have provided some 'ammunition' to increase financial and  technical assistance for developing countries, while reinforcing  the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, and  providing an opportunity for the US to come back on board.
