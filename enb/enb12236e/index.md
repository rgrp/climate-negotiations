# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

This contact group was chaired by Markus Nauser  (Switzerland), who encouraged Parties to provide guidance to the  Secretariat for elaboration of the clearing house on Article 6  activities. The Secretariat presented the UNFCCC information  network Internet site containing a small-scale model of the  clearing house (http://test.unfccc.int/). Parties then discussed  the target audience of the clearing house, focus areas for the  first phase of work, and nodes for supplying and maintaining the  information on the site. The G-77/CHINA stressed the need to  assist Parties who do not have national sites. The EU and NAMIBIA  suggested that the first phase of work should target Parties.  Several Parties supported regional and sub-regional nodes for  supplying and maintaining information. The US encouraged the  involvement of existing institutions to fulfill these roles.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This contact group  was chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany). Participants agreed that as  views on the inclusion of the second review of adequacy of  commitments under UNFCCC Article 4.2 (a) and (b) were well known,  Chair Sach would ask the Secretariat to take note of the SBI  Plenary discussion on Thursday, 17 June, including on the footnote  suggested by the G-77/China. Regarding arrangements for COP-10,  delegates discussed the possible timing, structure and themes of  the high-level segment. ARGENTINA and SWITZERLAND said the themes  should appeal to ministers and delegates. Parties discussed the  proposed theme on energy and climate change, with SAUDI ARABIA  cautioning against focusing on any single energy sector.

On organization of the intergovernmental process, delegates  discussed the timing of a suggested workshop, with several Parties  stressing the importance of such a workshop. On effective  participation in the UNFCCC process, the EU and JAPAN presented  views on options listed by the Secretariat to promote  participation by NGOs and indigenous peoples. Chair Sach said the  issue of observer status to the CDM EB was regulated by an  existing COP decision (decision 21/CP.8 on the CDM EB).

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This contact group was chaired by Dechen  Tsering (Bhutan), who listed possible elements for draft  conclusions, which will be made available to participants before  the next contact group meeting. She invited participants to  suggest elements for a draft COP decision. Discussions centered  on, inter alia: synergies with other Rio conventions; elements of  the technical paper on the range and effectiveness of capacity  building, including indicators for capacity-building projects; and  the relevance of National Capacity Self Assessments in assessing  capacity needs for climate change.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

This contact group was  co-chaired by Paul Watkinson (France) and Mohamed Mahmoud Ould El  Ghaouth (Mauritania). Co-Chair Watkinson said the negotiation text  forwarded from SBI-19 would form the basis of discussions. KENYA,  for the G-77/China, suggested re-organizing the document under  sub-headings, and circulated text with proposed changes and  additions. Several Parties, including the EU and US, supported  the suggestion for re-organizing the text, with the US also  circulating a proposal.

Delegates worked to remove brackets, and presented changes and  additions on, inter alia: a synthesis document on submissions on  activities to meet the specific needs and circumstances of  developing country Parties arising from the adverse effects of  climate change and response measures; a call for submissions of  views on insurance and risk measures; regional workshops; and  mobilization of technical and financial resources. Co-Chair  Watkinson invited delegates to review and consult on the new  proposals before the next contact group meeting.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The contact group considered draft  conclusions. On text regarding the results of the TT:CLEAR survey,  the EU, with JAPAN and CANADA, opposed referring to specific  results and suggested noting the survey generally instead. GHANA,  for the G-77/China, supported by UGANDA, favored retaining the  original language reflecting that the Internet site is lightly  used by non-Annex I Parties. CHINA, supported by G-77/CHINA,  suggested referring to figures on the site's usage in the draft  conclusions. The US, supported by the EU and CANADA, and opposed  by the G-77/CHINA, proposed noting the survey and its useful  feedback and recommendations, including the concern that the site  is lightly used by non-Annex I Parties. Discussion on this  paragraph was suspended. On text regarding the workshop on  innovative financing, THAILAND, supported by the G-77/CHINA, and  opposed by the US, EU, CANADA, SWITZERLAND and JAPAN, suggested  calling on the workshop to generate concrete proposals on funding  mechanisms under UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology transfer). The US,  CANADA and SWITZERLAND said the proposed wording is restrictive.  Co-Chair Andrej Kranjc invited interested Parties to consult  informally on the matter.

### LULUCF GPG

On definitions and methodological issues relating to  degradation of forests, devegetation and other vegetation types,  AUSTRALIA and others supported discussing the matter within a  broader dialogue on second commitments. TUVALU, with BRAZIL,  suggested an on-going discussion on the matter. On factoring out,  AUSTRALIA circulated text calling for a forward-looking dialogue  that takes a broad approach to LULUCF issues. The US, CANADA,  JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND supported this comprehensive approach. The  EU, TUVALU and BRAZIL preferred a focused approach and suggested  holding a technical workshop after COP-10, which would consider  submissions by Parties and possibly deal with devegetation and  degradation. Co-Chair William Kojo Agymang-Bonsu said the  Co-Chairs would draft new text. Parties also discussed draft  conclusions on harvested wood products.

# SBSTA IN-SESSION WORKSHOP

SBSTA Chair Benrageb chaired the workshop.

### SESSION 1: HOW CAN CLIMATE CHANGE RISK BE ASSESSED?

Introducing  the topic, Zbigniew Kundzewicz, Polish Academy of Sciences,  defined the concepts of vulnerability, risk, and adaptation to  climate change. He noted the increasing rate of temperature rise  and the resulting aggregate adverse impacts.

Roger Jones, Atmospheric Research, Commonwealth Scientific and  Industrial Research Organization, Australia, spoke on the  suitability of risk assessment to inform adaptation needs, and  called for focused assessment of the adaptive potential of  different activities.

Mahendra Shah, International Institute for Applied System Analysis,  presented on climate change impacts on agriculture. He highlighted  severe impacts in Southern Africa, drawing attention to inequity  of impacts among countries.

Xuedu Lu, Ministry of Science and Technology, China, presented on  methodologies for impact studies on climate change in China. He  noted the number of uncertainties resulting from models and  methods, and called on SBSTA to promote research and development  of assessment tools in developing countries.

Dagmar Schr√∂ter, Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research,  reported on methods to assess European vulnerability to climate  change and shared preliminary results, noting that by 2050,  overall consequences of climate change in Europe will be adverse.  She highlighted the importance of science-policy dialogues.

In the ensuing discussion, participants addressed, inter alia,  issues of spatial and temporal scale, uncertainties as an  intrinsic part of scientific progress, the lack of insurance  mechanisms in SIDS, and risk perceptions.

### SESSION 2: HOW IS CLIMATE CHANGE RISK PERCEIVED?

Donald Lemmen,  Natural Resources Canada, said risk perception and adaptive  capacity vary. He noted that vulnerability to current climate at  the local and regional level, and the engagement of decision  makers are central to raising risk awareness.

Lourdes Tibig, Philippine Atomspheric, Geophysical and  Astronomical Services Administration, said floods, tropical  cyclones, storm surges, monsoon rains and droughts are primary  risks to the Philippines. She outlined the risks of climate change  to agriculture, food and health sectors, and coastal and water  resources.

Antonio Queface, Eduardo Mondlane University, Mozambique,  described Mozambique's vulnerability to tropical cyclones, floods  and droughts, which are aggravated by the country's geographical  location, limited ability to forecast extreme events, reduced  capability to adapt to natural disasters, and high climate  variability.

In the discussion, TUVALU asked if a group of risk insurance  experts could advance the UNFCCC process. He also asked how models  for risk assessment could be rendered meaningful at the local  level. Lemmen suggested focusing on areas with highest  vulnerability. NIUE asked how resilience could be increased.  Lemmen responded that lessons could be learnt from the process of  building resilience.

### SESSION 3: ADAPTATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Saleemul Huq,  International Institute for Environment and Development, UK, said  adaptation planning should be based on existing knowledge, and  stressed the importance of the development community in this  respect.

Shardul Agrawala, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development, said adaptation is not always synergistic with  development processes, but noted that adaptive processes are  already taking place in various sectors. He stressed that new  plans cannot be effectively implemented if there is a poor track  record for implementing past plans.

Mohamed El-Raey, University of Alexandria, Egypt, spoke on  adaptation measures in Egypt. He highlighted the importance of  anticipatory and specific adaptation.

Ko Barret, US Agency for International Development, described her  organization's efforts to incorporate awareness of climate-related  risks into projects. She noted that the aim is to raise awareness  among project managers that incorporating adaptation concerns  ensures project resilience in the long run.

In the discussion, SAUDI ARABIA urged addressing adaptation to  response measures. TUVALU said that lack of institutional capacity  could affect implementation of adaptation plans. UGANDA recalled  that projects are dependent on funding, and noted that many  countries are currently unable to carry out adaptation due to lack  of funding. Huq said progress on this matter should be evident  shortly. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK called for new and additional  funds for adaptation, and pointed to synergies on adaptation among  stakeholders, institutions and processes.

### SESSION 4: SOLUTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Anthony Nyong, University  of Jos, Nigeria, presented on adapting to droughts among rural  households in semi-arid Nigeria. He said local stakeholders' views  must be considered to develop successful adaptation measures.

    Nagmeldin Elhassan, Higher Council for Environment and Natural  Resources, Sudan, shared lessons on adaptation from Sudan. He  stressed that action on adaptive capacity building and enhancement  of coping capacity are necessary to reduce vulnerability.

Ahsan Ahmed, Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad Centre for Water and  Environment, spoke on lessons learned on adaptation in Bangladesh.  He emphasized that projects should aim to: encourage communities  to identify the causes of their vulnerability; include field-level  discussions on indigenous solutions; target intervention at  different levels of governance; and aim for long-term solutions.

Carmenza Robledo, Intercooperation, Switzerland, spoke on  community management of natural resources as an instrument to  increase resilience. She described a review of twelve  Intercooperation community initiatives, concluding that increasing  adaptive capacity requires developing institutional frameworks at  national and sub-national levels and methodologies at the local  level.

Serge Planton, M√©t√©o France, spoke on adaptation to the 2003 heat  wave in France. He stressed that adapting to heat waves requires  combining different levels of decision making with national  coordination.

In the discussion, CUBA asked if forecasting could have prevented  the heat-wave impacts. Planton explained that there had been lack  of communication between institutions. The INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY  FOR DISASTER REDUCTION drew parallels between adaptation and  disaster management.

### CONCLUSIONS

Chair Benrageb said conclusions of the workshop will  be presented to SBSTA on Monday, 21 June.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

High-level attendance in the contact group on arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings and spirited discussion on the format  of the high-level segment led to speculation on the importance  placed by governments on attracting a star cast of heads of State  and ministers to the tenth anniversary of the UNFCCC. Meanwhile,  several delegates commented on the success of the in-session  workshop on adaptation.
