# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### CAPACITY BUILDING

On Saturday, Parties considered the Chair's  revised draft conclusions containing a draft COP decision.  Delegates addressed remaining bracketed text, but were unable to  agree on whether to hold a workshop to facilitate an exchange of  views and experience on the implementation of decision 2/CP.7  (capacity building in developing countries). The G-77/CHINA,  opposed by the EU and JAPAN, supported holding the workshop.  Following a break to allow for informal consultations, delegates  agreed to Chair Dechen Tsering's proposal that she would consult  informally with Parties to reach agreement and forward clean text  to the SBI.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR 2004-5

On Saturday, Chair John Ashe  presented a draft COP decision. SOUTH AFRICA expressed concern  that measures to facilitate a prompt start to the CDM would be  financed from voluntary funds. She requested a footnote, which  states that several components would be funded from the core  budget, while the remainder would come from the supplemental Trust  Fund. NORWAY supported a 9% budget increase, while JAPAN  reaffirmed its position to support a zero growth budget and to  move the interim allocation from the core budget to the  supplemental Trust Fund. The EU and NEW ZEALAND said Protocol  development activities should remain in the core budget.  Responding to a US suggestion to develop separate scales and  budgets for the Protocol and UNFCCC, Chair Ashe proposed  developing such an approach to be funded by Parties to the  Protocol starting in January 2004.

On Monday night, Chair Ashe distributed a revised draft COP  decision. Deliberations continued into the night, with Parties  agreeing to a 6% budget increase, and to keep the Protocol  development activities in the core budget.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

On Saturday, Parties  considered the Chair's revised draft conclusions and a draft COP  decision. On provision of financial and technical support for the  submission of views on experiences with the GEF and its  implementing agencies, the EU questioned the regularity of such  submissions. Parties addressed text to be forwarded for  consideration in the omnibus decision under the agenda item on  additional guidance to the GEF, and agreed to consult informally  on the paragraphs and submit views to the Secretariat. On timing  of submissions of second and, where appropriate, third national  communications, the US and SAINT LUCIA questioned the meaning of  'availability of financial resources.' The G-77/CHINA noted that  the preparation of national communications is a continuous  process, but that the frequency of submissions is a 'non-issue.'  Chair Sok Appadu requested submission of views from Parties for  the preparation of a draft decision for discussion on Monday.

On Monday, the G-77/CHINA suggested deleting text on recognizing  that the submission of national communications would ensure that  the COP has sufficient information to assess the UNFCCC's  implementation in a timely manner. The EU proposed text that  national communications assist the COP to review the UNFCCC's  implementation. The G-77/CHINA objected, and said the Group would  consult on this matter internally. The US proposed additional text  that non-Annex I Parties should submit national greenhouse gas  inventories every two years, with LDCs submitting their  inventories with their national communications.

### SCCF

On Saturday, the Co-Chairs presented a revised draft COP  decision. In preliminary comments, the G-77/CHINA addressed  concerns that the text, inter alia, had not incorporated elements  regarding the predictability, and new and additional nature of the  funding, and had excluded references to technology transfer as it  relates to adaptation. Noting that the text was a good basis for  negotiations, the EU and CANADA said several elements had not been  included in the revised text. Co-Chair Rawleston Moore then  suspended the contact group to allow for informal consultations.

On Monday, discussions continued in informal consultations.  Parties focused on operative paragraphs dealing with SCCF  principles and the definition of adaptation projects. A proposal  by a group of developed countries to include references to the  Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in an operative paragraph was  opposed by developing countries who insisted that such references  should only be addressed in the preambular text. Delegates could  not agree to a proposal by a developed country to use non-Annex I  national communications as the basis for defining adaptation and  technology transfer priorities.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

On Monday, the G-77/CHINA,  AUSTRALIA, US and EU expressed views on the Co-Chairs' draft COP  decision, with the G-77/CHINA noting that additions would be  necessary, and the US urging that the text not be expanded  further. Parties discussed the preambular paragraphs, debating  whether to include text from decision 5/CP.7. The EU suggested  text referring to meeting the requirements of sustainable  development. Opposed by the G-77/CHINA, the US and CANADA said  there is no need to emphasize specific aspects of decision 5/CP.7.  Delegates then addressed how to qualify progress made on the  implementation of decision 5/CP.7. Opposed by the G-77/CHINA,  AUSTRALIA suggested welcoming 'significant' progress in the  implementation of 5/CP.7. Parties discussed the nature and timing  of submissions on activities implemented to support the provisions  of decision 5/CP.7. The G-77/CHINA suggested that submissions  should contain information on support programmes to meet national  needs and specific circumstances of developing country Parties  arising from adverse effects of climate change. Parties discussed  how to address views on insurance. The EU, supported by the US,  suggested considering insurance and risk assessment, and removing  reference to a work programme on insurance. In the evening,  delegates addressed the remaining paragraphs in the draft decision  in informal consultations.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

On Saturday, Parties reviewed the Co-Chairs'  draft conclusions. GHANA and THAILAND recommended amending text on  support from international and other organizations. The US  suggested text noting the need to take account of the financial  resources that 'may be needed' for the implementation of the  EGTT's work programme, while THAILAND and GHANA supported text  stating that the EGTT 'requires' more resources. CANADA expressed  concern about prejudging financial needs. CHINA and MALAYSIA  recommended combining paragraphs on resource allocation and  requests for support to the EGTT. The G-77/CHINA introduced text  on enhancing: the 'push factor' in developed countries to transfer  technologies to developing countries; assessments on technology  transfer; and joint research on environmentally sound  technologies. The EU suggested text on reporting on capacity- building activities relating to technology transfer in national  communications. Deliberations continued in informal discussions.

### GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE ON LULUCF

On Saturday, delegates discussed  revised draft conclusions and a draft COP decision. TUVALU raised  concern over recommending the IPCC Good Practice Guidance (GPG)  without having had time for its full consideration. Opposing this,  the EU, with JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION urged adopting the GPG for both the UNFCCC and the  Protocol in order to prepare national inventories in time for  implementation.

Delegates discussed revised text on factoring out direct human- induced changes in carbon stocks from indirect and natural  effects. The G-77/CHINA proposed referring to the IPCC statement  to SBSTA when taking note of the IPCC report on factoring out. The  US, SWITZERLAND and NEW ZEALAND objected to this proposal.  Regarding the need to address accounting of LULUCF activities,  CANADA, supported by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, proposed  referring to the IPCC report. Opposing this proposal, the G-77/CHINA suggested referring to text in a draft COP/MOP decision  contained in decision 11/CP.7 (LULUCF) on changes in stocks from  natural effects. On Parties' submissions, the EU and AUSTRALIA,  opposed by NEW ZEALAND and TUVALU, suggested inviting submissions  on issues relating to LULUCF, other than on factoring out.

On Monday, Co-Chair Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe announced that  Parties had agreed to recommend the IPCC GPG for reporting under  the UNFCCC, and to further consider reporting requirements under  the Protocol at SBSTA-20, with a view to making a decision by COP- 10. On factoring out, Parties agreed to note the IPCC report  submitted to SBSTA by the IPCC in response to a COP invitation. On  accounting of LULUCF activities, Parties took note of an 'aim to  address the issues' referred to in the COP/MOP decision and to  discuss practical methodologies for factoring out. Regarding  Parties' submissions, delegates agreed to invite Parties to submit  their views on other, related LULUCF issues.

Parties approved the draft conclusions and decision on GPG and  harvested wood products, as amended.

### R&SO

On Saturday, Co-Chair Sue Barrell reported on informal  consultations, noting divergent views on providing additional  guidance to the GEF. She proposed compromise text, recalling the  conclusions of SBSTA-17 and inviting the SBI, in considering  additional guidance to the GEF, to give appropriate consideration  to addressing the priority needs identified in regional action  plans on global climate observing systems. Parties discussed under  which fund the GEF would consider observation activities, and  debated referring to SBI guidance to the 'financial mechanisms,'  'financial mechanism' or 'SCCF.' Stressing that this is for the  SBI to decide, NORWAY, with AUSTRALIA, CANADA and the EU,  supported a proposal by NEW ZEALAND to invite the SBI to give  appropriate consideration to the issue in considering funding  options. The G-77/CHINA objected to the proposal.

On Monday, Parties agreed to invite the SBI to give appropriate  consideration to addressing the priority needs identified in  regional action plans on global climate observing systems when  considering funding options, including in the SBI's additional  guidance to the GEF. Delegates approved the draft conclusions and  draft COP decision.

### SINKS IN THE CDM

On Saturday, Co-Chair Thelma Krug introduced a  revised draft COP decision and annex. The text: allows for  negative leakage only; includes an option for both temporary CERs  and long-term CERs; includes options for renewable and fixed  crediting periods; provides a definition for small-scale projects  with modalities to be decided at COP-10; maintains the agreed  definitions of forest, afforestation and reforestation; makes  reference to the first commitment period in the decision text,  rather than in the annex; provides for regulation of genetically  modified organisms and invasive alien species according to  national laws; incorporates socioeconomic and environmental  criteria into the project design document; and includes a general  reference to the IPCC GPG. On Monday, informal consultations  continued throughout the day and into the night.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

On Monday, delegates reviewed the Co- Chairs' revised draft decision. SAUDI ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA  said paragraphs on background information and on future  methodological work should be bracketed until the completion of  IPCC TAR discussions. Parties agreed to text on a data-interface  scoping phase, with minor amendments. Parties also agreed to  remove text on: periodic overviews of the status of methodological  work; collaboration with relevant organizations; and capacity  building relating to the development and dissemination of  methodologies. Parties debated whether to remove provisions on the  exchange of information regarding the implementation of national  systems for the preparation of national greenhouse gas  inventories, and on the exchange of information to increase common  understanding of proposals for determining Parties' contributions  to controlling emissions.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Over the weekend, several observers noted divergent views between  Annex I and non-Annex I Parties in the SCCF negotiations, with  disagreement surfacing on references to the MDGs and economic  diversification. Clearly, a 'take it or leave it' approach is  evident from both sides, that could jeopardize the  operationalization of the Fund at COP-9.

On another note, discussions on sinks in the CDM, which appeared  to be progressing last week, have suddenly come to an all-too- familiar halt over the size of small-scale projects.
