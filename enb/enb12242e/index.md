abstract: "The twentieth sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB-20) to the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) took place at the  Maritim Hotel in Bonn, Germany, from 16-25 June 2004. Approximately  1,350 participants from 161 governments, one observer State, and  134 intergovernmental, non-governmental and other observer  organizations and media outlets were in attendance. Throughout the  meeting, Parties convened in plenary sessions of the Subsidiary  Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the  Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI), as well as in several  contact groups and informal consultations. At SB-20, Parties  adopted numerous conclusions and forwarded draft decisions for  deliberation at COP-10. In particular, SBSTA considered  methodological issues, including: small-scale afforestation and  reforestation project activities under the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM); good practice guidance on land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF); greenhouse gas inventories;  emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime  transport; and issues relating to Protocol Articles 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information).  Parties also discussed scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to,  climate change, and scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of mitigation."
---

SBI addressed non-Annex I national communications, capacity  building, implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 (adverse effects)  and 4.9 (least developed countries), the UNFCCC's financial  mechanism, arrangements for intergovernmental meetings, and  administrative and financial matters.

Two in-session workshops mandated by SBSTA-19 also took place.  These dealt with the scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to,  climate change, and the scientific, technical, and socioeconomic  aspects of mitigation. The workshop on adaptation was held on  Friday, 18 June, while the one on mitigation took place on  Saturday, 19 June. Both were chaired by SBSTA Chair Abdullatif  Benrageb (Libya). Two other SBSTA events took place on Monday, 21  June: on research in response to the Third Assessment Report of  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and on the  Brazilian Proposal for differentiated emissions reduction targets  for Parties based on the impact of their historic emissions on  temperature rise.

While SB-20 was generally a low-key affair that saw little serious  conflict, the meeting was not without incident. In particular,  several new innovations and some increased technical complexities  emerged in the process. Delegates will now be looking ahead to  COP-10, and news of Russia's intentions towards the Kyoto  Protocol.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically-emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  IPCC, the effects of climate change have already been observed,  and a majority of scientists believe that precautionary and prompt  action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994. With the  recent accession of Turkey, the UNFCCC now has 189 Parties.

### KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference of  the Parties (COP-1) to the UNFCCC established the Ad Hoc Group on  the Berlin Mandate to negotiate an agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries with economies in transition (EITs) to  achieve quantified emissions reduction targets. These countries,  known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their  overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least 5% below  1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period),  with specific targets varying from country to country. The  Protocol also established three mechanisms to assist Annex I  Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively: an  emissions trading system; joint implementation (JI) of  emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and a Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM) that allows for projects to be  implemented in non-Annex I (developing country) Parties.

At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how countries will cut emissions  and measure and assess their emissions reductions. To enter into  force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC,  and by Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of their total  carbon dioxide emissions for 1990. To date, 122 Parties have  ratified the Protocol, including 32 Annex I Parties representing  44.2% of the emissions required for entry into force.

### BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

In November 1998, Parties met at  COP-4 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and agreed on a set of decisions  known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The BAPA set  COP-6 as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational  details of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the  UNFCCC. Issues to be addressed included rules relating to the  mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting  methods for national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules  on crediting countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC  that required resolution included questions of capacity building,  the development and transfer of technology, and assistance to  those developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 was held in The Hague, the Netherlands, from  13-25 November 2000. During the second week of negotiations, COP-6  President Jan Pronk of the Netherlands attempted to facilitate  negotiations on the many disputed political and technical issues  by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions. After almost 36  hours of intense talks in the final two days, negotiators could  not agree on a range of topics, particularly financial issues,  supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance with the  Protocol, and LULUCF. On Saturday afternoon, 25 November,  President Pronk announced that agreement had not been reached, and  Parties decided to suspend COP-6 and resume negotiations in 2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  agreement reached in Kyoto, stating that it considered the  Protocol to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage the US economy  and exempt key developing countries from emissions reduction  targets. Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II from 16-27 July 2001,  in Bonn. After protracted consultations, President Pronk presented  his proposal for a draft political decision. Despite support from  several Parties, disagreements surfaced over the nature of the  compliance regime. After several days of consultations, ministers  agreed to adopt President Pronk's political decision, with a  revised section on compliance. The political decision - or 'Bonn  Agreements' - needed to be operationalized through COP decisions.  These decisions were considered a 'package,' and since no  agreement was reached on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF,  all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates continued discussions on the 'Bonn Agreements' at  COP-7 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10 November 2001.  After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on LULUCF, mechanisms,  Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 and 8, and input to  the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was proposed.  Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups, some Annex  I Parties, including Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and  the Russian Federation, did not join the consensus, disputing,  among other things, eligibility requirements and credit banking  under the mechanisms. However, following extensive negotiations,  the 'Marrakesh Accords' were agreed.

### COP-8

Delegates to COP-8 met from 23 October to 1 November 2002,  in New Delhi, India. Parties considered institutional and  procedural issues under the Protocol and adopted several  decisions, including on the rules and procedures for the Executive  Board of the CDM. On the final day of COP-8, they adopted the  Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainable Development.  The Declaration reaffirms development and poverty eradication as  overriding priorities in developing countries, and recognizes  Parties' common but differentiated responsibilities and national  development priorities and circumstances in the implementation of  UNFCCC commitments.

### SB-18

Delegates to SB-18 met in Bonn from 4-13 June 2003. Parties  continued to address issues under negotiation since COP-8 and  prepare for the Protocol's entry into force. Conclusions were  agreed on a number of agenda items, including on Protocol Articles  5, 7 and 8. The issue of the Secretariat's programme budget for  2004-5 and the Special Climate Change Fund proved to be  particularly difficult, and discussions were left unfinished  until COP-9.

### COP-9

From 1-12 December 2003, Parties met at COP-9 and SB-19, in  Milan, Italy, to adopt 22 decisions and several conclusions. The  last outstanding detail of the BAPA was finalized when Parties  agreed on modalities and procedures for afforestation and  reforestation project activities under the CDM. Concluding  discussions on the Secretariat's programme budget for 2004-5 from  SB-18, Parties agreed to a 9% budget increase. Negotiations on the  operation of the Special Climate Change Fund and the Least  Developed Countries' (LDC) Fund proved to be challenging, with  protracted discussions on the LDC Fund postponing the closing of  the COP. Negotiations on good practice guidance for LULUCF were  also lengthy, and left for consideration by SB-20.

# SB-20 REPORT

The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice  (SBSTA) met five times during SB-20. As well as the Plenary  sessions, contact groups were also formed and informal  consultations were arranged to help prepare draft conclusions for  consideration by SBSTA, as well as draft COP decisions and  conclusions, and draft decisions for the COP serving as the  meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP). Parties  addressed various methodological issues during these meetings,  including: good practice guidance for LULUCF activities under the  Protocol, harvested wood products and other issues relating to  LULUCF; simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale  afforestation and reforestation project activities under the CDM;  emissions resulting from fuel used in international aviation and  maritime transport; issues relating to greenhouse gas inventories;  issues relating to Protocol Articles 7 and 8; and issues relating  to registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4. Parties also  addressed: the development and transfer of technology; 'good  practices' in policies and measures among Annex I Parties;  research and systematic observation; scientific, technical and  socioeconomic aspects of the impacts of, and vulnerability and  adaptation to, climate change (adaptation); scientific, technical  and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation; and cooperation with  relevant international organizations. Other matters addressed  included issues relating to cleaner or less greenhouse  gas-emitting energy, and the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3  (adverse effects of policies and measures).

The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) also met five times  during SB-20. As with SBSTA, the SBI Plenary sessions were  complemented by contact groups and informal consultations, which  were arranged to prepare draft conclusions for consideration by  SBI, as well as to negotiate draft COP decisions. SBI addressed a  variety of issues, including Annex I national communications, as  well as various aspects of non-Annex I national communications,  such as the submission of second, and where appropriate, third  national communications, the work of the Consultative Group of  Experts on non-Annex I national communications, and the provision  of financial and technical support. Parties also addressed a  number of other issues, including: the UNFCCC's financial  mechanism and matters relating to the implementation of decision  5/CP.8 (review of the financial mechanism); UNFCCC Article 6  (education, training and public awareness); capacity building;  implementation of UNFCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9, including progress  on the implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7  (implementation of UNFCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9) and matters  relating to LDCs. Parties also considered arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings, including arrangements for COP-10,  future sessional periods, the organization of the  intergovernmental process, effective participation in the UNFCCC  process, and arrangements for COP/MOP-1. In addition, the SBI  examined various administrative and financial matters, including  budget performance for the biennium 2004-2005, and implementation  of paragraph 7(c) of the financial procedures of the UNFCCC  concerning the financial support for participation in the UNFCCC  process. Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, and the  continuing review of the functions and operations of the  Secretariat, were also considered.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya)  opened SBSTA-20 on Wednesday morning, 16 June. Joke Waller-Hunter,  UNFCCC Executive Secretary, welcomed Turkey as the 189th UNFCCC  Party. Delegates then adopted the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/1)  without amendment.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

### Good practice guidance for LULUCF

This  issue was first addressed in the SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday, 16  June, and subsequently in a contact group. The contact group,  which met five times from 18-24 June, was co-chaired by Audun  Rosland (Norway) and William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana). Informal  consultations were also held in an effort to draft conclusions and  negotiate a draft decision for adoption at COP-10. On Friday, 25  June, SBSTA adopted conclusions on this matter.

The contact group addressed good practice guidance activities  under the Protocol, the issue of harvested wood products, and  other matters relating to LULUCF. A drafting group, chaired by  Maria José Sanz (Spain), was organized to complete the common  reporting format tables for reporting annual greenhouse gas  inventories from LULUCF activities under the Protocol.

IPCC good practice guidance experts were invited to the first  contact group meeting to present and answer questions on reporting  LULUCF activities under the Protocol.

On the good practice guidance common reporting format, debate  focused on two methods for identifying the geographical location  of reported LULUCF activities. The Alliance of Small Island States  (AOSIS) supported using the more detailed method of land  identification, whereas the EU and most other Parties supported  administrative units for land identification. Following intensive  discussions in the drafting group, common reporting format tables  were finally agreed on, except in regards to the identification of  LULUCF activities in relation to Protocol Article 6 (joint  implementation). Parties disagreed on the coding system to be  used for identifying activities in relation to joint  implementation projects.

On the issue of harvested wood products, delegates discussed the  scope and terms of reference for a workshop scheduled to be held  in Lillehammer, Norway, in August/September 2004.

On other LULUCF issues, delegates discussed definitions and  methodological options relating to degradation of forests and  devegetation of other vegetation types, and the issue of factoring  out direct-human induced effects from the indirect and natural  effects of LULUCF activities. Australia, with the US, Canada,  Japan and New Zealand, supported a broad approach to LULUCF  issues, namely an open-ended policy dialogue. The EU, AOSIS, and  the G-77/China preferred a focused approach, and suggested holding  a technical workshop after COP-10, which would consider  submissions by Parties. There was discussion on how to refer to  factoring out, with the G-77/China suggesting specific reference  to the Marrakesh Accords, while others preferred more general  references, including to submissions by Parties. The G-77/China  said it would present a concept paper on factoring out at SBSTA-21.

On Friday 25 June, SBSTA adopted conclusions on good practice  guidance, harvested wood products, and various other LULUCF  issues. Parties also adopted conclusions containing a bracketed  draft COP decision that includes the common reporting format  tables, and a bracketed draft COP/MOP decision  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.15/Add.1) for consideration at SBSTA-21.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions on LULUCF  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.15), SBSTA takes note of the methodological  guidance included in the IPCC's good practice guidance, and  elaborates the common reporting format tables for reporting  greenhouse gas inventories for LULUCF activities under Protocol  Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and  3.4 (additional LULUCF activities). The conclusions do not  finalize how identification codes in the common reporting format  tables may refer to LULUCF projects under Protocol Article 6, or  make any final determination on information related to reporting  on forest management under Article 3.4. These matters will instead  be taken up again at SBSTA-21, with a view to recommending a draft  decision on good practice guidance to COP-10. The conclusions also  request the UNFCCC Secretariat to prepare a note including a  proposal for technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments  under Protocol Article 5.2 (adjustments) of estimates of emissions  and removals from LULUCF, in order to recommend a decision to  COP-11. SBSTA-22 will discuss the criteria to be used for cases  where there is a failure to submit information on emissions and  removals from LULUCF activities under Article 3.3 and 3.4, for  consideration and adoption by the COP/MOP.

On harvested wood products, the SBSTA conclusions state that the  upcoming workshop on the issue will address: definitions and scope  of estimation, reporting and accounting of harvested wood  products; approaches for accounting for harvested wood products,  including socioeconomic and environmental implications; and  methods for estimating and reporting wood products. The workshop  should include presentations, group work and plenary discussions.

On other LULUCF issues, SBSTA takes note of the IPCC report on  degradation and devegetation, and decides to consider the issue at  future sessions, and to consider submissions by Parties on other  LULUCF issues at SBSTA-21.

Small-scale afforestation and reforestation project activities  under the CDM: This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in Plenary  on Wednesday, 16 June, and subsequently in a contact group, which  met four times from Thursday, 17 June through Wednesday, 23 June,  and was chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil). The contact group  considered a technical paper and draft conclusions on simplified  modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation and  reforestation project activities under the CDM. SBSTA adopted  conclusions in Plenary on Friday, 25 June. Simplified modalities  and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation  project activities under the CDM are contained in a bracketed  Annex to the draft conclusions.

Parties were unable to resolve issues of bundling (clustering  small projects to decrease transaction costs), leakage (unintended  consequences of activities leading to increasing emissions in an  area outside the project boundary), definitions of low-income  communities, and monitoring. On bundling, Bolivia, opposed by  AOSIS, Brazil, the EU and China, suggested consolidating various  small-scale projects. The issue was forwarded to SBSTA-21 for  further discussion. On leakage, Japan, supported by Canada and  India, but opposed by AOSIS, Brazil and the EU, preferred  exempting leakage due to high monitoring costs and the fact that  major impacts were unlikely, given the projects' small size. The  EU suggested the option of an extra percentage of additional  removals to account for leakage. After several rounds of informal  consultations, Parties agreed to address leakage by applying a  discount factor under certain circumstances, while assuming  non-leakage under others. Delegates also agreed that quality  assurance and quality control in monitoring would fall under the  CDM Executive Board's responsibility. Delegates discussed validation  procedures for project activities by the designated operational  entities. Discussions on this issue, and on simplified baseline  and monitoring methodologies, were not completed, and will be  taken up again at SBSTA-21.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.9), SBSTA  welcomes information provided in submissions from Parties on  simplified modalities and procedures for small-scale afforestation  and reforestation project activities under the CDM and on measures  to facilitate implementation of such activities. It also takes  note of a technical paper on the issue. SBSTA requests the  preparation of draft text for a decision on simplified modalities  and procedures for small-scale afforestation and reforestation CDM  project activities and on measures to facilitate the  implementation of these project activities, for consideration by  SBSTA-21. SBSTA also agrees to continue this work at SBSTA-21,  with a view to recommending a decision for adoption by COP-10.

Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime  transport: This issue was first addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on  Thursday, 17 June. Parties met in informal consultations,  facilitated by Greg Terrill (Australia), to consider draft  conclusions.

A number of Parties emphasized the importance of cooperation  between the UNFCCC, IPCC, International Civil Aviation  Organization and International Maritime Organization. Several  developing country Parties stressed the need to develop reporting  methodologies. Tuvalu and Kenya, opposed by Canada, said SBSTA  should broaden further guidance on the matter.

In the SBSTA Plenary on Friday, 25 June, facilitator Greg Terrill  reported that agreement had not been reached on forwarding a  document to the IPCC on methodological issues relating to  emissions from international aviation and maritime transport  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/INF.5). In the ensuing discussion, Saudi Arabia,  on behalf of the G-77/China, and supported by Oman, emphasized the  responsibilities of Annex I Parties regarding methodologies and  reporting. He stressed the importance of common but differentiated  responsibilities. Argentina, supported by AOSIS, emphasized the  importance of information gathering and maintaining this issue on  the agenda. Chair Benrageb proposed considering the document  paragraph-by-paragraph. Argentina, supported by the EU, and  opposed by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, proposed reflecting in the  conclusions that emissions from international aviation and  maritime transport would be addressed by SBSTA-21. Following  informal consultations, facilitator Terrill reported that Parties  were unable to reach agreement on holding a workshop or side-event  aimed at sharing information on emissions from international  aviation and maritime transport, and the draft conclusions were  adopted as amended to reflect the lack of agreement.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.12),  SBSTA notes that it did not complete its consideration of this  agenda item, and states that discussions will resume at SBSTA-21.

###     Issues relating to greenhouse gas inventories

This issue was  first addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June, and  subsequently in informal consultations co-facilitated by Helen  Plume (New Zealand) and Branca Americano (Brazil). The  consultations sought to address the Secretariat's report on  activities relating to the technical review of greenhouse gas  inventories for Annex I Parties, including the resulting  information on greenhouse gas emissions and trends. The  consultations also sought to provide additional guidance on  these matters.

In Plenary on Friday, 25 June, SBSTA adopted conclusions without  amendment. The agreement for expert review services is contained  in an Annex to the draft conclusions.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.6), SBSTA  welcomes the report on activities relating to the technical review  on greenhouse gas inventories of Annex I Parties, and notes that  these activities, including meetings of inventory lead reviewers  and the training programme for review experts, have contributed to  improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of the review  process, the quality of inventories and the reliability of  information available to the COP. SBSTA requests the Secretariat  to continue these activities, further improving the annual report  on Annex I greenhouse gas emissions and trends to the COP, and  including data from current year inventories in the report on  activities relating to the technical review on greenhouse gas  inventories of Annex-I Parties, if those inventories have been  subject to the Secretariat's quality control procedures. SBSTA  invites Annex I Parties to use the new common reporting format  software for inventory submissions in 2005. SBSTA also requests  Annex I Parties to submit inventory information on the LULUCF  sector for 2005, using provisional electronic spreadsheets.

###     Issues relating to Protocol Articles 7 and 8

This issue was first  addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June. Informal  consultations were co-facilitated by Helen Plume (New Zealand) and  Branca Americano (Brazil), in conjunction with informal  consultations on issues relating to greenhouse gas inventories  (see previous section). On Friday, 25 June, Parties adopted SBSTA  conclusions containing draft COP and COP/MOP decisions. Commenting  on this issue, the EU noted the importance of access to all  necessary information by expert review teams undertaking annual  reviews of greenhouse gas inventories, including information  deemed confidential by Parties, while the US stressed the  importance of protecting confidential information.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.7), SBSTA  decides to recommend a decision to COP-10, which includes a draft  COP/MOP decision, on ways of providing expert review teams with  access to the confidential inventory information of Annex I  Parties. SBSTA also recommends a decision to COP-10 on  incorporating modalities and procedures for afforestation and  reforestation project activities under the CDM into relevant  sections of the guidelines under Protocol Articles 7 and 8.

###     COP draft decisions

In the draft decision on issues relating to  the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories and  implementation of Article 8 (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.7/Add.1), the COP  requests Annex I Parties whose inventories contain information  that is designated as confidential to provide this information  during centralized and in-country reviews, at the request of the  expert review team, in accordance with the code of practice for  the treatment of confidential information adopted by decision  12/CP.9 (issues relating to the technical review of greenhouse gas  inventories from Annex I Parties). Under the draft decision, the  COP would also agree that an Annex I Party may, at its discretion  and in cooperation with the UNFCCC Secretariat, make confidential  inventory information available to expert review teams through  appropriate procedures when experts are not present either in the  country under review or at the UNFCCC Secretariat's offices. The  decision would have the COP also requesting the Secretariat to  avoid organizing desk reviews for those Annex I Parties where it  is known that the expert review team could not access confidential  information during the review, and to instead subject them to  centralized or in-country reviews.

In the attached draft COP/MOP decision, the COP/MOP decides that:  the previous draft COP decision will apply; the expert review team  shall note the relevant requested information that was designated  as confidential by the Annex I Party to which the team did not  have access; an expert review team may recommend the retroactive  application of an adjustment for the relevant years of the  commitment period for which the team was not given opportunities  to access confidential information; with respect to retroactive  adjustments, only the adjustment for the current inventory year  under review shall be relevant for eligibility requirements  related to Article 7; and for the inventory submitted for the  final years of the commitment period, all Annex I Parties shall  be subject to in-country or centralized reviews.

The draft decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.7/Add.2) on incorporating  the modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation  project activities under the CDM into the guidelines under  Protocol Articles 7 and 8 contains four Annexes, which deal with:  reporting of supplementary information under Protocol Article 7.1;  reporting of supplementary information under Protocol Article 7.2;  review of information on assigned amounts pursuant to Protocol  Article 3.7 and 3.8 (emission reduction units, certified emission  reductions, temporary certified emission reductions, long-term  certified emission reductions, assigned amount units and removal  units); and review of national registries.

###     Issues relating to registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4

This matter was first addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on Wednesday,  16 June, and subsequently in informal consultations facilitated by  Murray Ward (New Zealand). On Friday, 25 June Parties adopted  conclusions on the issue.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.8),  SBSTA, inter alia: welcomes the progress made by the Secretariat  on the specifications of the technical standards for data exchange  between registry systems; stresses the need to ensure, by SBSTA-21,  that the 1.0 version of these specifications is in accordance with  the general design requirements of the data exchange standards  recommended by decision 24/CP.8 (technical standards for data  exchange between registry systems under the Protocol) , for  adoption by COP/MOP-1; reaffirms the importance of making progress  on the development of the independent transaction log, and notes  that the log is currently expected to be established by mid-2005,  subject to the timely availability of funding and the extent of  modification required to be made to the programme code provided as  an in-kind contribution to the Secretariat. SBSTA also stresses  the need to ensure effective, long-term cooperation among  administrators of national registries, the CDM registry, the  independent transaction log and any supplementary transaction logs  established by Parties.

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

This issue was first  addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June. A contact  group co-chaired by Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) and Kishan Kumarsingh  (Trinidad and Tobago) met four times between Thursday, 17 June and  Tuesday, 22 June, to draft conclusions based on information  provided by the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT).  Parties adopted the conclusions in SBSTA Plenary on Friday, 25  June. Delegates discussed, among other things: how and whether the  results of the survey on the effectiveness of the use of the  UNFCCC technology information clearing house (TT:CLEAR) should be  reflected in the conclusions; the EGTT's 2005 work programme; a  workshop on innovative options for financing development and  transfer of technologies; and possible elements of a decision on  enhancing the implementation of the framework for technology  transfer, to be negotiated at SBSTA-21.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.2), SBSTA  encourages business and industry, non-governmental organizations  and relevant international organizations, to organize  sector-specific workshops and other activities relevant to enabling  environments for technology transfer. SBSTA notes the results of  the TT:CLEAR survey, and endorses an EGTT recommendation that a  workshop on innovative options for financing the development and  transfer of technologies should have a practical focus, and be  built around case studies. SBSTA urges Annex I Parties, and  organizations in a position to do so, to provide technical support  to developing country Parties undertaking technology needs  assessments. It also invites UNDP, UNEP, other relevant  organizations, as well as the Climate Technology Initiative, to  hold additional regional workshops to finalize the technology  needs assessments. SBSTA urges Parties to consider taking a  decision at COP-10 reflecting on progress and next steps to  enhance the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology  transfer).

The SBSTA conclusions invite UNDP, with UNEP and the GEF, to:  collect reports of technology needs assessments and prepare an  analysis of the technology needs identified by developing  countries, and report the findings to the EGTT; make available at  SBSTA-21 the most recent version of the handbook for conducting  technology needs assessments for climate change; and analyze  options for providing further technical support to Parties  completing their initial technology needs assessments, or updating  their needs assessments.

SBSTA requests the EGTT to consider the outcomes of the workshop  on innovative options for financing the development and transfer  of technologies. It also asks the EGTT to: explore possible ways  to enhance synergies with other global conventions and processes  where technology transfer and capacity building for technology  transfer are considered, and report on progress at SBSTA-22;  consider for its work programme for 2005 activities relating to  the identification of possible joint research programmes between  Annex I and non-Annex I Parties for the development of  environmentally sound technologies, and ways to enhance access to  scholarships and fellowships for non-Annex I Parties to build  capacity for the development and transfer of environmentally sound  technologies.

Finally, the SBSTA conclusions also request the Secretariat to  organize a special meeting of the EGTT in conjunction with the  workshop on innovative financing, and to organize a seminar on  technology transfer for adaptation to climate change in order to  discuss case studies. The Secretariat is asked to prepare a  technical paper on the applications of environmentally sound  technologies for adaptation to climate change, and to continue its  work on maintaining and improving TT:CLEAR.

### 'GOOD PRACTICES' IN POLICIES AND MEASURES

This issue was first  addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June. Co-chaired by  Anders Turesson (Sweden) and Tony Surridge (South Africa), a  contact group met three times from 21-23 June to draft  conclusions. SBSTA adopted the conclusions on Friday, 25 June.

During the discussions, debate centered on how to refer to  decision 13/CP.7 (policies and measures). The EU and other Parties  preferred to refer to the entire decision, while Saudi Arabia, for  the G-77/China, favored referring to sections of it, in particular  to the adverse effects of the implementation of policies and  measures. Tanzania, speaking for the Least Developed Countries,  stated that the G-77/China did not have a consensus position on  policies and measures. As an initial basis for discussion,  delegates used the latest version of a non-paper from COP-9. Based  on this, and on proposals made by the EU, G-77/China, and US, the  Co-Chairs prepared draft conclusions.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.5), SBSTA  agrees to next steps in implementing decision 13/CP.7, recalling  that steps should: facilitate cooperation among Annex I Parties by  sharing experiences and exchanging information at the technical  level; involve all Parties and, as appropriate, environmental and  business NGOs, and include the exchange of information on policies  and measures undertaken by Annex I Parties in all relevant  sectors; and contribute to the improvement of transparency,  effectiveness, and comparability of policies and measures. SBSTA  also notes that these steps should take into account  considerations such as environmental effectiveness, cost- effectiveness, social and economic impacts and ancillary benefits.  In addition, SBSTA invites Annex I Parties to make available  information on their experiences in implementing policies and  measures to all Parties at a technical roundtable discussion at  SBSTA-22. SBSTA also requests the UNFCCC Secretariat to provide  information on options for using, inter alia, Internet-based  approaches to sharing experiences and exchanging information on  'good practices' in policies and measures.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

This issue was first  addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June. Parties  convened in a contact group, co-chaired by Stefan Rösner (Germany)  and Sok Appadu (Mauritius), on Tuesday, 22 June and Wednesday, 23  June, to discuss draft conclusions. In discussing this issue,  several Parties noted a lack of available funding to improve  climate observation. The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)  Secretariat and WMO reported on relevant work. In the contact  group meetings, delegates debated reporting by the GCOS  Secretariat on support received by the GEF and other financial  mechanisms. Parties discussed timing for the GCOS report on  implementing regional action plans relating to global observing,  and submissions by Parties for consideration by SBSTA-21. SBSTA  adopted the conclusions on Friday, 25 June, without amendment.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.4),  SBSTA, inter alia: recognizes progress made by the GCOS  Secretariat in developing the 5-10 year implementation plan for  the integrated global observing systems for climate, in particular  the publication of the draft implementation plan for open review;  urges the GCOS Secretariat, in finalizing this plan, to clearly  identify priorities for actions, taking into account the views  expressed by Parties and relevant international programmes and  bodies; welcomes the collaboration between GCOS and the ad hoc  Group on Earth Observations in developing their respective  implementation plans, and urges both bodies to integrate them to  the extent possible; emphasizes the need to treat global climate  monitoring as a priority within the Global Earth Observation  System of Systems; encourages Parties to continue pursuing the  implementation of elements of the regional action plans developed  under the GCOS regional workshop programme; and invites the GCOS  Secretariat to report on progress made in implementing the  regional action plans in relation to global observing systems for  climate, including support from the UNFCCC's financial mechanism  and other bilateral and multilateral agencies and mechanisms, for  consideration by SBSTA-21 and subsequent sessions, as appropriate.

The SBSTA conclusions note the ongoing development of the GCOS  Cooperation Mechanism to address priority needs for improvements  in global observing systems for climate in developing countries,  and in particular the plans to develop an inventory of donor  activities relating to global observing systems for climate. SBSTA  invites the GCOS Secretariat, in consultation with the WMO, to  provide its full report on data exchange problems for  consideration by SBSTA-22. In particular, SBSTA encourages the  inclusion of options to remedy existing data exchange problems and  advice on problems associated with the accessibility of data by  and from global data centers.

SBSTA welcomes the exchange of views during the SBSTA-20 event on  research in response to the IPCC Third Assessment Report. The  following are noted as requiring further consideration:the need to assess the adequacy of research activities and  their international coordination to meet the needs of the UNFCCC; the importance of social, as well as natural, sciences, and  the interaction between the two, in responding to the research  needs arising from the assessment reports of the IPCC; and the enhancement of the capacity of developing countries to  contribute to, and participate in, global climate change research  efforts.

SBSTA requests Parties to submit to the Secretariat, by 15  September 2004, their views on how to address the main issues from  the SBSTA-20 event adequately, for consideration by SBSTA-21.  SBSTA requests Parties to submit to the Secretariat additional  views on this subject by 24 January 2005 for consideration by  SBSTA-22. It requests the Secretariat to compile both sets of  submissions into miscellaneous documents and to prepare a  synthesis of Parties' views for consideration by SBSTA-22.

### ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION

This issue was first addressed on 18  and 19 June, in two in-session workshops. The first addressed the  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change. The second dealt  with the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of  mitigation. Parties then addressed these items in Plenary on  Monday, 21 June. Delegates met three times in a contact group  co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and Kok Seng Yap (Malaysia), to  discuss draft conclusions. Informal consultations were also held.  SBSTA adopted conclusions on these matters on Friday, 25 June.

In the initial Plenary discussion on 21 June, several delegates  suggested holding future in-session workshops. Many Parties  stressed regional modeling, and noted the importance of  integrating sustainable development policies with adaptation  measures. Delegates also underscored the importance of addressing  innovative technologies, increasing the adaptive capacity of  vulnerable Parties, and separating short-term needs from the  long-term effects of climate change. South Africa, for the Africa  Group, supported by the G-77/China, AOSIS, and the Russian  Federation, called for separate contact groups on adaptation and  mitigation. Japan, Australia, Canada, the US and EU supported one  contact group. Chair Benrageb proposed having one contact group  with separate draft conclusions for each item.

In the contact group meetings, delegates considered draft  conclusions and discussed the format and content of future  workshops and activities. Parties debated ways of ensuring high  participation at workshops while avoiding overlap with  negotiations, and identified possible topics for discussion at  future workshops. Delegates disagreed over the number of topics  and themes to be considered. They also discussed the use and  potential resource implications of requesting the Secretariat to  compile background information on specific topics, and Parties'  submissions and workshop reports.

In the closing Plenary, China expressed hope that the  establishment of one contact group to address adaptation and  mitigation at SBSTA-20 would not set a precedent for future  decisions on the matter.

###     SBSTA conclusions on adaptation

In the conclusions on adaptation  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.13), SBSTA welcomes the exchange of views  during the in-session workshop and requests the Secretariat to  post the text of the Chair's oral report from the workshop on the  UNFCCC Internet site. SBSTA agrees to continue focusing its work  on exchanging information and sharing experiences and views among  Parties on practical opportunities and solutions to facilitate the  UNFCCC's implementation. SBSTA agrees that at SBSTA-21 it will  focus on exchanging information and sharing experiences, views and  lessons learned, taking into account different national  circumstances, on the application of methods and tools, including  regional models, for assessing impacts and vulnerability and  adaptation, and linkages between adaptation and sustainable  development.

The SBSTA conclusions request the Secretariat to:organize a workshop during SBSTA-21, under the guidance of  the SBSTA Chair, allowing for in-depth discussion to exchange  information and share experiences and views on the topics  identified above; prepare a background paper on the application of methods and  tools, including regional models, for assessing impacts and  vulnerability and developing adaptation responses, drawing on the  practices of relevant expert communities; and make available through the UNFCCC Internet site any published  papers related to the linkages between adaptation and sustainable  development.

In order to facilitate discussion at the SBSTA-21 workshop, SBSTA  invites Parties to submit views on the topics referred to above  and on the SBSTA-20 workshop, for compilation into a miscellaneous  document. SBSTA requests the SBSTA Chair to prepare a summary of  the workshop, and asks the Secretariat to make this summary, and  workshop presentations and abstracts, available on the UNFCCC  Internet site as soon as possible after the workshop. SBSTA agrees  to determine next steps on this agenda item at SBSTA-21.

###     SBSTA conclusions on mitigation

In the conclusions on mitigation  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.14), SBSTA welcomes the exchange of views  during the in-session workshop and requests the Secretariat to  post the text of Chair Benrageb's oral report from the workshop on  the UNFCCC Internet site. SBSTA agrees to continue focusing its  work on exchanging information and sharing experiences and views  among Parties on practical opportunities and solutions to  facilitate the UNFCCC's implementation. SBSTA further agrees that  it will focus at SBSTA-21 on exchanging information and  experiences, views and lessons learned on mitigation technology  innovation, deployment and diffusion (including identification and  removal of barriers), and practical opportunities and solutions  for mitigation that contribute to sustainable development, taking  into account different national circumstances.

The SBSTA conclusions request the Secretariat to organize a  workshop during SBSTA-21, under the guidance of the SBSTA Chair,  allowing for in-depth discussion to exchange information and share  experiences and views on the topics identified above. They also  ask the Secretariat make available the SBSTA Chair's summary of  the workshop, and the workshop presentations and abstracts, on the  UNFCCC Internet site, as soon as possible after the workshop.  SBSTA agrees to determine next steps on this agenda item at SBSTA-21.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

This issue  was first addressed by SBSTA in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June.  Parties met in informal consultations held throughout the session  to discuss draft conclusions and a draft COP-10 decision. The  consultations were facilitated by Outi Berghäll (Finland) and  Marcela Main (Chile). On Friday, 25 June, Parties adopted  conclusions and agreed to forward the draft COP decision to COP-10.

In the opening SBSTA Plenary, delegates heard statements from the  IPCC, UN Convention to Combat Desertification, Ramsar Convention  on Wetlands, UN Food and Agriculture Organization and  International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. Switzerland  suggested granting the Ramsar Convention permanent observer  status, while Palau said Ramsar should have full membership of the  Joint Liaison Group. Several Parties emphasized coordination among  national focal points. On Friday, 25 June, contact group Co-Chair  Berghäll emphasized that additional work was necessary to enhance  practical cooperation between the Rio Conventions.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.3), SBSTA  notes the important contribution that the Ramsar Secretariat can  make to the work of the Joint Liaison Group and encourages its  continued involvement. SBSTA notes the Joint Liaison Group's plan  to prepare a paper on options for enhanced cooperation among the  Rio Conventions, and requests the Secretariat to present this  paper for consideration by SBSTA as soon as it is available. SBSTA  invites the Secretariat to continue exchanging information with  the Secretariats of the Convention on Biological Diversity and  Convention to Combat Desertification, via the Joint Liaison Group,  and to improve inter-accessibility of available data, including  through better Internet-based access, within existing resources.  In response to the invitation from COP-7 of the Convention on  Biological Diversity to the UNFCCC COP, SBSTA decides to recommend  a draft conclusion on the issue of biodiversity and climate change  for adoption by UNFCCC COP-10.

###     Draft COP conclusions

In the draft COP conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.3/Add.1), the COP requests the Secretariat,  within existing resources, to provide information to the Joint  Liaison Group on relevant activities that are mutually supportive  of the objectives of the Rio Conventions, based on existing  information publicly available and already provided by Parties  under the UNFCCC. The COP also encourages Parties to enhance  coordination under the Rio Conventions at the national level by  facilitating the involvement of national experts, and by sharing  relevant information at local and national levels, where possible  and appropriate.

### OTHER MATTERS

Issues relating to cleaner or less greenhouse  gas-emitting energy: This issue was addressed by SBSTA in Plenary  on Thursday, 17 June. Chair Benrageb facilitated informal  consultations on the matter, and SBSTA adopted conclusions on  Friday, 25 June. Chair Benrageb expressed disappointment that  Parties were unable to reach agreement, and urged delegates to  advise him on how to make progress at SBSTA-21. Nigeria said a new  approach was needed, and suggested that the issue be handled  bilaterally.

###     SBSTA conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.10),  SBSTA agrees to continue consideration of the matter at SBSTA-21,  as consideration at SBSTA-20 was not completed.

###     Issues relating to the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3

### REPORT ON THE SBSTA SESSION

In closing SBSTA-20, the UNFCCC  Executive Secretary commented on the preliminary evaluation of the  financial implications of the conclusions adopted at SB-20, as  mandated by decision 16/CP.9 (programme budget for the biennium  2004-2005). She indicated that SB-20 had generated additional  demands on the Trust Fund for Supplemental Activities at a time  when numerous activities remain unfunded, and that funding is low  for the participation of delegates from LDCs and small island  developing States (SIDS). She noted that SBSTA and SBI have  mandated eight additional meetings. She also observed that the  request for a workshop on the intergovernmental process indicated  room for improving the process.

SBSTA Rapporteur Ibrahim Bin Ahmed Al-Ajmi (Oman) introduced the  draft report on SBSTA-20 (FCCC/SBSTA/2004/L.1), which was adopted  without amendment. Parties expressed their appreciation to Chair  Benrageb, delegates and the UNFCCC Secretariat. Thanking Parties  for their hard work, Chair Benrageb gaveled the meeting to a close  at 1:40 pm.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

SBI Chair Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria)  opened SBI-20 on Wednesday morning, 16 June. Qatar, for the  G-77/China, requested SBI-20 to consider arrangements for COP/MOP-1,  given the possibility that the Protocol could enter into force  before the next session.

Parties adopted the SBI agenda as amended by the G-77/ China  (FCCC/SBI/2004/1). Regarding the election of officers, Chair  Stoycheva said Fadhel Lari (Kuwait) would continue to serve as SBI  Vice-Chair, and Gonzalo Menéndez (Panama) would be the Rapporteur.

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Status report on the review of  third national communications: This issue was addressed by SBI in  Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June. The EU expressed satisfaction that  the majority of Annex I reviews had been completed and posted on  the UNFCCC Internet site. SBI took note of the issue.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

This issue was first raised  in the SBI Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June, and subsequently in a  contact group chaired by Sok Appadu (Mauritius), which met five  times between Saturday, 19 June and Wednesday, 23 June. In the  contact group, Parties discussed the submission of second and,  where appropriate, third national communications, the work of the  Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national  communications, and the provision of financial and technical  support. Parties then adopted three sets of conclusions in SBI  Plenary, on Friday, 25 June.

Discussions on the timing of non-Annex I national communications,  and on funding for the national communications, proved to be the  most challenging. On the submission of second and third national  communications, delegates discussed timing of submissions. The US,  opposed by the G-77/China, proposed that non-Annex I Parties  should submit greenhouse gas inventories every two years. On the  timing of non-Annex I national communications, the EU suggested  three years. The G-77/China proposed six years.

The EU, opposed by the G-77/China, also proposed text requesting  non-Annex I Parties to submit funding proposals for national  communications even in advance of substantial completion of  previous national communications, but not later than one year  after the submission of their previous national communications.  The G-77/China expressed concern that the reference to one year  could be interpreted as a deadline by the GEF.

On Friday, 25 June, Chair Stoycheva announced that the G-77/China  had submitted a package proposal earlier that day on the  paragraphs addressing timing of submission (FCCC/SBI/2004/MISC.3).  The proposal, inter alia, invited non-Annex I Parties that have  not submitted project proposals for second and, where appropriate,  third national communications to do so even in advance of  substantially completing previously-funded activities. It also  called on non-Annex I Parties to submit their second, and where  appropriate, third national communications within five years of  the initial disbursement of financial resources for the actual  preparation of the national communication. Chair Stoycheva said  that as there was no time to discuss the document, it would be  forwarded to SBI-21. The US noted that the document contained  interesting proposals, and asked that it be left open for  additional views from Parties.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions on submission of second and,  where appropriate, third national communications  (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.10), the SBI decides to continue deliberations on  an attached bracketed draft COP decision at SBI-21.

In the conclusions on the work of the Consultative Group of  Experts on non-Annex I communications (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.8), SBI  welcomes the efforts of the Group in prioritizing activities  within its multi-year programme of work. It invites Annex II  (industrialized country) Parties, and other Parties in a position  to do so, to provide financial and technical support for these  activities. SBI welcomes efforts to cooperate with the LDC Expert  Group and the Expert Group on Technology Transfer, as well as the  offer by Panama to host the first hands-on training workshop on  greenhouse gas inventories. SBI calls for closer cooperation  between the Consultative Group of Experts and the UNDP/GEF  National Communications Support Programme.

In the conclusions on financial and technical support  (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.9), SBI welcomes the submission by 115 non-Annex  I Parties of their initial national communications and the  submission of three second national communications. SBI takes note  of the needs and concerns of non-Annex I Parties relating to  specific capacity building and training, and reiterates the need  to strengthen national institutions, regional and sub-regional  climate change centers and centers of excellence, especially in  LDCs and SIDS.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM OF THE CONVENTION

Matters relating to the  implementation of decision 5/CP.8: This issue was first addressed  by SBI in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June. Chair Stoycheva requested  Andrea Albán (Colombia) and Sarah Hendry (UK) to co-facilitate  informal consultations on the issue, with the aim of drafting  conclusions.

Discussions focused on a request to the Secretariat to prepare a  report for COP-10 on the assessment of funding necessary to assist  developing countries in fulfilling their UNFCCC commitments, and  on the data to be contained in the report. Parties adopted the  conclusions. The UNFCCC Executive Secretary expressed her  understanding that, when preparing the report, the Secretariat  should use information from, inter alia, the GEF documents,  information on multilateral sources of funding, and national  communications. Japan recalled the distinct roles of the GEF and  COP in jointly determining the amount of available funding. He  noted reservations against the report going beyond the mandate of  the Memorandum of Understanding between the GEF and the COP.  Argentina said the third GEF replenishment was limited and lower  than previous cycles, and cautioned against the decreasing amount  of funding. He expressed hope that consultations on the matter in  future UNFCCC sessions would be more successful.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/CRP.1), SBI  welcomes the successful and substantial third replenishment of the  GEF Trust Fund. It notes that inputs by the COP to discussions on  the fourth replenishment should be consistent with provisions of  the UNFCCC and the annex to the Memorandum of Understanding  between the COP and GEF Council on the determination of funding  necessary and available for the implementation of the UNFCCC. SBI  requests the UNFCCC Secretariat, in collaboration with the GEF  Secretariat, to prepare a report for COP-10 on the assessment of  funding necessary to assist developing country Parties in  fulfilling their commitments that will assist in determining  jointly with the GEF Council the amount of funding necessary and  available for the implementation of the UNFCCC as defined in the  Memorandum of Understanding between the COP and the GEF Council.  The report should be based on information and data identified in  the Memorandum of Understanding on the determination of the level  of funding necessary and available for UNFCCC implementation, in  accordance with guidance provided by the COP. It should also  contain the data and methodology used by the Secretariat to  prepare the report, in order to enable the results' verification  at a later stage. The conclusions agree that deliberations should  continue at SBI-21, with a view to preparing a draft decision for  adoption by COP-10.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public  awareness) was first raised by SBI in Plenary on Wednesday, 16  June. A contact group, chaired by Markus Nauser (Switzerland),  convened four times from 18-23 June, to prepare draft conclusions  and consider input to further develop the information network  clearing house. In the SBI Plenary on Thursday, 24 June, Parties  adopted the relevant SBI conclusions on the matter.

Discussions sought to provide guidance to the Secretariat for  elaboration of the UNFCCC information network clearing house for  Article 6 activities. Debates focused on timing and funding for  the development of the clearing house. Parties also deliberated  the date for submission and content of the reports on implementing  the New Delhi work programme on Article 6. Delegates considered  how the information in the reports would relate to information  provided in national communications, and discussed the elements of  the first phase of work on the clearing house.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.6), SBI  encourages Parties to cooperate in the key areas identified at the  African regional workshop held in January 2004. SBI requests the  Secretariat to prepare an intermediate review report on progress  in implementing Article 6, based on information contained in  national communications and other information received by the  Secretariat, by 15 August 2004. The report of the submissions will  form the basis for a draft COP-10 decision. Regarding the  small-scale model of the Article 6 information network clearing  house, SBI requests the Secretariat to report to SBI-21 on progress  of work, including: detailed technical specifications for the  development and implementation of the clearing house; a profile  for an institutional home for the clearing house; a tentative time  frame for implementation; and options, and their estimated  financial implications, for developing and implementing the  clearing house.

SBI invites Parties, and others in a position to do so, to  contribute to financing the remaining regional workshops. The  annex to the conclusions contains consolidated views of Parties  and guidance to the Secretariat on the further development of the  Article 6 information network clearing house.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This issue was first addressed by SBI in  Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June, and subsequently in a contact group  chaired by Dechen Tsering (Bhutan). The contact group met four  times from 18-22 June. On Thursday, 24 June, Parties adopted SBI  conclusions on the issue.

Discussions in the contact group centered on, inter alia: elements  of a technical paper on the range and effectiveness of capacity  building, including indicators for capacity-building projects; the  need for a technical workshop to contribute to the review; and the  relevance of National Capacity Self Assessments in assessing  capacity needs for climate change.

Tanzania, on behalf of the G-77/China, along with the US and  Romania, speaking for the economies in transition, expressed  concerns at insufficient information provided for the  comprehensive review of the implementation of the framework for  capacity building in developing countries, and for the compilation  and synthesis of capacity-building activities in economies in  transition (EITs). They argued that further work is needed on the  comprehensive review. The EU and Japan did not agree with this  position. Several Parties welcomed a substantive discussion to  identify gaps. Parties agreed to a meeting of practitioners to  contribute to the comprehensive review.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.5), SBI  decides to, inter alia: complete a draft decision at SBI-21 on the  range and effectiveness of capacity-building activities in  developing countries aimed at implementing decision 2/CP.7  (capacity building in developing countries); request the  Secretariat to convene a meeting of practitioners with the aim of  contributing to the comprehensive review at COP-10, and to present  the outcome to SBI-21; invite additional information on the  effectiveness of capacity-building activities in EITs; and request  the Secretariat to prepare an analytical paper on the  effectiveness of the implementation of the framework for capacity  building in EITs.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

Progress on the  implementation of activities under decision 5/CP.7: This issue was  first discussed by SBI in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June, and  subsequently in a contact group co-chaired by Mohamed Mahmoud Ould  El Ghaouth (Mauritania) and Paul Watkinson (France). In the  contact group, which met five times between Thursday, 17 June and  Wednesday, 23 June, delegates negotiated text forwarded from  SBI-19. Parties adopted conclusions in the SBI Plenary on Friday,  25 June.

Parties discussed the structure of the document. Kenya, for the  G-77/China, suggested re-organizing the document under sub-headings,  and circulated proposed changes and additions.

Delegates worked to remove brackets, and presented changes and  additions on, inter alia: a synthesis document on submissions on  activities to meet the specific needs and circumstances of  developing country Parties arising from the adverse effects of  climate change and response measures; a call for submissions of  views on insurance and risk measures; regional workshops; and  mobilization of technical and financial resources.

Delegates also discussed alternative textual proposals on whether,  how or when to consider the outcomes of the workshop on the status  of modeling activities and action on these outcomes. Parties  discussed options for text on impacts of response measures, and  text on addressing and promoting economic diversification.

Peru highlighted difficulties in proving global benefits of  adaptation projects for accessing GEF funds. Micronesia, for  AOSIS, emphasized data collection and technologies for adaptation.  Delegates discussed the Special Climate Change Fund, and the  frequency and format of feedback from the GEF on activities  undertaken in response to decision 5/CP.7, including efforts to  address or mainstream adaptation within climate change and other  GEF focal areas.

On Friday, 25 June, contact group Co-Chair Paul Watkinson reported  that although significant progress had been made, no decision had  been reached. Argentina called for adaptation to be addressed at  joint meetings of the SBI and SBSTA. Chair Stoycheva responded  that the issue would be brought to the attention of the COP Bureau  at its next meeting.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.11), the SBI  decides to continue consideration of issues under this item at its  next session.

###     Matters relating to the least developed countries (LDCs)

This  issue was first addressed by SBI in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June,  where LDC Expert Group Chair La'avasa Malua (Samoa) reported on  the meeting of the Group in March 2004. The Gambia offered to host  the next Expert Group meeting. On Thursday, 24 June, SBI adopted  conclusions on the matter, without amendment. Tanzania informed  Parties of a proposed LDCs meeting prior to COP-10, inviting  Parties to contribute financial resources.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.4), SBI  endorses the proposed work programme of the LDC Expert Group for  its second term (2004-2005), and invites the Chair to update  SBI-21 on progress.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This issue was first  addressed by SBI in Plenary on Thursday, 17 June, and subsequently  in a contact group charged with drafting conclusions on the  subject, and chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany). The contact group  considered: arrangements for COP-10; future sessional periods;  organization of the intergovernmental process; effective  participation in the UNFCCC process; and an additional sub-item on  arrangements for COP/MOP-1 proposed by the G-77/China. The contact  group met three times between Friday, 18 June and Wednesday, 23  June. Parties adopted conclusions in the SBI Plenary held on  Thursday, 24 June.

On arrangements for COP-10, discussions centered around the  timing, structure and themes of the high-level segment. Several  Parties, including Norway, Iceland, the EU, South Africa, AOSIS,  Burkina Faso and Canada, urged discussions on energy. Saudi Arabia  opposed this idea. On future sessional periods and organization of  the intergovernmental process, Parties discussed the possibility  of extending the period between COPs, and rationalizing the  workload of the negotiating process.

On effective participation in the UNFCCC process, debates focused  on the participation and admission of observers, and on responding  to a request by the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues to  establish an ad hoc open-ended working group on indigenous peoples  and climate change. While some Parties supported exploring  opportunities for participation by indigenous peoples, others felt  representation on national delegations would be sufficient.

Regarding the participation of observers, the US said his  delegation was seeking to have a physical presence during meetings  of the CDM Executive Board. Chair Sach said the issue of observer  status to the CDM Executive Board was regulated by an existing COP  decision (decision 21/CP.8 on the CDM Executive Board). Opposed by  the EU, the US called for text clarifying that participation  includes a physical presence, and suggested reviewing the issue at  SBI-22. Parties deliberated over whether to include a paragraph  taking note of the concern expressed by the US with respect to the  interpretation of the Rules of Procedure on transparency and  attendance of the CDM Executive Board. In the end, Parties agreed  to reflect the concern of the US in the conclusions.

On the membership of constituencies involved in the climate change  process, the US raised concerns regarding the criteria for  membership of the Research and Independent NGOs (RINGOs). RINGOs  indicated that the intention of membership criteria was simply to  clarify how members are distinguished from other constituencies.  The US, supported by the G-77/China but opposed by the EU, called  for a review of the approach for selecting membership of  constituencies.

###     SBI conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.7), SBI  addresses a variety of issues relating to arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings. Regarding COP-10, SBI recognizes that  2004 is the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the  UNFCCC, and that this will serve as the central theme for COP-10.  It endorses the dates of 15-17 December 2004 for the high-level  segment. SBI also recommends panel discussions during the high- level segment, on four themes: The UNFCCC after 10 years -  accomplishments and future challenges; Impacts of climate change,  adaptation measures and sustainable development; Technology and  climate change; and Mitigation of climate change - policies and  their impacts. On the organization of the intergovernmental  process, the SBI conclusions request the Secretariat to convene a  workshop in conjunction with SBI-21, and to prepare a background  paper taking into account relevant experience in other  multilateral processes.

On effective participation in the UNFCCC process, SBI takes note  of a concern expressed with respect to the interpretation of the  Rules of Procedure of the CDM Executive Board as it relates to  transparency and attendance. It agrees to continue consideration  of effective participation at SBI-22, on the basis of submissions  received by 31 January 2005. Regarding participation of observer  organizations, SBI takes note of the Secretariat's current  approach , and agrees to continue consideration of the matter. SBI  agrees that requests for the submission of information and views  could be extended to NGOs, on the understanding that such  submissions would not be issued as official documents, but would  be made available on the Secretariat website. Regarding the  participation of indigenous peoples, SBI encourages Indigenous  Peoples' Organizations to make use of the existing bodies and  opportunities available to them under the UNFCCC, and acknowledges  the importance of enhanced participation by such organizations in  the UNFCCC process.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Budget performance for the  biennium 2004-2005: This issue was first addressed by SBI in  Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June, when Chair Stoycheva said she would  prepare draft conclusions on the issue. In the SBI Plenary on  Thursday, 24 June, Chair Stoycheva presented the conclusions,  which Parties adopted without amendment.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.2), SBI takes  note of the information of the work programme for 2004-2005  relating to UNFCCC Article 4.8. SBI also takes note of the status  of contributions as of 31 May 2004. SBI expresses appreciation to  the Parties that have made their contributions to the core budget  in time and in full, and particularly to those Parties that have  made contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation and the  Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities. It urges Parties that  have not yet made their contributions to the core budget to do so  as soon as possible. SBI stresses the importance of maintaining a  high level of contributions to the Trust Fund for Participation in  the UNFCCC Process to ensure effective participation at UNFCCC  sessions by developing countries, especially least developed  countries and small island developing States.

Implementation of paragraph 7(c) of the financial procedures of  the UNFCCC concerning financial support for participation in the  UNFCCC process: This issue was addressed by the SBI Plenary on  Wednesday, 16 June. The Secretariat outlined the impacts of the  practice of not funding the participation of Parties whose  contributions are outstanding. Argentina and Colombia said  outstanding contributions by developing countries should not be  interpreted as a lack of willingness to pay. The SBI took note of  the issue.

###     Implementation of the Headquarters Agreement

This issue was first  addressed by SBI in Plenary on Wednesday, 16 June. Germany, as  host government, briefed participants on progress in creating a UN  campus for convention secretariats based in Bonn. On Thursday, 24  June, SBI adopted conclusions on the matter, without amendment.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.3), SBI takes  note of the statement by Germany regarding the UN campus and  international conference center in Bonn.

### CONTINUING REVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS AND OPERATIONS OF THE  SECRETARIAT

SBI first addressed this issue in Plenary on  Thursday, 17 June. Chair Stoycheva carried out informal  consultations on the matter. Conclusions were adopted by SBI on  Friday, 25 June.

India, for the G-77/China, called for balanced geographical  representation in the UNFCCC Secretariat, neutrality in preparing  documents, and equity in the allocation of resources for issues  concerning developing and developed countries. The EU and Canada  expressed their satisfaction with the functioning of the  Secretariat. Saudi Arabia requested the Secretariat to ensure that  the views of all Parties are adequately reflected when making  statements on behalf of the UNFCCC. The UNFCCC Executive Secretary  stressed that the Secretariat is committed to transparency and  equal representation, and welcomed feedback on its functioning.

###     SBI conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.12), SBI  agrees to continue consideration of this item at SBI-21, and  requests the Secretariat to provide information on the  arrangements for UNFCCC workshops, including such issues as  criteria, scheduling and managing with limited funds.

### REPORT ON THE SESSION

In closing, the UNFCCC Executive Secretary  repeated comments made in SBSTA regarding the financial  implications of conclusions adopted at SB-20. On behalf of SBI  Rapporteur Gonzalo Menéndez, Chair Stoycheva invited Parties to  consider the report on the session (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.1), which  Parties adopted without amendment.

The US expressed gratitude to the Executive Secretary for her  comments on the financial implications of the adopted conclusions.  Qatar, for the G-77/China, looked forward to COP-10. The EU said  negotiations had provided a clearer picture and expressed hope for  discussions at SBI-21. Chair Stoycheva closed SBI-20 at 4:25 pm.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF SB-20

In the war to save the world from climate change, SB-20 turned out  to be just a minor skirmish, with only sporadic shots fired. But  although it was generally a quiet event that saw little serious  conflict, the meeting was not totally without incident. In  particular, several new innovations and some increased technical  complexities emerged in the process. This analysis reviews the  state of play in the climate negotiations, focusing on those new  complexities and innovations that came to the fore at SB-20, and  on hopes for COP-10 and beyond.

# TIME TO TALK

A relatively relaxed pace at SB-20 allowed delegates to make  notable progress on aspects that had been sidelined until now,  such as 'good practices' in policies and measures. It also gave  them the chance to explore some innovation in their negotiations.  For instance, not all the contact groups immediately started work  on negotiating text. On some traditionally controversial issues  such as the timing of submissions of non-Annex I national  communications, Chairs chose to facilitate an open exchange of  ideas on how progress could be made, instead of putting pressure  on delegates to deliver agreed text.

The in-session workshops, a new addition to the UNFCCC process,  were a further step in exploring ways to encourage discussion and  exchange information without having to state entrenched national  positions. The workshops were well attended, and most participants  felt they provided a helpful forum to make progress on  controversial issues. Delegates observed that the discussion on  adaptation and mitigation, for instance, allowed for a broader  dialogue on the future of the climate negotiations and a more  candid discussion on North-South differences. On the other hand,  some observers did feel that future topics should be more focused,  and presentations and discussions more result-oriented, so as to  be relevant to policy makers. Some concerns were also expressed  that the workshops took delegates away from important negotiations.

There were other suggestions made during negotiations at SB-20 to  make the format more interactive. Drawing attention to their  difficulties in interacting with the UNFCCC financial mechanism,  some developing countries suggested holding in-session question- and-answer meetings with the GEF. Meanwhile, delegates also spent  considerable time discussing the format of the high-level segment  at COP-10, to ensure that interventions by ministers and heads of  states at COP-10 go beyond the simple delivery of pre-written  statements.

These new innovations were aimed at making the process more open  and interactive, and are similar to attempts in the CSD process to  promote genuine dialogue and discussion. However, there were some  concerns that in other areas the negotiations may be taking a step  backwards when it comes to stakeholder participation. Observers  expressed concerns on discussions calling for a review of the  process for accrediting and recognizing observers and  constituencies, at the behest of the US and Saudi Arabia, fearing  that this could be used to restrict or limit participation.

# ANGELS ON PINHEADS

As the negotiations under the UNFCCC hit their ten-year mark, an  element of repetition or déjà vu seems to have crept in. In  several discussions, such as those on non-Annex I national  communications, previously agreed text made a reappearance,  sometimes in what seemed like attempts by some countries to  re-open discussions on agreements that they felt did not adequately  address their concerns. In such cases, there were often complaints  that text was repeated selectively, to highlight the priorities of  one group (such as on adaptation and vulnerability), while  deliberately underplaying others (for instance, greenhouse gas  inventories).

In other cases, such as the discussions on the common reporting  format in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance, the negotiations turned  increasingly complex, and were likened by one delegate to  'medieval philosophers arguing about angels on the heads of pins.'  Delegates spent hours negotiating methods for identifying units to  measure changes in land use, in order to balance concerns about  the level of detail required to ensure the integrity of the  process, and its practical implementation. Meanwhile, on the  question of simplifying modalities and procedures for small-scale  afforestation and reforestation projects under the CDM, some  developing countries pushed for consideration of 'bundling' small  projects together to cut transaction costs, while others,  including AOSIS and Brazil, feared that this would encourage foul  play, with small-scale projects being combined to take advantage  of simpler procedures. With many issues still outstanding, several  African countries were frustrated by the process, which seemed to  be torn between the need for complicated, technical procedures to  ensure environmental integrity on the one hand, and a desire for  simplicity to encourage community-level implementation on the other.

Negotiators arguing the finer details of LULUCF and CDM in SBSTA  seemed unaware of the practical difficulties of implementation  being discussed in SBI, where many developing countries were  already voicing concerns over their inability to keep up with  existing technical requirements, such as the greenhouse gas  inventories, and were calling for assistance to improve capacity.  The complicated rules being discussed for small-scale CDM  projects, for instance, are bound to create difficulties in  implementation (with communities having, for example, to be aware  of complex rules, such as in monitoring procedures). Concerns were  expressed about the level of access and transparency in these  discussions, particularly for many developing countries, not just  because of the complexity of negotiations but also because most of  the discussions were held in a small 'friends of the chair' group.

As negotiations became bogged down in the minutiae of issues such  as tracking Annex I emissions from harvested wood products,  observers commented that a simpler way to deal with climate  mitigation might be to focus on renewable sources of energy, and  avoid the traps of overly complex accounting, which ultimately  could contribute very little to mitigating climate change. Before  the negotiations proceed to higher levels of complexity, they  said, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of the new  innovations in the UNFCCC format, and engaging in an open dialogue  to assess compatibility between science and the practical  difficulties of implementation.

# AND DEVILS IN THE DETAILS

The SBI discussions were generally concerned with more practical  matters, such as addressing continuing problems with lack of  capacity to implement agreements, difficulties in accessing  financial and technical resources, the frequency of national  communications, and addressing the adverse impacts of climate  change. In the discussions on capacity building, developing  countries and economies in transition felt the ongoing review of  capacity-building activities did not adequately reflect their  concerns. In several SBI contact groups, ongoing frustrations with  the UNFCCC's financial mechanism were expressed. For instance,  developing countries articulated the difficulties in proving the  'global benefit' of adaptation projects to access funds from the  GEF. Concern was also expressed with the ongoing discussions in  the GEF Council on linking financial assistance to performance- based assessments.

Talks on the implementation of Articles 4.8 and 4.9 continued to  be weighed down by disagreement on the need to address the impacts  of mitigation measures. There appeared to be an attempt from  within the G-77/China to dissolve the unhappy marriage of impacts  of response measures with adverse impacts of climate change, but  with little success due to opposition from oil-producing  countries. There did seem to be some movement, however, on the  timing of non-Annex I national communications. Although no  agreement was reached, the G-77/China introduced a proposal on the  last day of the negotiations, expressing a willingness to submit  second and, where appropriate, third national communications  within five years of receiving the funds for their preparation,  instead of the six years suggested by the EU. It appears likely  that progress will be made when this proposal is discussed at the  next session, although the issue of applying for funds before  completion of previous national communications still remains  controversial.

SBI discussions on intergovernmental arrangements attracted  considerable interest, as delegates discussed a suitable platform  for heads of state and ministers to express their views on the  future of the negotiations. The relevant contact group also  discussed a request from the US to gain access to the Executive  Board of the Clean Development Mechanism, without being party to  the Kyoto Protocol. Although it was pointed out that a COP  decision already addressed this issue, some seemed in favor of  allowing the US observer status, in what appeared to be an attempt  to keep the door open for future US engagement. However, others  felt that denying the US a role in the CDM Executive Board was one  of the very few ways of putting them under pressure to reconsider  their stand, as US industry is keen to keep engaged in the CDM  process.

# RUSSIAN ROULETTE

'A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,' is how Winston  Churchill once described Russia. He was speaking in 1939, but his  comments could easily apply today, especially when it comes to  deciphering the country's position on the Kyoto Protocol. Perhaps  the relatively relaxed pace of negotiations at SB-20 can be  attributed in part to the fact that delegates are still waiting on  Russia's all-important decision that will determine Kyoto's fate.  Some observers seemed impressed that negotiators at SB-20 were  able to engage in such complex and intricate negotiations, let  alone seek innovations to improve the process, when the future of  the Protocol remains in such doubt. Although the issue of Russian  ratification was not mentioned too often at SB-20 - perhaps  because participants are tired of the news networks having cried  wolf too often in the past - it must have been ever-present in the  minds of the delegates. Many secretly seem to be hoping that  Russian ratification will be announced in Buenos Aires in  December. If this happens, the tenth Conference of the Parties  (and tenth anniversary celebrations) will without doubt mark the  end of the 'quiet' times experienced lately, and the beginning of  an exciting new stage in the ongoing fight to save the world from  climate change.
