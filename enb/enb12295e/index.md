abstract: "The twenty-fifth session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC-25) took place in Port Louis, Mauritius, from 26-28  April 2006. The meeting was attended by approximately 270  participants representing governments, UN agencies and non- governmental organizations. The meeting saw the acceptance of the  2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and  adoption of its Overview Chapter, thereby realizing several years  of work by the IPCC. Delegates also took action in relation to the  IPCC programme and budget for 2007-09, further work on emission  scenarios, election procedures, a policy and process for admitting  observer organizations, the future work programme of the Task  Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, consideration of a  Special Report on Renewable Energy, and a review of the IPCC's  terms of reference. Discussions also took place on communications  and outreach activities, matters related to the United Nations  Framework Convention on Climate Change and progress toward the  Fourth Assessment Report and other IPCC activities. The acceptance  of the 2006 Guidelines and the decision on further work on  emission scenarios reflected the spirit that characterized IPCC-25,  with delegates working hard to overcome differences in order to  make progress. These efforts brought the meeting to a close on  Friday afternoon with the successful resolution of all agenda  items."

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme  (UNEP). The purpose of the IPCC is to assess the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding  the risks associated with human-induced climate change. The IPCC  does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor climate- related data, but bases its assessments on published and peer- reviewed scientific and technical literature. Its Secretariat is  located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is staffed by the WMO and  UNEP.

Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of  comprehensive assessments, special reports and technical papers,  which provide scientific information on climate change to the  international community, including policy makers and the public.  This information has played an important role in negotiations  under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC).

The IPCC currently has three working groups: Working Group I  addresses the scientific aspects of the climate system and climate  change; Working Group II addresses the vulnerability of  socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, negative and  positive consequences of climate change, and adaptation options;  and Working Group III addresses options for limiting greenhouse  gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change.

The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas  Inventories (TFI). The TFI oversees the IPCC National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories Programme (NGGIP), which aims to develop and  refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the  calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and  removals, and to encourage the use of this methodology by  countries participating in the IPCC and by UNFCCC signatories. The  IPCC Bureau, composed of 30 members elected by the Panel, assists  the IPCC Chair in planning, coordinating and monitoring progress  in the work of the IPCC.

### KEY IPCC PRODUCTS

The IPCC completed its initial comprehensive  assessments of climate change in the First Assessment Report in  1990 and the Second Assessment Report in 1995. The IPCC's Third  Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001, addresses policy- relevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic dimensions of  climate change, and concentrates on findings since 1995 at both  regional and global levels. The TAR, which was subject to  extensive review from experts and governments, is composed of a  comprehensive assessment from the three IPCC Working Groups, a  Summary for Policy Makers (SPM), a Technical Summary of each  Working Group report, and a Synthesis Report. The TAR Synthesis  Report is written in a non-technical style aimed at policy makers,  and discusses nine policy-relevant questions identified by the  IPCC based on submissions by governments. The IPCC's Fourth  Assessment Report (AR4) is due to be released in 2007.

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories were  first released in 1994, and a revised set was completed in 1996.  In 2000 and 2003, the Panel approved additional good practice  guidance reports that complement the Revised 1996 Guidelines and,  in 2003, approved a process for a further revision of the  Guidelines by early 2006.

### NINETEENTH SESSION

At IPCC-19, held from 17-20 April 2002, in  Geneva, Switzerland, the IPCC began work on the AR4. The Panel  took a number of decisions, including in relation to a draft  workplan for developing definitions for forest degradation and  devegetation, methodological options for recording and reporting  on emissions from these activities, and aspects of the procedures  for agreeing on NGGIP products. Delegates also decided: on the  timing of the AR4; to hold a workshop on geological and oceanic  carbon dioxide separation, capture and storage; to draft a scoping  paper on climate change and water; and to hold an expert meeting  on climate change and development.

### TWENTIETH SESSION

IPCC-20 was held from 19-21 February 2003, in  Paris, France. Delegates agreed on a workplan for two expert  scoping meetings on the structure of the AR4. They discussed a  framework and a set of criteria for establishing priorities for  special reports, methodology reports and technical papers for the  period of the fourth assessment. The Panel also decided to hold a  high-level scientific meeting to survey the processes affecting  terrestrial carbon stocks and human influences upon them, and to  produce two special reports: one on safeguarding the ozone layer  and the global climate system; and the other on carbon dioxide  capture and storage.

### TWENTY-FIRST SESSION

At IPCC-21, held from 3-7 November 2003, in  Vienna, Austria, delegates reviewed the outlines of the proposed  Working Group contributions to the AR4 and the Chair's proposal  for an AR4 Synthesis Report. The Panel agreed that a technical  paper on climate change and water should be completed in 2007,  discussed terms of reference for a document on the AR4 product  set, and reviewed the report of the IPCC expert meeting on  processes affecting terrestrial carbon stocks and human influences  on them. Delegates also approved the terms of reference for  reviewing the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories, and agreed on a revised mandate and changed the  name of the Task Group on Scenarios for Climate and Impacts  Assessment to Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact  and Climate Analysis (TGICA).

### TWENTY-SECOND SESSION

IPCC-22 convened from 9-11 November 2004,  in New Delhi, India. Delegates discussed, inter alia, the scope,  content and process for an AR4 Synthesis Report, AR4 products,  outreach, and election procedures. The Panel agreed to work  towards a 30-page AR4 Synthesis Report with a five-page SPM to be  approved by the IPCC in late October 2007.

### TWENTY-THIRD SESSION

At IPCC-23, which convened on 8 April 2005,  in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, delegates considered the joint  activities of Working Groups I and II on the Special Report on  Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System. The  Panel accepted this Special Report along with an SPM. In adopting  the draft report of IPCC-22, delegates also agreed that the IPCC  Bureau would further consider arrangements for management of the  AR4 Synthesis Report and report back on its progress.

### TWENTY-FOURTH SESSION

IPCC-24 was held from 26-28 September 2005,  in Montreal, Canada. Delegates approved the Special Report on  Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage and the SPM and discussed  management of the AR4 Synthesis Report, further work on aerosols  and on emission scenarios, outreach activities and admittance of  observer organizations. The Panel did not, however, reach  agreement on revised election procedures for the IPCC Bureau and  any Task Force Bureau. Delegates also decided to establish a Task  Group on New Emission Scenarios (TGNES), with a lifetime up to  IPCC-25, to further define the emission scenarios development  process.

# IPCC-25 REPORT

IPCC-25 opened on Wednesday, 26 April 2006. During the three-day  meeting, delegates met in plenary, informally and in contact  groups to make progress on the agenda items, including: acceptance  of the 2006 Guidelines and adoption of its Overview Chapter;  approval of the programme and budget for 2006-09; adoption of the  IPCC-24 draft report, rules of procedures for election of the IPCC  Bureau and any Task Force Bureau, and a policy and process for  admitting observer organizations. Delegates also discussed other  issues, including outreach, matters relating to the UNFCCC and  progress reports on IPCC activities.

S.N. Sok Appadu, Mauritius Meteorological Service, opened the  session and welcomed delegates. In thanking Mauritius for hosting  the meeting, IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri (India) noted the  importance to Mauritius of assessing climate change because of  potential sea level rise and the role of agriculture in its  economy. He highlighted the benefits of holding IPCC meetings in  different locations, including the opportunity for IPCC members to  interact with local scientific and governmental experts.

Hong Yan, Deputy Secretary-General, WMO, said the IPCC has become  an authoritative voice on the science of climate change and added  that several decisions taken at the eleventh Conference of the  Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 11) and the first Conference of the  Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (COP/MOP 1) were based on IPCC findings. He also  indicated the readiness of WMO bodies to cooperate with the IPCC.

Alexander Alusa, Division for Environmental Conventions, UNEP,  underscored UNEP's intention to support the IPCC in disseminating  the results of the AR4 as widely as possible and noted that UNEP's  Information Unit for Conventions is already disseminating the  Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage.

Halldor Thorgeirsson, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC, noted  important areas for the interplay of science and policy, such as  the five-year programme of work on adaptation of the UNFCCC's  Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)  and the proposal under the UNFCCC to address emissions from  deforestation. Thorgeirsson drew attention to the reference to the  IPCC in the COP's decision on long-term cooperative action on  climate change under the UNFCCC and stressed the IPCC's role in  directly influencing national positions.

Anil Bachoo, Minister of Environment and National Development Unit  of Mauritius, urged the IPCC to provide regionally relevant  information to developing countries and cautioned that the full  impacts of climate change on the ecosystems of small island  developing states may not be appreciated, due to lack of  information and scientific research.

Delegates approved the agenda for the meeting (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 1,  Rev. 1) as well as the draft report of IPCC-24 (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 2).  The draft report of IPCC-24 summarizes when and how each agenda  item was addressed during the meeting. It also includes, in  separate annexes: the meeting agenda as approved; the list of  participants; and decisions taken on the programme and budget for  2006-08, the draft rules of procedures for the election of the  IPCC Bureau and any Task Force Bureau, and new emission scenarios.

# IPCC PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2006-09

This item was discussed in plenary on Wednesday and Friday, and in  meetings of the Financial Task Team (FTT), held Wednesday through  Friday. On Friday, the Panel adopted the 2007 budget, after adding  journeys for developing country experts for the 2007 meeting on  new emission scenarios (see page 4) and after deleting funding for  the scoping meeting on renewable energy (see page 6). The Panel  also took note of the forecast budget for 2008 and the indicative  budget for 2009, and adopted a decision on these matters.

In introducing the IPCC programme and budget for 2006-09 (IPCC- XXV/Doc. 3 and IPCC-XXV/Doc. 3, Add. 1), IPCC Secretary Renate  Christ emphasized that any decisions taken at IPCC-25 need to be  reflected in the budgets for future years. With Chair Pachauri,  she stressed the need for governments to make their financial  contributions for 2006.

In the meetings of the FTT, co-chaired by Marc Gillet (France) and  Zhenlin Chen (China), discussions centered on the reasons for the  budgetary carry over, which include cancellation, postponement,  and back-to-back scheduling of some meetings, as well as  contributions to meeting costs by host countries; incorporating  plenary decisions in the 2007 budget, including funding for new  emission scenarios; and requests for budgetary adjustments from  Technical Support Units and other IPCC groups based on their  revised meeting plans.

###     Final Decision

In the decision on the budget, the Panel:thanks the IPCC Chair and the IPCC Secretary for their  efforts to improve the presentation of the programme and budget; encourages the Secretariat to continue to make improvements  by providing more detail in the presentation of its past and  projected expenses, and to examine the issue of constant over- estimation in the budget and work towards accurate forecasting; adopts the budget for 2007; notes the forecast budget for 2008 and the indicative budget  for 2009; thanks the US government for its special contribution to the  translation and publication of the 2006 Guidelines into the five  UN languages other than English; recognizes that a certain amount of carry over is necessary  to ensure continuation of the IPCC programme of work and the  transition to the next assessment period, and that the carry over  may vary from year to year, due to the cyclical nature of the  assessment; and invites governments that may be in a position to do so to  contribute to the IPCC Trust Fund.

# 2006 GUIDELINES

The draft 2006 Guidelines and its Overview Chapter (IPCC-XXV/Doc.  4a and IPCC-XXV/Doc. 4b) were addressed in plenary and in several  contact and drafting group meetings on Wednesday and Thursday.  Informal question and answer sessions with the Coordinating Lead  Authors were also held during the lunch break on Wednesday and on  Thursday. On Thursday evening, delegates considered the text of  the Overview Chapter section by section. After several revisions  and editorial changes, delegates adopted the Overview Chapter and  accepted the 2006 Guidelines.

Co-Chair of the Bureau of the Task Force on National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories (TFB) Thelma Krug (Brazil) introduced the draft  2006 Guidelines to the plenary on Wednesday, together with a new  document (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 4b, Add. 1) containing revisions to the  text resulting from comments by governments. Following a request  by the Russian Federation, the Secretariat prepared printed copies  of all government comments and made them available on Thursday  morning (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 4b, Add. 1, Rev. 1).

Delegates discussed certain technical issues in the 2006  Guidelines, including methods to estimate emissions from flooded  lands. On this issue, Brazil expressed reservations about  accepting the 2006 Guidelines as drafted, given concerns about the  method used to estimate emissions from flooded lands in the  wetlands chapter of the volume on Agriculture, Forestry and Other  Land Use (AFOLU). Austria and Norway supported Brazil's  reservation and cautioned against possible inconsistencies in the  methods when used at the project level. Canada noted that the  section on flooded lands represented a prudent compromise, while  the US cautioned against further changes to the document, stating  that the 2006 Guidelines were designed as a comprehensive package  and underscoring the danger of deleting sections or relegating  them to appendices. At issue were possible differences in the  carbon stock change and the flux method to calculate emissions  from flooded lands and the potential for overestimating or double  counting. This was resolved in contact and drafting group  discussions by using pertinent sections of the IPCC Good Practice  Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) on  the stock change method and referring to the flux method in an  appendix.

China proposed deletion of a reference to spontaneous combustion  in the volume on energy, stating that this represents a natural  phenomenon and not an anthropogenic source. After discussion with  the Coordinating Lead Authors, the reference to 'spontaneous'  combustion was changed to 'uncontrolled' combustion. Discussions  informally and in the lunchtime question and answer sessions also  led to the resolution of other technical issues, including the  concern of Denmark regarding the section on absorption of carbon  dioxide by concrete, contained in the volume on industrial  processes and product use.

After these technical issues were resolved, delegates proceeded to  consider the Overview Chapter section by section. Argentina,  supported by Saudi Arabia and the Russian Federation, and opposed  by Austria, Peru, Switzerland and the US, suggested that  methodologies be referred to as revised methodologies. Argentina  asked to have this request noted in the report of the meeting.  Discussion also centered on text on, inter alia, multi-year  averaging in the AFOLU sector, the relationship of the 2006  Guidelines to the Emission Factor Database (EFDB), and the policy  relevance of the 2006 Guidelines. After various minor editorial  changes and revisions, delegates adopted the Overview Chapter and  accepted the 2006 Guidelines.

###     Final Outcome

The Overview Chapter to the 2006 Guidelines adopted  by the Panel includes five sections: introduction; coverage of the  2006 Guidelines; approach to developing the 2006 Guidelines;  structure of the 2006 Guidelines; specific developments in the  2006 Guidelines; and relevance of the 2006 Guidelines.

The 2006 Guidelines accepted by the Panel comprise five volumes,  one of which provides general guidance on reporting, and four of  which focus on different sectors of economy: energy; industrial  processes and product use; AFOLU; and waste.

# FURTHER WORK ON EMISSION SCENARIOS

This item was discussed in plenary on Wednesday and Friday, and in  contact group, co-chaired by Ismail Elgizouli (Sudan) and Jean- Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium), and informal meetings on Wednesday  through Friday. Discussions proceeded from the recommendations of  the TGNES (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 11) and proposals contained within a  letter to Chair Pachauri from John Mitchell, Met Office, UK,  suggesting the selection of no more than two or three 'benchmark'  emissions trajectories for future climate change studies (IPCC- XXV/INF. 6). The Panel accepted a proposal for further work on  emission scenarios on Friday afternoon.

Throughout much of the discussion, delegates were divided as to  what the role of the IPCC should be in relation to further work on  emission scenarios. Australia joined the US in stressing that the  IPCC's role be limited to assessment of emission scenarios while  Germany, the Netherlands, and others supported a broader  coordination role for the IPCC. The US emphasized the overriding  importance of the IPCC's credibility in assessment, arguing that a  separation of function could not be maintained if the IPCC engaged  in a joint, interactive process of scenario development with the  climate modeling community. Saudi Arabia expressed concern that it  would be inappropriate to take decisions on future work during the  approval process of the AR4.

The timeliness of any decision on further work by the IPCC, for  the purposes of alerting the scientific community in preparation  for a fifth assessment report, was also considered important by  many delegates, given the time lag between the start and end of  any new scientific work. Similarly, delegates noted that those  involved in impacts and vulnerability scenario activities need  time to follow up from the results of scientific studies. In  addition, the US emphasized the important role of those who fund  scientific research.

###     How to address further work on emission scenarios

The UK  suggested that a new task group could be created to start liaising  with other bodies, to consider the regionalization of scenarios  and to decide how best to engage developing country experts. There  was debate about whether or not a new task group with a broad  mandate might create uncertainty. While some delegates suggested  designing a process for further work on emission scenarios, the US  proposed that a single IPCC meeting be held in 2007 to address the  issue. The Panel ultimately agreed to hold a single meeting. It  was agreed that a steering committee would be formed to organize  the 2007 meeting.

###     Technical Paper

Discussions also addressed the possibility of a  Technical Paper for consideration at IPCC-26 in May 2007. Saudi  Arabia argued that a Technical Paper was unnecessary as the  current emission scenarios are sufficient. Delegates decided a  scoping document should be prepared for a Technical Paper that  would summarize relevant material from the AR4 and identify, on  the basis of technical information provided, a small number of  'benchmark' emission scenarios for potential use by climate  modeling groups.

###     Developing country participation

China, Peru and others expressed  concerns about whether the incorporation of developing country  experts in the process of new emission scenarios development could  be ensured. Delegates concluded that this issue would be discussed  more fully at the meeting to be held in 2007. The Co-Chairs of the  contact group also requested funding from the Panel for 50  journeys for experts from developing countries and countries with  economies in transition to attend the proposed meeting, and the  Panel agreed that this support would come from the IPCC Trust Fund.

###     Final Outcome

On further work on emission scenarios, the Panel  agreed to:recognize that the development of scenarios for a fifth  assessment report would be undertaken by the scientific community  and that the IPCC may catalyze such work; call for the IPCC Chair, assisted by the Working Group  Co-Chairs, to prepare a scoping document for a Technical Paper  following the release of the AR4; request that the IPCC Chair form a steering committee to  organize an IPCC meeting in 2007, to be attended by members of the  TGICA and the former TGNES, and the Co-Chairs of the three Working  Groups or their representatives; hold a meeting in 2007 to consider: the desirable and  feasible characteristics of emission scenarios including  consistency, comparability, transparency, and the enhancement of  developing country involvement; information exchange on plans for  developing scenarios and coordinating activities among the  scientific community; enhancing the involvement of developing  countries and countries with economies in transition in scenario  development; and relevant issues for the assessment of scenarios;  and request the IPCC Chair send a letter one year before the  meeting in 2007 to groups involved in the development of scenarios  inviting them to provide information on plans and activities  supporting coordination.

# ELECTION PROCEDURES

The item on the draft rules of procedures for the election of the  IPCC Bureau and any Task Force Bureau (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 5) was  discussed in plenary on Thursday, when Secretary Christ recalled  that delegates agreed to the content of all rules at IPCC-24  except for Rule 20, the bracketed text of which states that  nominations for the position of the IPCC Chair, the IPCC Bureau  and any Task Force Bureau are to be made by the government of a  member of the IPCC. Delegates agreed to remove the brackets and  accept Rule 20 as drafted and adopted the rules of procedures with  minor editorial changes, including renumbering Rule 20 to come  before Rule 18 on the qualifications of nominees.

Discussion centered on the meaning of Rule 20, in particular,  whether individuals must be nominated by the government of their  own country. Emphasizing the IPCC's position as an  intergovernmental organization and that individuals must represent  their own countries, the Russian Federation expressed support for  removing the brackets around Rule 20, as did others, including  Argentina, Austria, Saudi Arabia, France, the US, China, and  Kenya. Switzerland noted that the IPCC works on several levels in  terms of scientific and governmental representation and  highlighted the mobility of the scientific community. Sri Lanka  suggested that the interpretation of Rule 20 as understood by  plenary, being that individuals must be nominated by the  government of their own countries, should be recorded.

###     Final Outcome

The rules of procedures for the election of the  IPCC Bureau and any Task Force Bureau adopted by the Panel include  rules relating to: the composition of the IPCC Bureau and any Task  Force Bureau, including composition with regard to geographical  representation; terms of appointment; general principles of  elections; nominations; voting procedures; and amendments and  suspensions.

# COMMUNICATIONS STRATEGY AND OUTREACH

IPCC Secretary Christ introduced this item in plenary on Friday,  presenting a document on IPCC communications strategy and outreach  (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 6) and a compilation of government submissions  (IPCC-XXV/INF. 3 and IPCC-XXV/INF. 3, Add. 1). She noted a general  consensus that informing the public should not be the IPCC's key  focus, but that the Panel should ensure that the AR4 is initially  well diffused and translated quickly.

The ensuing discussion showed broad support for the proposed  strategy. Spain, Colombia and others noted the importance of  outreach activities in developing countries. Susan Solomon (US),  Working Group I Co-Chair, supported by the US and Canada, said  that outreach processes need to be clearly separated from the  substantive products to ensure the integrity of the IPCC. Several  countries cited the need to engage national organizations in  outreach activities.

Chair Pachauri concluded this item by summarizing plans for  dissemination of AR4 products and noted appreciation for the  offers of collaboration with national outreach bodies and  Secretary Christ noted that the Secretariat would take delegates'  comments on outreach and communications activities into account.

# POLICY AND PROCESS FOR ADMITTING OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS

A revised policy and process for admitting observer organizations  (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 7, Rev. 1) was discussed in plenary on Thursday and  Friday, along with several background documents, including the  compilation of comments by governments and organizations (IPCC- XXV/INF. 1), the summary of information provided by organizations  (IPCC-XXV/INF. 2) and brief information about organizations that  did not respond to the Secretariat's request for information  (IPCC-XXV/INF. 4*). The revised policy and process was adopted on  Friday.

Delegates discussed the role of the IPCC Bureau, the IPCC Chair  and the Panel itself in deciding upon applications. The US,  supported by Austria, suggested that the IPCC Bureau should not  have any formal decision-making authority in approving observer  organizations. Australia suggested that admittance of observer  organizations be at the discretion of the IPCC Chair. Kenya  cautioned against a rule that would allow an organization to be  admitted as an observer unless at least one-third of the IPCC  members present at a session object, stating that this could lead  to the first instance of decision making via voting by the IPCC.  The Panel agreed to change this rule so that an organization will  be admitted as an observer by the Panel by consensus.

Delegates also discussed issues relating to the revocation and  review of an organization's status. Morocco, supported by the UK,  queried how an observer organization might have its status  revoked. Regarding the proposal that any organization accepted as  an observer may retain that status so long as it continues to  satisfy the conditions under which it was admitted and that  observer status can be withdrawn for any reason at the discretion  of the IPCC Chair, the Panel agreed to Kenya's proposal that the  IPCC Chair may suspend an organization's status as an observer,  pending ratification by the Panel at its next session.

China, echoed by Saudi Arabia and Iraq, said it should be  necessary for applicant organizations to first obtain approval  from their national governments.

###     Final Outcome

The policy for admitting observer organizations  adopted by the Panel provides that, inter alia:organizations that already have obtained observer status in  the WMO, UNEP or the UNFCCC are not required to submit additional  documentation and are considered observers of the IPCC, subject to  acceptance by the Panel, if they so request; observer organizations need to be non-profit and/or tax- exempt organizations; and observer status does not imply admission or invitation to  workshops, expert meetings or other closed meetings.

The process for admitting observer organizations adopted by the  Panel provides that, inter alia:groups interested in observer status should post a letter of  application with copies of: documents describing the mandate of  the organization; evidence of non-profit and/or tax-exempt status;  other information supporting the organization's competence in  matters related to the IPCC; information on the affiliation with  other non-government organizations or institutions involved in  climate change activities; and contact information; a body is admitted as an observer organization by the Panel  by consensus; no funding will be available for observer organizations; and an organization's status as an observer can be suspended by  the IPCC Chair, pending ratification by the Panel at its next  session.

# TFI FUTURE WORK PROGRAMME

This issue was discussed in plenary on Thursday. TFB Co-Chair Taka  Hiraishi (Japan) presented the future TFI work programme (IPCC- XXV/Doc. 10), noting the work of the NGGIP on the EFDB, and its  plan to develop computer software implementing the Tier 1 methods  of the 2006 Guidelines. He also referred to the NGGIP's plan to  prepare, as part of its outreach activities, a brochure about the  2006 Guidelines and a compilation of frequently asked questions  and answers, to contribute to training courses and to hold a  meeting of inventory experts at the end of 2006 to develop a draft  future workplan.

Discussion centered on the longer-term topics needing further  expert consideration outlined in the future work programme and on  capacity building for developing countries. Switzerland, with  Austria and Norway, highlighted the importance of satellite and  other remote sensing measurements, while Brazil noted concerns  about the proposal to consider areas where inventory science is in  a relatively early stage of development, such as wetlands,  savannahs, and settlements, and the use of data from other  emissions accounting. Support for assisting developing countries  in inventories work was widely expressed, including by Samoa,  Syria, Iran, Ghana, the Gambia, Sierra Leone and Kenya. The  Netherlands and the US called for broad participation in the  expert meeting.

###     Final Outcome

Delegates agreed that:they will support the proposal on the future TFI work  programme, which includes a meeting of inventory experts in the  second half of 2006, that will involve 60 experts and the TFB  members; the output from the meeting will be a draft workplan, agreed  by the TFB, for consideration by the Panel; the topics to be discussed at the meeting will not be limited  to those outlined in the future workplan; and Chair Pachauri will write to the Government of Japan noting  its appreciation of Japan's support for the work of the TFI.

# PROPOSAL FOR AN IPCC SPECIAL REPORT ON RENEWABLE ENERGY

This proposal for a Special Report on Renewable Energy (IPCC- XXV/Doc. 12), which was presented by Germany and supported by  Austria, Belgium, Denmark, the Gambia, Greece, Spain, Sweden and  the Netherlands, was discussed in plenary on Friday. The Panel  agreed to hold a scoping meeting on the Special Report in 2007.

In presenting the proposal, Germany noted that renewable energy is  dealt with only briefly in the AR4, and that, together with energy  efficiency, renewable energy sources and technologies represent a  major mitigation option that remains to be addressed in depth.  Stressing that the Special Report need not have a narrow  technological focus, she emphasized energy efficiency as an  overarching theme and drew attention to the relationship between  renewable energy and sustainable development, energy transition  pathways and technology transfer. On a possible process and  timeline, Germany suggested holding a scoping meeting after  approval of the three Working Group reports for the AR4 so as not  to interfere with the AR4 process or with possible preparations  for a fifth assessment. She added that to avoid resource  bottlenecks and overstretching of the IPCC budget, Germany  intended to support the organization of this scoping meeting.

Most countries supported the proposal, with many emphasizing the  value and urgency of such a review for developing countries.  Egypt, with various others, suggested expanding the scope of the  Special Report to include energy efficiency. The UK noted a range  of possible topics for a Special Report, in particular the  function of capital markets in energy investment, and, with France  and Switzerland, preferred postponing deliberation of this until  the next IPCC session to allow for further consideration. Saudi  Arabia, China and the US said the proposal was premature given  limited human and financial resources. Working Group III Co-Chair  Ogunlade Davidson (Sierra Leone) said that more specific analyses  of renewable energy sources would benefit a larger number of  countries, expressed support for the proposal given its  comprehensiveness and, underscoring that energy efficiency and  renewable energy are considerably different, advised against  combining them in one Special Report.

Noting the extent of support for the proposal, Chair Pachauri  proposed to hold the scoping meeting towards the end of 2007 after  the scheduled completion of the AR4 and to submit the results to  the Panel in late 2008. The US said it was not in a position to  provide funding for this and could not guarantee participation.  Germany restated its willingness to provide funding for the  scoping meeting but that it could not yet confirm that this will  include travel funding. The Panel concluded that Germany and other  interested countries would be responsible for organizing financial  support for travel costs.

###     Final Outcome

The IPCC agreed to hold a scoping meeting on a  possible Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources in late 2007.

###     MATTERS RELATED TO the UNFCCC

This item was discussed in plenary on Friday. Secretary Christ  provided an overview of the decisions taken at COP 11 and COP/MOP  1, as well as at SBSTA 23 (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 9). Halldor Thorgeirsson,  Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC, updated delegates on informal  consultations held in Vienna from 13-15 March 2006, on elaboration  of the five-year programme of work on impacts, vulnerability and  adaptation to climate change, which will provide input to SBSTA's  scoping of activities for the initial phase of the five-year  programme of work. He also explained that SBSTA is turning its  attention to research needs, including efforts to stimulate global  climate change research and the participation of developing  countries in research. Documents on the informal consultations in  Vienna and on SBSTA's consideration of research needs are  available on the UNFCCC web site.

After the Russian Federation stressed that the 2006 Guidelines  should be incorporated into the UNFCCC process, Thorgeirsson noted  that the 2006 Guidelines will be an agenda item at SBSTA 24.  Austria asked whether there were likely to be requests for IPCC  contributions to the five-year programme of work on adaptation,  and Thorgeirsson responded that while no new requests are  anticipated at this time, more interaction between the IPCC and  UNFCCC is expected as the AR4 moves forward.

# PROGRESS REPORTS

Progress reports on activities of the three Working Groups and  TGICA were considered in plenary on Thursday. Delegates also heard  updates on the Editorial Board of the EFDB and the AR4 Synthesis  Report.

###     Working Group I

Working Group I Co-Chair Solomon presented on  progress towards the AR4 (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 13). She noted that the  next IPCC Bureau should consider revising the IPCC rules and  procedures concerning reviews, given the emergence of new  electronic media.

###     Working Group II

Martin Parry (UK), Working Group II Co-Chair,  presented on progress towards the AR4 (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 15). He  agreed that the IPCC rules and procedures should be reviewed, but  added that the next IPCC Bureau should also consider the way in  which the Working Groups work with scientists more generally.  Delegates agreed that once the AR4 is completed, a small group of  IPCC members could develop a document to provide guidance to the  next IPCC Bureau on IPCC review procedures.

###     Working Group III

Working Group III Co-Chair Davidson presented  on progress towards the AR4 (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 18), highlighting media  attention on the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and  Storage.

###     AR4 Synthesis Report

Chair Pachauri informed the Panel that the  core writing team for the AR4 Synthesis Report (IPCC-XXV/INF. 5)  had been presented to the IPCC Bureau and that the first meeting  of the team will be held in approximately three months.

### TGICA

Co-Chair of TGICA, Jose Marengo (Brazil), provided a  progress report on the activities of the TGICA (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 14),  including an overview of its 11th session, held in Cape Town,  South Africa, from 7-9 February 2006.

### EFDB

TGICA Co-Chair Hiraishi provided the Panel with details on  the new and continuing members of the EFDB Editorial Board, as  well as the geographic distribution of members (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 16).

# REVIEW OF THE IPCC TERMS OF REFERENCE

This item was introduced to plenary on Thursday, when Secretary  Christ explained that, at its 14th session in 2003, the WMO  Congress encouraged the IPCC to review its own terms of reference,  as set out in a background document (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 8). After  plenary discussions on Thursday and Friday and informal  discussions on Thursday evening, delegates agreed to a list of  people to assist Chair Pachauri with a small-scale review of the  IPCC's terms of reference that could be considered at IPCC-26.

In plenary, discussions centered on the timing of a review, in  light of ongoing IPCC work towards the AR4 and the schedule for  future meetings of the WMO Congress, and whether an extensive  review of the terms of reference is necessary. Austria suggested  that now may not be the appropriate time for a substantial review  of the rules, while China proposed that 2008, being the start of  the new IPCC Bureau and after the release of the AR4, might be an  appropriate time. Noting that the IPCC's terms of reference have  served the organization well, Australia, with support from  Switzerland, the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Germany, Peru and  others, suggested that a short-term review by a small team working  with the IPCC Chair might be preferable to a lengthier review at  this time. Kenya suggested that a review might include  consideration of active work with the scientific community in  areas of comparative advantage and capacity building in developing  countries, and Australia, with Chair Pachauri, noted that some  scope for capacity building exists within the current terms of  reference.

###     Final Outcome

The Panel agreed that:a small team of delegates will work with Chair Pachauri and  the Secretariat to conduct a review of the terms of reference for  consideration at IPCC-26; if acceptable to the Panel, the review could be presented by  Chair Pachauri on behalf of the IPCC to the next session of the  WMO Congress in 2007; and the review will be conducted primarily via electronic means  as a meeting is not likely to be necessary.

# CLOSING PLENARY

Secretary Christ outlined the dates and locations of future IPCC  meetings (see page 9). Chair Pachauri thanked the Government of  Mauritius, the Secretariat, delegates and participants, and  gaveled the meeting to a close at 5:47 pm.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF IPCC-25

Since its inception, the IPCC has been a key component of the  climate change regime. Its work, most notably its assessment  reports, has raised the profile of climate change on the  international agenda and is a foundation upon which the UNFCCC and  the Kyoto Protocol have undertaken their work.

The reason the IPCC has been able to create assessment and other  reports that policy-makers in many parts of the world find useful  is a result of its unique nature, notably its truly broad  composition incorporating both developed and developing countries,  and both scientists and policy makers.

As the IPCC moves forward with its Fourth Assessment Report (AR4),  attention has begun to turn to the possibility that a fifth  assessment report might follow, and the Panel is considering what  research and tools might be necessary to undertake it. This, in  turn, raises the question of what the IPCC is and should be, and  has reopened the debate between those countries that wish to  restrict the role of the IPCC to one of simply an assessor of  information and those who want it to take a more proactive role in  climate change science.

This analysis considers the emerging tension over the IPCC's  future role during the debate on new emission scenarios through  the lens of its past experience. It suggests that the discussion  on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas  Inventories (2006 Guidelines) illustrates the value of  capitalizing on the unique nature of the IPCC and that the final  proposal for the IPCC's involvement in further work on new  emission scenarios ensures that the experiences gained by the IPCC  over the last 18 years will not be lost.

# 2006 GUIDELINES

The discussion on the 2006 Guidelines was slowed down at the  outset by an unusual request from Russia for the IPCC Secretariat  to make available in print form all government comments on the  draft 2006 Guidelines (which amounted to over 200 pages), and the  clear objection of Brazil to the treatment of flooded lands in the  volume on AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use).  Anticipating that the debate over accepting the 2006 Guidelines  would be drawn out, interpreters were secured in advance to be  available until 1:00 am on the second day of the meeting. Yet  shortly after 11:00 pm that night, delegates were congratulating  the Coordinating Lead Authors and each other on the adoption of  this major piece of work.

Initiated following an invitation by the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Subsidiary Body for  Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) in 2002 to revise the  1996 Guidelines by 2006, the new Guidelines amount to five volumes  incorporating hundreds of pages. These volumes represent the  largest body of work ever presented to the IPCC plenary for  acceptance and are based on the experience of countries dating  back to the late 1980s, by which time a significant number of  national greenhouse gas inventories had emerged. The 2006  Guidelines incorporate and improve on the methodologies and  guidance previously prepared by the IPCC for estimating national  inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by  sinks: the Revised 1996 Guidelines, the 2000 Good Practice  Guidance and Uncertainty Management, and the Good Practice  Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). They  also incorporate the experiences from the UNFCCC technical  inventory review process.

These Guidelines are the basis on which the climate change regime  rests, for they provide a credible and transparent reporting  framework that is of universal application for estimating  greenhouse gas emissions. They are the result of a solid process  of close interaction among the international scientific community  and policy makers and users.

In considering the final draft of the 2006 Guidelines for  acceptance at IPCC-25, debate focused on different interpretations  of what the best methodologies are for estimating emissions in  particular cases. Brazil considered that the carbon flux  methodology used in the chapter on wetlands for estimating  emissions from flooded lands, for example, could lead to  overestimations when applied in a tropical region. In contrast,  Canada felt that this methodology represented an improvement on  methodologies previously applied. Reaching consensus required some  negotiation, and in the end, both the carbon stock change method  preferred by Brazil and flux method preferred by Canada were  included. It is this accommodation of the concerns of many  different countries in an open forum that makes the 2006  Guidelines in particular, and the IPCC process in general,  credible and useful.

# NEW EMISSION SCENARIOS

Of all the agenda items at the IPCC's twenty-fifth session,  further work on new emission scenarios was one of the most  important issues in defining the mandate of the IPCC. Before the  First Assessment Report was released in 1990, Working Group III  prepared the initial set of possible future greenhouse gas  emission scenarios that were used by Working Group I in assessing  future climate change. These scenarios, called the SA90 scenarios,  examined business as usual and three additional trajectories based  on assumed policies that would lead to reduced emissions.

In 1992, the SA90 scenarios were reviewed and six alternative  scenarios were developed that were subsequently evaluated in 1994.  In 1996, the Panel decided that a new set of scenarios was needed.  This most recent set of scenarios, initially published in 1998, is  still widely used by researchers. The projections of the future  atmospheric composition and climate based on these scenarios were  assessed in the IPCC's Third Assessment Report. The assessment of  emission scenarios in the scientific literature is an important  aspect of the AR4, which will be released in 2007. Preparations  are needed to ensure the readiness of an updated set of new  emission scenarios for use in a possible fifth assessment report.

At IPCC-25, the role that the IPCC should play with regard to this  process was highly debated. The US and Australia stressed the  importance of protecting the integrity of the IPCC by limiting its  role to one of assessing the available literature, with the  development of new emission scenarios taking place wholly within  the scientific community. Others, including Germany, the  Netherlands, Spain, and most developing countries, argued that the  IPCC should coordinate those efforts to ensure consistency,  comparability, transparency, and the participation of developing  country experts.

After extended debate, the Panel adopted a proposal by the Co- Chairs of the contact group on emission scenarios to produce a  scoping document for a technical paper that would summarize the  AR4 findings and identify a small number of benchmark scenarios  for potential use by climate modeling groups. The proposal  includes the organization of a meeting between the IPCC and  experts in 2007 to address this issue. There was also much  discussion on whether the IPCC 'may facilitate' or 'may  coordinate' this process in the scientific community. In the end,  the adopted proposal states that the IPCC 'may catalyze' such work.

# CAPITALIZING ON THE EXPERIENCE OF THE IPCC

The word 'catalyze' can have different meanings in plain English  and in chemistry. In chemistry, the catalyst remains unchanged as  it speeds reactions. The catalyst in real life is transformed in  the process of catalyzing by, if nothing else, the experience of  its actions. The IPCC now possesses 18 years of experience working  with scientists and policy-makers from many countries. It would be  a shame to lose the expertise that has been built by the IPCC, and  that might have been the case if the IPCC delegated the entire  process for scenario development to the scientific community to  organize itself. Instead, the IPCC will remain engaged in seeing  that the desired features and characteristics of scenarios are  incorporated and that these are ready for a fifth assessment report.

Had the IPCC washed its hands of any involvement beyond  assessment, it is unlikely that many developing country experts  would have been included in the process. Instead, the travel  funding for 50 scientists from developing countries and economies  in transition will ensure their participation at the new emission  scenarios meeting in 2007. In this regard, the discussion on  flooded lands under the 2006 Guidelines provides an example of how  important it is to include the views of different scientists from  different regions in any global analysis. Applying the same  approach to disparate regions may lead to bias in the results.  Addressing these differences in an open forum results in products  that can be both scientifically credible and politically approved  for widespread use.

The accumulated experience of the IPCC has resulted in a unique  organization that, although it has downsides, can provide valuable  advice on addressing the concerns of all countries or regions.  While its success is due in large part to a focused and limited  mandate, it would be unfortunate to not take full advantage of its  future potential and its past record of success.

Fortunately, the decision at IPCC-25 on emission scenarios does  not restrict the role of IPCC but offers the opportunity to  capitalize on its unique qualities. This, together with the  acceptance of universal applicability of the 2006 Guidelines,  demonstrates the belief of most that the IPCC, given its inclusive  nature, has an important role to play. This broad support is  crucial when addressing a global problem such as climate change,  the specific consequences of which are unpredictable but will  surely be felt by everyone everywhere.
