# SBI

SBI Chair Bagher Asadi (Iran) opened the session. On the agenda and organization of work ( FCCC/SBI/2008/1 ), Chair Asadi suggested leaving a sub-item on information contained in non-Annex I communications in abeyance until SBI 29. The EU said SBI is legally obliged to consider items on its agenda and the UMBRELLA GROUP expressed disappointment that the matter would not be discussed at SBI 28. However, both agreed to the suggestion, and parties adopted the agenda as proposed.

## OPENING STATEMENTS:

A number of speakers commented on technology, adaptation and financial matters. The G-77/CHINA highlighted the fourth review of the financial mechanism and requested an update on operationalization of the Adaptation Fund. He expressed disappointment with the GEF strategic programme on investment for technology transfer, and urged a renewed mandate for the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I National Communications (CGE). The AFRICAN GROUP opposed proposals to provide loan financing, as opposed to grants, to developing countries. Maldives, for LDCs, complained of funding delays for implementing NAPAs. COLOMBIA proposed extending the levy on the CDM for adaptation to the other mechanisms.

## NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS - CGE

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The High-Level Conference on World Food Security taking place in Rome was generating some talk in the corridors in Bonn, with a few delegates drawing connections to the post-2012 discussions, particularly regarding the role of biofuels. The excitement is all in Rome right now, said one negotiator, adding that a greater sense of urgency might be needed in Bonn to get through the heavy workload. Some delegates were also talking about financing issues. Several commented on the Adaptation Fund, Resource Allocation Framework, and funding for NAPA implementation - important issues for many developing countries and LDCs. There was also talk about the GEF s draft strategic programme, and speculation on how some developing country concerns with the financial mechanism might manifest themselves in the coming days. Looking further ahead, a growing number of participants were expressing concerns about the availability and cost of accommodation for COP 14 and COP/MOP 4 in Poznan, Poland, in December. I hope I don t end up sleeping in the snow in December! said one delegate, seemingly only partly in jest.
