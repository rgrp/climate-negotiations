# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### IPCC TAR

This group met in morning and evening sessions to  continue deliberations on the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions.  Several delegates opposed Co-Chair David Warrilow's suggestion  that Parties compile a list of provisional work-programme elements.  They stressed that before considering text on a work programme,  agreement was needed on whether to address scientific, technical  and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation and mitigation in one or  two SBSTA agenda items, and on the elements of the proposed work  programme. TUVALU, supported by AOSIS, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and  SWITZERLAND, suggested deleting reference to a 'work programme'  and replacing it with 'elements for future SBSTA work.' The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU, JAPAN and US, questioned the utility  of inter-sessional consultations on the TAR prior to SBSTA-19.  AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and the US said adaptation and mitigation  could be considered as separate agenda items. CANADA, the EU,  JAPAN and SWITZERLAND, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, preferred to  consider adaptation and mitigation under one agenda item.  Participants then discussed how adaptation and mitigation would be  considered in practice if these two issues were to be included in  one agenda item.

AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the EU, JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND, opposed by the  G-77/CHINA, stressed the importance of considering cross-cutting  elements and the integration of adaptation and mitigation. CANADA  and SWITZERLAND supported a proposal made by New Zealand  requesting SBSTA to explore the scientific, technological and  socioeconomic aspects of how adaptation and mitigation each link  to other issues, such as sustainable development and UNFCCC  Article 2 (objective). CANADA, the EU, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and US  underscored the importance of the timing of SBSTA activities.

SAUDI ARABIA noted that elements of future SBSTA work should  exclude adaptive and mitigative capacity, but include spill-over  effects. The EU suggested including, inter alia, no regrets  mitigation options and the stabilization of greenhouse gas  concentrations. The US opposed developing a list of specific  programme elements. Co-Chair David Warrilow said he would hold  informal consultations with several Parties.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

This contact group discussed draft  COP and COP/MOP decisions and their annexes. Regarding the draft  COP/MOP decision on technical guidance on methodologies for  adjustments under Article 5.2 (adjustments), the EU noted that  lead reviewers should not only recommend how data sources should  be updated, but also how they should be developed. On the criteria  for selecting lead reviewers, Parties discussed whether knowledge  of Annex I Party official languages other than the official UN  languages should be a desirable criteria for lead reviewers. The  G-77/CHINA, opposed by JAPAN, preferred deleting reference to  languages other than UN languages. Co-Chair Newton Paciornik said  informal consultations would continue to address the draft  decisions and conclusions.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Co-Chair Richard Muyungi introduced new  draft conclusions. SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA, objected to  text referring to information exchange among 'all Parties,' and to  text 'inviting Annex I Parties and other interested Parties' to  share information during informal round-tables. He also said that  the Co-Chairs' proposal of holding informal round-tables during  session time seemed unworkable. SAMOA said it did not share all of  the concerns expressed by Saudi Arabia. Following a short break  for consultations, the G-77/CHINA was unable to agree a united  position on the text. Co-Chair Muyungi then asked for delegates'  general views. The EU and JAPAN requested the deletion of text  calling for information exchange on ways to minimize adverse  effects of response measures. With the US, they encouraged further  discussion on the option of holding round-tables. Co-Chair Greg  Terrill adjourned the meeting to allow the G-77/China to consult  further on these issues.

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This group met to consider the Chair's draft  conclusions and the terms of reference (TOR) for the comprehensive  review of the implementation of the framework for capacity  building in developing countries. Delegates agreed to a proposal  by the G-77/China to request the Secretariat to prepare a  compilation paper on progress in implementing decision 2/CP.7  (capacity building in developing countries). CANADA suggested  including information from bilateral and multilateral  organizations. The US stressed the importance of taking into  account country-driven approaches. Given the limited time until  the review process, delegates agreed to request COP-9 to adopt a  decision extending the review until COP-10. They also agreed on  requesting the COP to adopt a decision reviewing decision 3/CP.7  (capacity building in EITs). On the TOR for the review, Parties  discussed the period for the review. The G-77/CHINA preferred  focusing on the period after COP-7, while CANADA and others noted  that capacity building was a long-term process that did not begin  at COP-7. Chair Dechen Tsering said that she would convene  informal consultations on the draft conclusions.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

This contact group met in afternoon  and evening sessions. Co-Chair Fadhel Lari introduced the Co- Chairs' draft conclusions as well as proposals from the EU and G-77/China. Delegates debated at length which document to use as the  basis for discussion. The G-77/CHINA said its proposal was an  initial one, as not all its members had been consulted. Opposed by  the US and EU, it suggested using the proposal as the basis for  discussion. Delegates agreed to proceed on the basis of the Co- Chairs' draft, and began working paragraph-by-paragraph.

There were divergent views over whether to delete reference to  'progress made,' with the G-77/CHINA preferring language  indicating that little or no progress has been made in  implementing decision 5/CP.7 (adverse effects). The US and EU  suggested stating that progress has been made through multilateral  and bilateral activities in the areas of information and  methodology, vulnerability and adaptation, as well as in convening  workshops and establishing the SCCF and LDC Fund. On the reports  of the workshops on insurance and risk assessment, delegates could  not agree on whether to address them in separate paragraphs.

Regarding the workshop on economic diversification, delegates  discussed how the TOR should be elaborated. The G-77/CHINA said  the process of submissions could delay the organization of the  workshop, noting that decision 5/CP.7 calls for it to be held  prior to COP-9. The Co-Chairs proposed compromise text requesting  the Secretariat to take into account the views expressed during  SB-18 in this regard.

Delegates revisited amendments proposed in the earlier session.  The Secretariat prepared a revised draft incorporating the  Parties' proposals. After a brief consideration of the revised  text, the group adjourned. The Co-Chairs will conduct informal  consultations and produce another revision for discussion at the  next meeting.

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND

Co-Chair Jaap Rooimans presented the  Co-Chairs' draft conclusions for discussion. On the SCCF's guiding  principles, the G-77/CHINA said that the Fund should be  complementary to the GEF climate focal areas, the LDC Fund, and  bilateral and multilateral funding, and maximize adaptation  funding opportunities for non-Annex I Parties not eligible for  support from the LDC Fund. He also emphasized that adaptation  projects should be recognized as having global benefits, and  small-scale projects should have expedited access through the  establishment of a small grants programme under the SCCF.  ARGENTINA, with the G-77/CHINA, said text proposing additional  submissions by Parties and an informal inter-sessional  consultation prior to SBI-19 would further postpone progress on  this matter. Noting its flexibility on these paragraphs, the EU  reiterated its support for a process to allow for the further  submission of Parties' views.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET

This contact group discussed a revised table,  which separates costs of preparatory and operational activities  under the Protocol and UNFCCC, and a revised draft decision. The  US sought clarification on the funding increase requested for  training inventory review experts. JAPAN, supported by AUSTRALIA,  requested specific calculations on funding dedicated to the  working capital reserve. The EU expressed concern about a possible  decision to adopt two indicative scales of assessment, and said,  if adopted, this decision would set a negative precedent for other  MEAs, since it would require Parties to pay for selected  activities related to a MEA and offer a perverse incentive for  those Parties who have not yet ratified the Protocol. Opposed by  the US, the EU then proposed two new options, which request  Parties to decide on only one instead of two indicative scales.  Under the first option, Parties would approve the budget for the  UNFCCC, including the preparatory activities related to the  Protocol, at the COP. Under the second option, Parties would  approve the budget for the UNFCCC at the COP, and adopt the budget  for preparatory activities relating to the Protocol at the COP/MOP.  The US proposed that Parties decide only on the biennial costs of  the UNFCCC, and not preparatory and operational costs associated  with the Protocol. The G-77/CHINA, ARGENTINA, and BRAZIL noted  that the new UN General Assembly scale of assessment should not be  applied automatically.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Several observers thought the heat must be getting to them as they  watched the P&Ms contact group undergo what seemed like its usual  last-minute meltdown. Some noted that one country's interventions  in the P&Ms contact group appeared to express 'more than a liberal  interpretation' of the G-77/China mandate. Though the contact  group will meet again, other observers suggested that 'there was  no hope' for agreement. Notwithstanding the divergence of views  within the G-77/China, several Parties to the Protocol have  concerns about exchanging information on ways to minimize the  adverse effects of response measures.
