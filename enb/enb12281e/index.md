# WELCOMING CEREMONY

The welcoming ceremony began with presentations from Gerald  Tremblay, Mayor of Montreal, and Jean Charest, Premier of Québec.  Mayor Tremblay highlighted the seriousness of the climate change  problem and the support of local governments for reducing  greenhouse gas emissions. Premier Charest noted Québec's support  for emissions reductions and the need for strong action to address  climate change. The speeches were followed by a live performance  highlighting the impacts of climate change.

# COP 11

### OPENING OF THE SESSION

COP 10 President Ginés González García  (Argentina) opened COP 11. He asked delegates to observe one  minute of silence in memory of UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke  Waller-Hunter, who passed away on 14 October 2005. Praising her  'tireless dedication and enthusiasm,' he said the best tribute  delegates could give would be to produce a strong outcome at  this meeting.

Parties then elected by acclamation Stéphane Dion, Canada's  Environment Minister, as President of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1. Dion  called for steps to 'implement, improve and innovate,' including  formally adopting the Marrakesh Accords and improving  implementation of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, including the  CDM. He also noted the need to begin consideration of commitments  after 2012.

UNFCCC Acting Executive Secretary Richard Kinley highlighted 2005  as a remarkable year for international climate policy, but drew  attention to new data showing an increase in Annex I emissions and  the need for further action.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

The COP agreed to apply the draft rules of  procedure, with the exception of draft rule 42 (voting), on which  President Dion said he would conduct informal consultations.

Parties then adopted the provisional agenda after agreeing to  remove the item on the second review of the adequacy of Article  4.2 (a) and (b) of the Convention. Regarding the organization of  work, the US emphasized the need for a clear separation between  Convention and Protocol issues. The COP agreed on the organization  of work as proposed by the President.

### OTHER MATTERS

Delegates then considered a draft decision relating  to adjustments under Protocol Article 5.2 (methodologies for  estimating emissions) (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/4/Add.1). President Dion  explained that this draft was part of a package of decisions that  had been recommended for adoption by COP/MOP 1. The COP adopted  the decision and forwarded it to COP/MOP 1.

### OPENING STATEMENTS

Several speakers highlighted technology  transfer and the five year programme of work on adaptation.  Jamaica, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern at the GEF  resource allocation framework. The UK, for the EU, called for an  'open mind' and 'creative and innovative ways' to address climate  change after 2012. Kenya, for the AFRICA GROUP, noted an  inadequate commitment on capacity building, while Bangladesh, on  behalf of the LDCs, highlighted the need to operationalize the  LDC, Adaptation and Special Climate Change Funds.

# COP/MOP 1

Late Monday morning, President Dion declared the COP/MOP open.  Regarding the provisional agenda, the UK, for the EU, opposed by  SAUDI ARABIA, objected to the inclusion of agenda item 10 on  Article 2.3 (response measures) on the grounds that it is  addressed elsewhere. However, the agenda was adopted as presented.

### OPENING STATEMENTS

The EU looked forward to the adoption of the  Marrakesh Accords. On compliance, she said that after a COP/MOP  decision on compliance, the EU would be open to discussing an  amendment to the Protocol. She identified the need for more work  on CDM and guidance for the Adaptation Fund. She also stressed  that the EU is ready to start discussions under Article 3.9  (future commitments).

Tuvalu, speaking for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS),  called for future commitments under Article 3.9, and said efforts  to streamline CDM should not compromise its environmental  integrity.

# SBSTA

SBSTA Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya) opened the session and  introduced the provisional agenda. The US, opposed by AOSIS, the  EU and G-77/CHINA, requested removing agenda item 11(a) relating  to small island developing States (SIDS). The US also asked for  clarification on inclusion of item 10 (IPCC special report on  Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage). The agenda was provisionally  adopted pending informal consultations on these issues. Since  Libya is not yet a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, SBSTA Vice-Chair  Amjad Abdulla (Maldives) was invited to chair SBSTA for Protocol- related agenda items.

### ADAPTATION

Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) reported on  the informal workshop on the five-year programme of work on  adaptation held in Bonn in October 2005. Samoa, for the G-77/CHINA,  said many adaptation projects are at a mature stage for  implementation and depend only on funding. AOSIS, SUDAN, YEMEN and  others stressed the need to be action-oriented. SAUDI ARABIA, with  NIGERIA and KUWAIT but opposed by ARGENTINA, CHILE and others,  called for consideration of adaptation to response measures and  inclusion of economic diversification in the programme of work.  JAPAN proposed a focus on methodologies and impact assessments and  the US suggested taking stock of existing efforts and engaging  experts. CANADA, supported by PERU and others, said that the  programme of work and SBI decisions to operationalize adaptation  funding represent an 'adaptation package,' and that it views a COP  decision endorsing a strong programme of work to be a goal of this  session. SBSTA Chair Benrageb asked Kumarsingh and Helen Plume  (New Zealand) to facilitate a contact group on this issue.

### MITIGATION

Delegates considered various reports on mitigation  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.5, FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.5 and Adds. 1-2), with  many Parties stressing the usefulness of the intersessional  workshops. CHINA and SOUTH AFRICA expressed concern about the  recent increase in greenhouse gas emissions by developed  countries. AUSTRALIA, CANADA, SWITZERLAND and others highlighted a  sectoral approach and a focus on 'key areas.' Areas mentioned  included renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture  and storage. AUSTRALIA underlined mitigation co-benefits. The EU  underscored the need to study implications of different  stabilization levels and emission pathways. Kok Seng Yap  (Malaysia) and Toshiyuki Sakamoto (Japan) will co-chair a  contact group.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Harvested Wood Products (HWP): Jenny Wong,  UNFCCC Secretariat, briefed delegates on HWP based on submissions  from Parties and national greenhouse gas inventories  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.7 and FCCC/SBSTA/2005/MISC.9). Parties noted  the complexity of HWP accounting and the need for further  consideration. Informal consultations will be conducted.

###     Common Reporting Format (CRF) for LULUCF

Delegates considered  documents containing Parties' views on the CRF tables  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/7 and FCCC/SBSTA/2005/MISC.7). Audun Rosland  (Norway) and Newton Paciornik (Brazil) will co-chair a contact  group.

Emissions from Fuel Used for International Aviation and Maritime  Transport: Jane Hupe, International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO), briefed SBSTA on ICAO's work on aviation emissions since  SBSTA 22. Chair Benrageb noted that consideration of this agenda  item had not been completed at SBSTA 22, and asked José Romero  (Switzerland) to hold informal consultations.

# SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

SBI Chair Thomas Becker (Denmark) opened  the session. On the agenda, the EU and AUSTRALIA questioned the  need to include a sub-item requested by Saudi Arabia on the Buenos  Aires programme of work on adaptation and response measures.  However, the agenda and organization of work were approved as  presented.

Chair Becker noted that consultations on officers for SBI 24 and  SBI 25 will be coordinated with the COP 11 and COP/MOP Bureau  consultations. The current SBI Bureau members will continue until  their successors are elected.

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Options for the Review Process: Vitaly Matsarski, UNFCCC  Secretariat, introduced a proposal for streamlining review  processes (FCCC/SBI/2005/16). The EU and JAPAN supported the  proposal, while the US expressed concern about eliminating  in-country in-depth reviews. Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) and  Dimitrios Lalas (Greece) will co-chair a contact group.

Report on National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data from Parties  Included in Annex I to the Convention for the Period 1990-2003:  Matsaraski introduced the compilation document (FCCC/SBI/2005/17).  Delegates agreed to take note of this information.

###     Status Report on the Review of Third National Communication

Matsaraski introduced the status report (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.9),  noting that the cycle of reviews for Third National Communications  is now completed. Delegates agreed to take note of the report.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Compilation and Synthesis of Initial  National Communications: Delegates considered compiled information  on non-Annex I national communications (FCCC/SBI/2005/18 and Adds.  1-6). BANGLADESH and the US said this information should be used  when donors assess the needs of non-Annex I countries.

Work of the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE) on non-Annex I  Communications: CGE Chair Emily Ojoo-Massawa briefed delegates on  training and support for non-Annex I national experts in 2005 and  2006, including regional workshops. INDONESIA announced its  interest in hosting a regional adaptation and vulnerability  assessment workshop. Several Parties appealed to Annex I countries  to provide resources. BANGLADESH said synergies between national  communications and National Adaptation Plans of Action should be  considered.

###     Provision of financial and technical support

Festus Luboyera,  UNFCCC Secretariat, introduced a document that lists projects  proposed by non-Annex I Parties for financing, as permitted under  UNFCCC Article 12.4 (FCCC/SBI/2005/Inf.8). Informal consultations  will be convened on non-Annex I communications.

### EDUCATION, TRAINING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS

Delegates were briefed  on various issues, including: the new UNFCCC Climate Change  Information Network (CC:iNet), an internet information clearing  house; regional workshops (FCCC/SBI/2005/21 and FCCC/SBI/2005/14);  and UNEP's work on Article 6. Crispin d'Auvergne (Saint Lucia)  will chair a contract group.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Janos Pasztor, SBI Coordinator, noted that  Decision 2/CP.10 requires SBI 24 to consider steps to be taken to  monitor regularly capacity building activities pursuant to  Decision 2/CP.7. Discussion centered on whether to create a  contact group and the extent to which such a contact group should  consider the GEF review on capacity building. Tanzania, for the  G-77/CHINA, stressed that a contact group was needed to develop  more guidance to the GEF, while the EU said discussion on the GEF  review should take place under the agenda item on the report by  the GEF. Joyceline Goco (Philippines) and Anders Turesson (Sweden)  will consult informally.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Most delegates arriving at the conference center on Monday morning  seemed in good humor despite the long lines to register and get  through security. In the corridors, much of the discussion was on  Canadian politics and what the implications of an election might  be on the conference. Several delegates said they were encouraged  by Minister Dion's statement committing himself to his work as COP  President, and that while the election campaign would be an  interesting backdrop to the meeting, it should not affect the  meeting outcome. One delegate noted, however, that it was not the  possible impacts on the next two weeks that bothered him, but  rather the possibility that Minister Dion might not be the COP  President after January.
