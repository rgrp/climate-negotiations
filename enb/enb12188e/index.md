# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

## STATEMENTS BY PARTIES

Delegates met in the morning and afternoon  to hear statements from 30 ministers and heads of delegation. Many  Parties supported ratification of the Protocol and its entry into  force in time for the WSSD in Johannesburg, and several  highlighted the growing scientific evidence provided by the IPCC  in support of urgent and stronger action on climate change. A  number of Parties also underscored the close links between climate  change and poverty.

On the negotiations at COP-7, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION emphasized  his concern with discussions on the development of rules and  modalities for accounting of emissions and removals by sinks, and  said working documents had become overloaded with technical  details. He said that simplification of reporting procedures was a  key issue for ratification. MALAYSIA said countries should not  reopen negotiations on the Bonn Agreements. On ratification of the  Protocol, NEW ZEALAND announced its intention to ratify in time  for the WSSD, adding that it was currently the only Umbrella Group  Party to have made such a commitment, although he predicted that  it 'will be in good company before too long.' On the mechanisms, PAKISTAN urged strong, clear and flexible rules  on the CDM based on principles of equity and sustainability, and  stressed that the CDM and other mechanisms should not be a  substitute for long-term emissions reductions. THAILAND said it  would like to see equal treatment of modalities and rules between  mechanisms and a balance between adaptation and mitigation  activities. CHILE said the CDM would facilitate access to  technology and address local environmental problems, and urged the  IPCC to 'speed up' work on procedures for good practice guidance  and permanence. MALAYSIA said the Executive Board should ensure  environmental integrity of all projects. URUGUAY noted its  willingness to participate in CDM sinks activities, and  highlighted national efforts to prepare for the CDM. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION insisted on the removal of limitations on Parties'  ability to use the mechanisms.

On capacity building and technology transfer, JORDAN said that  progress in combating climate change required financial  assistance, transfer of environmentally-sound technologies, and  the extension of technical assistance for capacity building. EGYPT  recommended the establishment of environmental information centers  and clearinghouses for the transfer of environmentally-sound  technologies. MALAYSIA, MOZAMBIQUE, PORTUGAL, URUGUAY and KUWAIT  also highlighted the need for technology transfer.

On the circumstances and needs of LDCs, TANZANIA, BENIN and  DJIBOUTI noted that they will be most affected by climate change  and have the least capacity to cope. He urged steps to ensure that  LDCs can be fully involved in CDM projects. MOZAMBIQUE and  PORTUGAL noted the importance of the draft decisions on LDCs.  Regarding assistance to countries highly dependent on fossil fuel  exports, KUWAIT highlighted the importance of such assistance, and  proposed: removal of tax incentives and exemptions from duties and  fees in all sectors relating to emissions of gases; elimination of  incentives for unsound technology; assistance for diversifying  economies; and the development of technology to allow lower  emissions from fossil fuel use.

On adaptation, PAKISTAN noted the need to broaden the focus from  mitigation toward action on adaptation and vulnerability. PERU  stressed the lack of adaptation and vulnerability research.  ALGERIA emphasized that arid and semi-arid zones are on the  frontline of vulnerability, and encouraged synergies between the  CCD, CBD and UNFCCC. NAMIBIA said an adaptive response requires,  inter alia, an interdisciplinary and multi-sectoral approach.  PORTUGAL said adaptation could promote sustainable development and  equity within and across generations. PANAMA, for Central American  Parties, drew attention to a new GEF regional adaptation pilot  project, and URUGUAY underscored the importance of the Adaptation  Fund. BANGLADESH supported the speedy application of the  Adaptation and LDC Funds, and highlighted the particular  vulnerability of low lying and small island states.

## OTHER STATEMENTS

### Observer States: T

URKEY said it was looking  forward to COP-7's adoption of a decision forwarded from SBI  removing Turkey from the Annex II list and recognizing its special  circumstances as an Annex I Party.

###     Intergovernmental Organizations:

The INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY  said it was working on solutions to 'marshal market forces' to  achieve realistic climate change objectives. He highlighted  renewable energy options in combating climate change, while  advocating that no possible fuel or technology solution be  excluded, noting that carbon-intense options might be offset by  carbon sequestration, or that concerns over nuclear could be  resolved.

OPEC highlighted the impacts of climate change response measures  on economies that are highly dependent on fossil fuel exports. He  suggested that the 'entire philosophy of energy taxation' be  reconsidered, and stated that the biggest environmental challenge  is poverty.

###     NGOs:

CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK SOUTH stated that the commitment of  developed countries to combating climate change and meeting their  obligations 'remains weak.' He supported a strong compliance  regime for the Protocol, and called for clear commitments to the  various funds agreed at COP-6 Part II, labeling current financial  undertakings as 'pathetic.' The INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE  said further attention needed to be paid to developing the details  on the mechanisms, including on the effect of the compliance  regime on credits acquired or sold by businesses with respect to  emissions trading, and on transfer and use of credits acquired  through CDM project investment. Beyond COP-7, he advocated early  negotiations on second and third commitment periods, and  implementation of the UNFCCC in a manner that would allow full  business participation.

The INDIGENOUS PEOPLES' ORGANIZATIONS noted that there are 350  million indigenous peoples in the world, with many being extremely  vulnerable to climate change. She requested a COP decision to  grant indigenous peoples a specific status in the climate change  process, and said it should create an ad hoc intersessional open- ended working group. GLOBAL LEGISLATORS ORGANIZATION FOR A  BALANCED ENVIRONMENT supported a rigorous compliance system,  limits on the use of sinks, and a CDM that involves as many  developing countries and LDCs as possible, and that includes  small-scale projects. He supported active public procurement  policies to bring prices down for renewable energy and called for  technology leap-frogging. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK NORTH linked  climate change to health and poverty issues. She said Parties  should not reopen agreed limits on the use of sinks, and sinks  credits must not be carried into the next commitment period.  Noting that she was from a Russian NGO, she said the Russian  Federation will benefit from participation in the Protocol, and  highlighted a statement by President Putin stating that he would  be cooperating with the EU with a view to early ratification and  entry into force.

The US and EUROPEAN BUSINESS COUNCILS FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY  supported a fast-track for CDM projects, early crediting, full  transferability of CERs, and a binding compliance regime. He also  called for climate change processes to allow for civil society  input while critical issues are being debated. The INTERNATIONAL  CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS, TRADE UNION ADVISORY COMMITTEE  TO THE OECD and EUROPEAN CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE UNIONS  highlighted the potential for job creation resulting from climate  change measures and called for employment transition programmes.

The WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT highlighted  the role of business as a solution provider and said the  mechanisms should be efficient and function with low transaction  costs. The WORLD COUNCIL OF CHURCHES evoked its convening of a  COP-7 interfaith colloquium and outlined the Muslim and Christian  perspectives on protecting the environment and avoiding climate  change.

# SBI

SBI-15 convened for its final meeting to address its three  outstanding agenda items: LDCs, CGE and the report of the session.  On LDCs, Parties adopted draft conclusions on assessing the status  of implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.9 (LDCs). They also agreed  to forward to the COP unbracketed draft decisions on: the  establishment of an LDC Fund; guidance to the financial mechanism  for the operation of the LDC Fund; and guidelines for the  preparation of NAPAs. Parties also adopted a draft decision on the  CGE, and the report of the session.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The negotiating group on Articles 5,  7 and 8 met in an afternoon session. Chair Dovland reported that  ministers and other senior officials were consulting on a LULUCF  compromise proposal, and would also consider the issue of  reporting on supplementarity and narrowing of per capita emissions  differences, as well as questions related to reporting and review  of Article 3.14 (adverse effects) implementation.

Turning to other outstanding issues, delegates agreed on text on  confidentiality proposed by a drafting group that had met in the  morning. On the draft COP-7 decision, Parties accepted language  requesting the Secretariat to prepare a document analyzing how  confidentiality is dealt with in other international treaty bodies  and organizations. On Article 4 (joint fulfillment), Chair Dovland  noted that the EU and Umbrella Group were holding bilateral  consultations, and that the issue would not be forwarded to  ministers. JAPAN and the G-77/CHINA agreed to hold bilateral  consultations on the matter of reinstatement of mechanisms'  eligibility.

The G-77/CHINA then introduced a proposal on the composition of  ERTs and the selection of Lead Reviewers, based on a formula  considering both UN regional representation, and Annex I and non- Annex I membership. Several delegates expressed confusion over the  proposal and concern that it could open up previously agreed  paragraphs. After the meeting closed, informal consultations  continued.

### MECHANISMS

High-level regional and bilateral consultations  continued throughout the day facilitated by Valli Moosa (South  Africa) and Phillipe Roch (Switzerland), with new draft decisions  for a work programme on mechanisms distributed in the evening.  Crunch issues across the mechanisms that remained to be resolved  included eligibility requirements, bankability and transferability  of units, and the issuance and cancellation of RMUs.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As high-level negotiations continued late Thursday night, final  agreement remained elusive on the package deal proposed earlier in  the evening by facilitators Moosa and Roch. According to reports,  by 10:30 pm, all regional groups except the Umbrella Group had  accepted the deal. At 11:30 pm, ministers reconvened to hear  whether the Umbrella Group would join the consensus. However, no  deal had been made by shortly before 1:00 am, and ministers  decided to resume at 9:00 am after consultations with capitals,  amid concerns as to whether a deal could be struck Friday.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### HIGH-LEVEL NEGOTIATIONS

High-level negotiations are likely to  resume around 9:00 am to continue seeking an agreement on the  package deal.

### CLOSING PLENARY

The COP Plenary to adopt outstanding decisions  and conclusions will take place after negotiations have been  completed. Check the monitors for updates.
