    On Monday, Parties met to discuss: the programme budget for the  biennium 2004-2005; Articles 5, 7 and 8; policies and measures  (P&Ms); sinks in the CDM; implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and  4.9 (adverse effects); the IPCC TAR; the SCCF; and arrangements  for intergovernmental meetings. A number of informal drafting  groups convened over the two days, and the CDM Executive Board  held its ninth meeting from 7-8 June 2003.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### CAPACITY BUILDING

On Saturday, Chair Dechen Tsering circulated  draft conclusions. Since most regional groups had been unable to  consult before the text, the meeting was adjourned. Chair Tsering  said she would conduct informal consultations.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET

On Monday, Chair John Ashe presented a revised  draft decision and detailed breakdown of costs associated with  Protocol activities. Parties agreed on text that requests the  Executive Secretary to provide administrative and financial  implications, rather than actual costs, of proposed SBSTA and SBI  decisions. The US said administrative funding should include staff  costs and actual positions for the biennium, and requested  clarification on the methodology used to allocate costs for  operational and preparatory activities associated with the  Protocol.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

On Saturday, this group deliberated  on draft COP and COP/MOP decisions regarding training programmes  for ERTs, and text suggested by the drafting group on the code of  conduct for the treatment of confidential data under Article 5.2  (adjustments). On the draft COP decision, Parties discussed the  initial training programme's premises and courses. CANADA  expressed interest in contributing resources to the basic course  on review of inventories. The EU preferred prioritizing the LULUCF  training module, if resources are limited. With regard to the  proposed text on adjustments, Parties discussed the difficulty of  transmitting confidential information to reviewers based in their  home countries, and debated whether local diplomatic  representation could be used for this purpose.

This contact group met twice on Monday. In the morning, Parties  considered criteria for selecting lead reviewers. CANADA  questioned the need for lead reviewers to be examined on training  elements other than the modalities for accounting assigned amounts  and review of national registries. Delegates discussed whether  topics for examination should be included in an annex to the draft  COP/MOP decision or as an annex to the SBSTA-17 report. Parties  also addressed the appropriate placement of a reference discussing  lead reviewers' disclosure of potential conflicts of interest  relating to review activities. On desirable criteria, Parties  debated language requirements for review team members.

In the evening, delegates discussed the draft technical guidance  on methodologies for adjustments, and its associated decision text.  They amended the technical guidance to ensure that adjustments  will be conservative, and that adjustments will not take place if  a Party has underestimated base year emissions or overestimated  emissions in a commitment period year. Following further  discussions, delegates agreed the draft technical guidance.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Co-Chair Greg Terrill introduced draft  conclusions on Monday. The G-77/CHINA said the text should refer  only to Annex I Parties and should not directly or indirectly  encourage non-Annex I Parties to share information. SAMOA said all  Parties could benefit from information sharing, even if actions to  share information are only taken by Annex I Parties. The US said  information sharing between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties would  facilitate capacity building and technology transfer activities.  The G-77/CHINA, opposed by AUSTRALIA, the EU, JAPAN, SAMOA, and US,  requested that text referring to information sharing at side  events be deleted. Regarding web-based approaches to information  sharing, the US expressed concern that the need to update a  website might create a new type of reporting requirement.

### SINKS IN THE CDM

On Saturday, Co-Chair Thelma Krug requested  Parties' views on proposed guidelines for socioeconomic and  environmental impact assessments, which are contained in an annex  to the consolidated negotiating text. The G-77/CHINA suggested  that issues in the annex be addressed in the body of the text.  Noting its proposal in the annex on impact assessments, AOSIS said  host countries of A&R CDM projects and the country acquiring CERs  should ensure environmental integrity of the Protocol. The CLIMATE  ACTION NETWORK expressed concern over the possible deletion of the  annex. The EU, G-77/CHINA and SWITZERLAND emphasized the need to  design guidelines according to specific country needs. NORWAY  called for a COP-9 decision on socioeconomic, environmental and  biodiversity impacts of A&R CDM projects. The AFRICA GROUP  requested voluntary assistance and active stakeholder  participation in A&R CDM project implementation.

On Monday, delegates exchanged views on project evaluation, and  discussed textual changes to the consolidated negotiating text.  Noting that there is no agreed way to evaluate social impacts,  BOLIVIA requested deleting text on social impacts. MALAYSIA  expressed concern about text on local stakeholder involvement in  project design. Delegates also addressed additionality,  regulations for small scale projects and baseline methodologies.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

On Monday, Co-Chair Robert Mason  invited general comments on the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions,  noting that consultations on the terms of reference (TOR) for the  synergies workshop are ongoing. SAUDI ARABIA said consideration of  the TOR for the synergies workshop should be postponed until a  date is specified for the economic diversification workshop. AOSIS  proposed that the group begin by considering the results of the  workshop on insurance and risk assessment. The G-77/CHINA, with  others, said they had not consulted within the Group on the draft  conclusions and preferred postponing the discussions. Co-Chair  Mason adjourned the meeting to allow for consultations.

### IPCC TAR

This group met on Saturday to consider the Co-Chairs'  draft conclusions. The G-77/CHINA and US opposed establishing a  process for considering the TAR in COP and Subsidiary Body agenda  items. CANADA objected to SBSTA considering documents other than  the TAR when informing COP and Subsidiary Body agenda items. The  G-77/CHINA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and US objected to text requesting  the Secretariat to develop a draft work programme on the TAR. The  US, supported by CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, and opposed by SAUDI  ARABIA, proposed that the Secretariat produce an information paper  on links between the TAR and other agenda items. The EU expressed  hope that Parties would agree to request more than just an  information paper.

The G-77/CHINA preferred addressing mitigation and adaptation  separately. They also opposed considering integrated approaches to  adaptation and mitigation and objected to the proposed request for  the IPCC to hold a side event at COP-9 on the issue. CANADA, the  US, EU, NEW ZEALAND, and AUSTRALIA said that cross-cutting  elements of mitigation and adaptation should be addressed and that  a side event would be helpful in advancing knowledge on these  elements. On Monday, Parties continued discussing these issues.

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND

On Saturday, Co-Chair Jaap Rooimans  (the Netherlands) said the contact group would define and  prioritize the activities, programmes and measures to be financed  under the SCCF, and provide operational guidance to the GEF. The  G-77/CHINA and others said the SCCF should finance activities  currently not supported by existing funds, and, with MICRONESIA,  TANZANIA and KENYA, stressed the importance of prioritizing  adaptation activities. SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by MICRONESIA, said  the SCCF should prioritize adaptation with regard to economic  diversification activities. COLOMBIA said adaptation activities  should be based on priorities identified in national  communications. CHINA noted that the SCCF should prioritize  adaptation, technology transfer, capacity building and target  programmes identified in national strategies for sustainable  development. The EU stressed that the SCCF should have a catalytic  function. CANADA said the SCCF should address both adaptation and  mitigation measures, and proposed poverty reduction, sustainable  development and good governance as guiding principles. NORWAY  stressed that the SCCF should be complementary to the GEF and  other multilateral and bilateral agencies.

On Monday, the GEF emphasized the importance of clear and specific  guidance, and of avoiding duplication with other GEF activities.  BURKINA FASO said the LDC Fund and the SCCF should be  complementary. ARGENTINA, supported by AOSIS, the LDCs, KENYA,  COLOMBIA, and NAMIBIA, stressed the urgency of the Co-Chairs  preparing a draft conclusion. In addition, AOSIS proposed that  Parties submit further views prior to COP-9. The EU identified  several guiding principles, including mainstreaming of climate  change into development processes, providing a catalytic function,  and building on existing GEF arrangements. In response to the EU,  AOSIS and the LDCs noted that the principles should not create  obstacles in accessing financing. JAPAN called for clear SCCF  guidelines and for consideration of LDC Fund experiences.  Supported by GHANA, he urged that the SCCF find a balance between  mitigation and adaptation activities. The Co-Chairs said they  would prepare draft conclusions for the next meeting.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This contact group  met Monday to consider draft conclusions proposed by the Chair on  arrangements for COP-9, future sessional periods, effective  participation in the UNFCCC process, and arrangements for COP/MOP- 1, which included two proposals for draft decisions. On the  effective participation in the UNFCCC process, ARGENTINA stressed  the need to facilitate effective participation of developing  country Parties. He expressed concern over arrangements for COP-9  that presently require participants to make advance payments for  accommodation. ITALY said that efforts to facilitate the  participation of all delegates to COP-9 were being made. Regarding  the proposed round-table session at COP-9, delegates underscored  the need for consensus on topics to be addressed, and proposed  language to reflect this in the draft conclusions. Delegates also  discussed how to refer to the different capacities of the SBSTA  and SBI acting under the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and the  possibility for joint meetings of the COP and COP/MOP.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates returned from their break on Sunday to find that what  little momentum existed at the end of last week had dissipated.  Some observers expressed frustration at the lack of progress in  the contact groups on adverse effects and the IPCC TAR, and noted  that one exasperated delegate had stormed out of discussions on  the SCCF. Others, however, were optimistic. They noted that the  CDM Executive Board had a productive weekend addressing baseline  methodologies and reviewing a series of project proposals.
