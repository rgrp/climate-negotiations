abstract: "Delegates to the Eighteenth Sessions of the UNFCCC Subsidiary  Bodies (SB-18) continued their deliberations Friday, convening  meetings of the SBI and SBSTA and a number of contact and informal  groups. In the morning, the SBSTA addressed cooperation with  relevant international organizations, and other matters, including  issues relating to cleaner or less-greenhouse gas-emitting energy,  and issues relating to the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3  (adverse effects of policies and measures). In the afternoon, the  SBI met to discuss several items, including: non-Annex I financial  matters; capacity building; national communications; and a request  by a group of countries of Central Asia and the Caucasus, Albania  and the Republic of Moldova (CACAM) regarding their status under  the UNFCCC. Contact groups were also held on: the programme budget  for the biennium 2004-2005; implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8  and 4.9 (adverse effects); Protocol Articles 5 (methodological  issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of  information); the IPCC TAR; research and systematic observation  (R&SO); policies and measures (P&Ms); and capacity building."

# SBSTA

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The CCD  Secretariat recommended that synergies between conventions take  place at field level. The RAMSAR Secretariat noted that  governments may face challenges in simultaneously meeting their  commitments under the UNFCCC and Ramsar Convention. The IPCC  provided an update on its activities. The FAO reviewed its  capacity-building work on forests and climate change, and the IUCN  noted its technical and legal support to several developing  countries on definitions and modalities for sinks in the CDM. The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION announced its ratification of the CCD.  SWITZERLAND, with the EU, proposed that the UNFCCC Secretariat  regularly report on relevant WTO activities. CANADA, COLOMBIA and  the US supported Chair Thorgeirsson's suggestion that such  reporting activities be undertaken at national level instead.  COLOMBIA, opposed by KUWAIT and SAUDI ARABIA, suggested using the  Secretariat's Note on the WTO for future discussion on this issue.

### OTHER MATTERS

Issues relating to cleaner or less-greenhouse gas- emitting energy: CANADA, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, and  opposed by the EU and G-77/CHINA, requested that SBSTA conclusions  take note of Canada's proposal for a study on the role of trade in  cleaner energy in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC and the  Protocol. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would hold informal  consultations and prepare draft conclusions on this issue.

###     Issues relating to the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3

The  G-77/CHINA requested, inter alia, that this issue be made a  regular agenda item, and that SBSTA consider a draft decision on  initial actions. CANADA and the EU argued that this issue is  adequately addressed by previous decisions. Chair Thorgeirsson  said he would hold informal consultations and prepare draft  conclusions on this issue.

###     Any other matters

The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, with AUSTRALIA, CANADA,  JAPAN and the US, suggested SBSTA express support for the World  Conference on Climate Change, to be held in Moscow from 29  September to 3 October 2003.

# SBI

Chair Stoycheva announced that Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Jaap  Rooimans (the Netherlands) would co-chair the contact group on the  Special Climate Change Fund, and that Mamadou Honadia (Burkina  Faso) and Jos√© Romero (Switzerland) would co-chair the informal  consultation on the LDC Fund. ESTONIA, for the CENTRAL GROUP  ELEVEN, announced that the group had decided to terminate its  activities. CROATIA, for BULGARIA and ROMANIA, said that they  would cooperate in a new group called the Central Group.

### NON-ANNEX I FINANCIAL MATTERS

The GEF reported on the outcomes of  its Council meeting in May 2003, and highlighted several decisions  regarding support for national communications. The G-77/CHINA  urged Parties to complete their national communications as soon as  possible. With BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, PAKISTAN and AOSIS, he called  for the timely disbursement of financial resources, and for  holding regional and subregional workshops on the guidelines for  the second national communications. Chair Stoycheva said she would  prepare draft conclusions on this issue.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

The Secretariat noted the comprehensive review  of the framework for capacity building at COP-9. The G-77/CHINA  stressed that the review process should contain an analysis of  current project and programme implementation in response to  decision 2/CP.7 (capacity building in developing countries),  identify gaps and possible areas for further improvement in  implementation, and outline steps to be undertaken by SBI in  monitoring capacity-building activities. CANADA said that the  review should also include activities undertaken prior to the COP- 7 decision. JAPAN cautioned against adopting standardized elements  and guidelines for the review. Chair Stoycheva announced that a  contact group chaired by Dechen Tsering (Bhutan) would consider  this issue.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Jean-Pascal van Ypersele (Belgium) reported on  the UNECE regional workshop. During the workshop, participants  made recommendations on aspects of the national and international- level implementation of Article 6, including formal and non-formal  education and the need for public awareness. Several Parties, UNEP,  UNESCO and ISDR, supported the development of an information- network clearing house. BOTSWANA and THAILAND offered to host  regional workshops.

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The US reaffirmed its commitment  to reduce its emissions intensity and opposed the creation of new  bodies to review the communications. AUSTRALIA said that while it  did not intend to ratify the Protocol, it was still committed to  achieving its emission target under the Protocol. The G-77/CHINA  and AOSIS expressed concern that emissions could continue to rise,  despite mitigation measures, and urged Annex I Parties to  implement more rigorous policies and measures. Chair Stoycheva  said that she would prepare draft conclusions on this issue.

### CACAM REQUEST

On the status of the CACAM group of countries under  the UNFCCC, Chair Stoycheva said she would continue to consult  informally and prepare draft conclusions.

### OTHER MATTERS

The use of guidelines for the preparation of non- Annex I national communications: CUBA, with BURKINA FASO, the G-77/CHINA and TUVALU, said the implementation of the guidelines  will require additional financial resources and capacity building,  and, with the EU, emphasized the need to focus on vulnerability  and adaptation, and greenhouse gas inventories. Chair Stoycheva  said she would prepare draft conclusions on this issue.

###     Proposal by Croatia on LULUCF and Special Circumstances of Croatia  under UNFCCC Article 4.6

Chair Stoycheva said these items were  considered jointly. The Secretariat introduced documents  containing Croatia's submission on its proposed forest management  value and emissions inventory adjustments. The EU encouraged  Croatia to submit a consistent time series of emissions data using  consistent methodologies for 1990-2001. BOSNIA and HERZEGOVINA,  and SERBIA and MONTENEGRO indicated it could not support Croatia's  greenhouse gas emissions inventory adjustments for the 1990 base  year. Jim Penman (UK) will facilitate informal consultations on  the Croatian proposals.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### PROGRAMME BUDGET

Contact group Chair John Ashe (Antigua and  Barbuda) presented a draft COP-9 decision containing three options  on the draft budget and indicative scales that separate financing  for UNFCCC and Protocol activities to differing degrees. The US  stressed the importance of accounting methods, especially under  the UNFCCC Trust Fund for Supplementary Activities, and, with  JAPAN and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, requested indication of those  activities directly related to the Protocol. CANADA, the US and  the EU said budget decisions taken while the UNFCCC is in a  'transition period' could set a precedent for future decisions,  and, with AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, requested a breakdown of costs  associated with the three options in the Chair's paper.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

This contact group,  co-chaired by Robert Mason (UK) and Fadhel Lari (Kuwait), met to  consider progress on the implementation of activities under  decision 5/CP.7 (implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9).  The EU, US and CANADA highlighted progress made, including the  GEF's third replenishment, the establishment of the LDC Fund, and  development of guidelines for NAPAs. The G-77/CHINA, supported by  SAUDI ARABIA, AOSIS, KUWAIT and LIBYA, said that progress to date  was insufficient and urged Parties to begin by examining the  recommendations of the recent risk assessment and insurance  workshops. The US, EU and AUSTRALIA objected to this suggestion.  Following requests by NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, the US and EU,  informal consultations were held on the agenda of the workshop on  synergies scheduled for 2-4 July 2003, in Espoo, Finland.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

Delegates discussed means to improve  the professionalism and performance of the expert review teams  (ERTs), and training. On improving ERT performance, Parties  addressed proposed elements for inclusion in the Agreement for  Expert Review Services. The EU, supported by ARGENTINA and BOLIVIA,  said information provided by Parties for the inventory review  could be used by the experts in preparing their countries'  inventories, but should not be disclosed to a third party.  Addressing disclosure of information during the review process,  Parties questioned whether the Party being reviewed would be privy  to information on the review. Delegates also discussed whether  information and observations can be shared with lead reviewers not  on the review team. The US asked how conflicts of interest of ERT  members might be addressed.

On training, delegates discussed courses for experts, including  the status of those who fail examinations, and whether  examinations should be mandatory and courses should have final  seminars. Co-Chair Newton Paciornik said the Co-Chairs would draft  conclusions on this issue.

### IPCC TAR

Co-Chair David Warrilow provided an overview of draft  conclusions and elements of a draft decision. Following discussion,  delegates agreed that they needed more time to consider the text.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

After making minor amendments  to the Co-Chairs' text, the contact group finalized consideration  of draft conclusions and a draft decision on this issue.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

The EU, supported by the US, suggested  holding workshops to share information on sector or sub-sector  specific activities. The G-77/CHINA said information sharing  should focus on the adverse effects of P&Ms on developing  countries. The US, supported by SAMOA, suggested that the  Secretariat develop terms of reference (TORs) for future workshops  in accordance with decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms), which refers to  adverse effects. The G-77/CHINA opposed additional workshops,  regardless of their TORs, citing budgetary constraints and the  need for 'a total discussion' on the implementation of decision  13/CP.7. JAPAN, supported by the EU, suggested further enhancing  web-based information exchange. Co-Chair Richard Muyungi (Tanzania)  said he would prepare draft conclusions for discussion.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

In this contact group, chaired by Dechen  Tsering, delegates exchanged views on their expectations and on  the process of the comprehensive review of capacity-building  activities in developing countries. Chair Tsering said she would  prepare a draft decision for consideration in the group.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Expressing concern that their indicative contribution to the  UNFCCC budget could rise 'dramatically,' some delegates wondered  how to enforce budget discipline. Others welcomed a larger budget  as an indication that the Secretariat is enhancing its ability to  meet the ever-increasing needs of Parties. Some observers noted  that while there was a legal and procedural justification to  separate the work programmes of the UNFCCC and the Protocol, the  financial consequences of the separation could constrain the work  of the COP/MOP.
