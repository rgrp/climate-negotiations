# WELCOMING CEREMONY

COP-5 President Jan Szyszko (Poland) opened the meeting,  encouraging delegates to look for common ground and explore  compromises in order to streamline negotiating texts and  achieve success at COP-6.

FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar drew  participants' attention to two political challenges: the  need to support developing countries in their response to  climate change impacts; and the importance of realizing the  goals of the Protocol. He cautioned against attempts to  renegotiate parts of the Protocol, as this would result in  its collapse. He also expressed regret at the passing away  of two prominent figures in climate change negotiations:  Jean Ripert of France, who chaired the Intergovernmental  Negotiating Committee that resulted in the adoption of the  FCCC in 1992; and Zhong Shukong, Special Advisor on  Environmental Issues in China's Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.

Raymond Barre, Mayor of the City of Lyon, expressed his  hope for a successful outcome for SB-13. He noted the  presence of France's Prime Minister and Minister of Spatial  Planning and Environment as a sign of the political and  economic importance attached to the work on climate change.

Lionel Jospin, Prime Minister of France, noted France's  active support for early ratification of the Protocol. He  stressed the importance of domestic action as the most  important instrument to reduce emissions, and said the  mechanisms should be applicable to no more than half of the  efforts from each state. He also expressed caution over the  inclusion of sinks. He urged developing countries not to  postpone action, and recommended expeditious adoption of  the CDM. He stated that his Government's recent measures to  mitigate the impact of rising oil prices did not compromise  France's climate change programme.

# SBI

Following the welcoming ceremony, SBI met briefly to adopt  its agenda and schedule of work. SBI Chair John Ashe  (Antigua & Barbuda) noted that 184 parties had ratified the  FCCC and 23 had ratified or acceded to the Protocol.

# SBSTA

SBSTA convened in both morning and evening sessions,  beginning by adopting its agenda and organization of work.

### LULUCF

Informal group Co-Chair Gwage (Uganda) indicated  progress and expressed his desire for a short negotiating  text. JAPAN opposed separating human-induced and natural  effects, while SWITZERLAND underscored that the integrity  of the Protocol depends on their separation. BRAZIL, for  the G-77/CHINA, outlined its principles for LULUCF,  including that agreed-upon Annex I LULUCF activities should  not change the global effect of the Protocol. The EU said  additional activities under Protocol Article 3.4 should not  be applied during the first commitment period unless  concerns related to scale, uncertainties and risks  associated with sinks are resolved. CANADA expressed  confidence that these concerns can be met and, with JAPAN,  stressed inclusion of Article 3.4 activities in the first  commitment period as a condition for ratification of the  Protocol. Discussions will continue in a contact group.

### IMPACT OF SINGLE PROJECTS ON EMISSIONS IN THE COMMITMENT  PERIOD

Chair Dovland noted that no submissions had been  made by Parties on the matter by 17 July 2000, as requested  by SBSTA-11. Following statements by ICELAND and other  Annex I countries, he concluded that full agreement had yet  to be reached, and requested Ole Plougmann (Denmark) to  conduct informal consultations on the issue.

### OTHER METHODOLOGICAL MATTERS

Emissions from bunker fuels:  The Secretariat reported on cooperation with ICAO and the  IMO, and on efforts within these organizations to identify  options to limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Chair  Dovland noted their progress reports, as requested by  SBSTA-11. The IMO introduced its study on greenhouse gas  emissions from ships, which will be available at SBSTA-14.

Methods and tools for vulnerability and adaptation  assessments: The Secretariat noted that a workshop with  IPCC experts will be held following the release of the IPCC  report in April 2001.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The US emphasized the importance of  technology needs assessments and an integrated approach. He  urged the COP-6 decision to build on the recent technology  cooperation pilot project and to consider future roles for  the Climate Technology Initiative. INDONESIA highlighted  the importance of: monitoring and evaluating technology  transfer, minimizing dumping of inefficient technologies,  and developing a clearinghouse for technology transfer. The  EU urged that identification of needs and priorities should  be country-driven and region-specific, and should identify  priorities for both mitigation and adaptation. With  MALAYSIA, he underlined the importance of an enabling  environment in developed and developing countries, and of  using existing mechanisms. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA advocated  greater focus on supply-side issues. Discussions will  continue in a contact group.

BEST PRACTICES IN POLICES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): The EU  emphasized experience sharing and information exchange,  identifying opportunities for cooperation and contributing  to the assessment of demonstrable progress. CANADA, with  the US and JAPAN, emphasized that the Copenhagen workshop  on P&Ms fulfilled relevant BAPA requirements. He urged  avoiding linkages with other issues, including demonstrable  progress. URUGUAY highlighted the possible impact of P&Ms  on developing countries. A contact group was established.

### OTHER MATTERS

SBSTA also addressed Protocol Articles 5  (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information)  and 8 (review of information). Group Co-Chair Helen Plume  (New Zealand) noted that substantial work remained. A  contact group was established to continue discussions. On  cooperation with relevant international organizations, the  Secretariat noted recent cooperative work with the  Convention on Biodiversity.

# JOINT SBI/SBSTA

### GENERAL STATEMENTS

The joint SBI/SBSTA began with general  statements by several Parties. The EUROPEAN COMMISSION said  the EU hoped COP-6 would ensure the ratification of the  Protocol for entry into force in 2002. She encouraged  strong consequences in cases of non-compliance. FRANCE,  speaking for the EU, suggested that the momentum from Kyoto  had been lost. She urged each country to assume its  responsibility and adopt emissions reduction measures.

NIGERIA, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern  that developed countries were not engaging in meaningful  FCCC implementation. He stressed the importance of taking  comprehensive decisions on all issues. The AFRICA GROUP  noted concerns with availability of translated documents,  the convening of too many meetings and rigid positions  taken by developed countries. VENEZUELA said developed  countries should not avoid commitments or attempt to  transfer commitments to developing countries. INDONESIA  stressed the importance of capacity building, adaptation,  Annex I domestic action, and technology transfer.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

On FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol  Article 3.14 (adverse effects), Chair Dovland noted that  negotiating text had been prepared based on informal  consultations held in August and last week. Group Co-Chair  Abdulmohsen Al Sunaid (Saudi Arabia) noted progress, but  drew attention to disagreements over whether to have two  decisions that address FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and  Protocol Article 3.14 separately, or one decision dealing  with both.

The G-77/CHINA called for the will to implement 'long  overdue' actions on FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 at COP-6 and,  supported by SAUDI ARABIA, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, and  JAMAICA, called for two separate decisions. The EU said it  was aware of the importance of these issues for developing  countries, particularly least developed countries and, with  the US, supported one decision. The US added that progress  had been made and he remained optimistic. Discussions will  continue in a contact group.

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY

On activities implemented  jointly under the pilot phase, the Secretariat presented a  report indicating, inter alia, better regional and  technical distribution of projects, improved quality of  reporting and strengthened capacity in host countries. It  was also noted that a revised uniform reporting format was  available.

CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA, EGYPT and TUNISIA, highlighted  the need to extend the pilot phase and ensure greater  geographical balance in projects. With the US and CANADA,  he suggested that the revised uniform reporting format be  discussed at SBSTA-14. HUNGARY suggested that the AIJ  experience should be used to implement JI, and the EU said  it could be used to elaborate the CDM Reference Manual. She  added that crediting for projects should only be possible  after the Protocol comes into effect. Parties agreed to  discuss the AIJ pilot phase and the revised uniform  reporting format at SBSTA-14.

### MECHANISMS

On mechanisms, the Secretariat presented the  documents and Chair Chow outlined the state of  deliberations on the text. Highlighting the slow pace of  discussions, AUSTRALIA said it would only ratify the  Protocol if there was a workable package at COP-6. The G-77/CHINA highlighted the need to address equity, nature and  scope, supplementarity and cross-cutting issues. Opposed by  CANADA, he said the decisions on the three mechanisms  should have three different chapeaus. Discussions will  continue in the contact group.

Delegates also briefly addressed matters relating to  compliance and to capacity building, referring these issues  to contact groups.

# INFORMAL MEETINGS AND CONTACT GROUPS

### CAPACITY BUILDING

The contact group considered the  framework for capacity building in EITs and in developing  countries, and began consideration of a proposed draft  decision on capacity building in EITs.

Regarding EITs, issues discussed included: the need for  capacity building to assist in achieving the overall  objectives of the Convention and Protocol; whether  consideration of progress on capacity building relating to  the Protocol should be referred to the COP/MOP; and who  should monitor progress. CANADA stressed elaborating the  concept of an enabling environment to ensure that it does  not imply delays in initiating capacity building  activities. SLOVENIA introduced a proposal for a draft  decision calling for a prompt start to capacity building in  EITs, and a COP decision to initiate the creation of the  framework for capacity building.

Regarding a framework for non-Annex I country capacity  building, participants sought clarity on, inter alia, how  to monitor implementation, whether there should be  coherence in the frameworks for EITs and developing  countries, the role of national focal points, and how GEF  could be involved in the implementation of the framework.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

In informal  consultations, the US, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION,  addressed the issue of late payment of dues, seeking  information on existing practices in other UN fora.  Speaking for several developing countries, IRAN asked for a  postponement of the discussion until COP-6, and ARGENTINA  added that the options included were unacceptable. The US  stated that 89% of dues had been collected this year, while  the Secretariat noted that, although this was correct, one- third of Parties had not yet paid. Chair Mahmoud Ould El  Ghaouth (Mauritania) said he would transmit to SBI the  recommendation that the issue be discussed at COP-6.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates have been discussing rumors about a possible deal  under negotiation between certain developed country groups.  While the details remain hazy, some speculation centered  around an agreement on parts of the text relating to the  mechanisms, while others suggested the agreement may  incorporate a wider package deal. Observers suggest such a  move, which would marginalize developing countries, could  provoke a backlash in the negotiations.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### SBI

SBI will convene at 10:00 am in Plenary I to consider  the venue of COP-7, administrative and financial matters,  national communications, and the financial mechanism.

### CONTACT GROUPS

A number of contact groups will meet to  begin negotiations on the newly-revised draft negotiating  texts. Negotiations will address: policies and measures,  Articles 5, 7 and 8, compliance, the mechanisms, technology  transfer, adverse effects and LULUCF. Check the noticeboard  for details.
