# SBI

## ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS:

Chair Asadi reported on informal discussions regarding a COP decision taken the previous day to refer an agenda item on technology transfer to the SBI, noting that he did not have clear instructions on how the item was to be considered by the SBI. Discussions revolved around procedure and whether to include the matter as a separate SBI agenda item. The UMBRELLA GROUP, opposed by the G-77/CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA, proposed informal consultations. After lengthy discussions, Chair Asadi read the transcript of the previous day's COP discussions confirming the COP's decision. The Secretariat's legal adviser clarified that technology transfer should be a separate agenda item under the SBI. The SBI then adopted its agenda (FCCC/SBI/2007/16), including the item on technology transfer.

## EDUCATION, TRAINING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS:

On Convention Article 6, the Secretariat introduced relevant documents (FCCC/SBI/2007/17, 22 and 26), and UNEP outlined its activities.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Developing country delegates left the SBI plenary with a mix of jubilation and exhaustion after an unscheduled late night session on Tuesday. Their delight followed success in finally providing an SBI platform for the implementation issues around technology transfer. A procedural dispute over SBI's approach to a COP decision to refer the issue to both the SBSTA and SBI took all Tuesday morning to resolve. After a year of informal debate within the G-77/China on how to achieve a breakthrough on technology transfer, some G-77 negotiators commented that one more morning was deemed to be well worth the effort to get a result. Others, however, questioned whether the new item might have negative impacts on expected progress on the issue under the SBSTA . Meanwhile, some participants were also talking about the fact that the SBI had yet to complete the initial consideration of all its agenda items, a delay which would likely impact the schedule for other groups supposed to meet on Wednesday. There's not a lot of room to maneuver if things fall too far behind, warned one delegate.
