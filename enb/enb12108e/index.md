# SBSTA

Delegates adopted the draft conclusions on the review process  relating to greenhouse gas inventories (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.4). In  the draft conclusions, SBSTA endorsed elements of the FCCC  technical review process including the annual initial checks,  annual synthesis and assessment and individual reviews. Chair  Chow said the conclusions will be forwarded for consideration by  SBI, with a view to adopting a decision at COP-5. On other  matters relating to methodological issues (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.6),  an amendment by FIJI to include reference to regional  consultations was accepted.  The US called for consistency in  language used to state that the Secretariat would undertake work  requested in light of the budget. Chair Chow proposed deleting  the paragraph and said this would be addressed in the chapeau of  the overall report on conclusions. Delegates adopted the  conclusions as amended.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### Joint Contact Group on Mechanisms:

Delegates continued  consideration of the synthesis of proposals on the clean  development mechanism (CDM). On further work on CDM, the G-77/CHINA stressed addressing principles and basic elements that  are currently not featured in the synthesis report. The US  identified convergence on, inter alia, the need for work on  baselines and share of proceeds, and the EU highlighted  monitoring, verification, certification and validation.

The G-77/CHINA underscored the significance of capacity  building. Supported by PERU, he said capacity building should be  incorporated into all CDM projects to enhance endogenous  expertise to identify technology needs and capacities for  assimilation of technology. He urged attention to the special  needs of LDCs. The PHILIPPINES stressed that capacity-building  initiatives should be country-driven and within the  intergovernmental process. CHINA said capacity building should  be 'of, for and in' the developing country. The AFRICA GROUP  underscored the importance of an integrated approach to capacity  building and called for guidance from the subsidiary bodies to  UN agencies working on such activities. The EU suggested  coordinating the various capacity-building initiatives so as to  optimize resource use.

PERU highlighted the usefulness of regional discussions on CDM.  SENEGAL suggested involving the financial sector, sensitizing  the public and decision-makers and training developing country  officials. SWITZERLAND noted the bottom-up approach suggested by  the G-77/China and advocated tailor-made approaches for each  country. VENEZUELA stressed the need to establish clear rules  for transparency regarding the project's contribution to  sustainability and the costs, risks and liabilities in the  developing country.

Chair Chow invited delegates to identify areas of convergence  and divergence in views submitted on Protocol Article 6 (joint  implementation) activities to assist in redrafting the synthesis  of proposals. On the structure, purpose and principles, the G-77/CHINA noted its submission on elements that should be  addressed to enable the COP/MOP to elaborate guidelines. CHINA  suggested focusing on cluster issues, including: principles,  purpose, nature and scope; methodological issues; and  institutional issues. The EU suggested including appendices on  technical issues such as baselines and monitoring. SWITZERLAND  inquired about a date for early crediting noting the lack of  clarity in the case of joint implementation (JI). The EU said  there is no provision for it in the Protocol. JAPAN noted areas  of convergence in the proposals submitted on environmental and  cost effectiveness, equity and transparency. The US emphasized  that JI differs from CDM, as it does not share the goal of  promoting sustainable development.

On Parties participating in JI, the EU said they should have  ratified the Protocol and be bound by a compliance regime. On  the involvement of legal entities, she noted the impact they may  have on a Party's responsibilities under Protocol Article 3  (QELROs). JAPAN stated that the term 'operational entities' was  unique to CDM and could not be used when discussing JI. The EU  preferred referring to 'independent entities.' Regarding project eligibility, the EU identified convergence on  a two-step approach in JI; validation before implementation and  certification of emissions reductions, and in elements relating  to assessment of additionality. She noted, however, diverging  views on the methodology for determining baselines.  JAPAN  preferred addressing initiation of JI projects along with  project eligibility and said many countries did not concur with  the two-step approach.  The US underlined the need to ensure  environmental additionality of JI projects.

Concerning project monitoring, the EU said participants should  provide information on their provisions for systematic, accurate  and periodic monitoring and submit the necessary monitoring data  to show that the project has resulted in quantifiable and long- term reductions.

On the definition of emission reduction units (ERUs), the US  noted convergence on how to denominate, serialize and track  ERUs, and reiterated the need to recognize that procedures used  elsewhere may not be appropriate for constructing JI. The US  also said the registry was an important element for ensuring  accurate reporting and tracking, as well as to ensure  compliance.

On the relationship to the AIJ pilot phase, the US, supported by  the EU, said that AIJ activities might be eligible for JI if  they fulfill the rules and requirements set for such projects.  Regarding supplementarity, the EU proposed a concrete ceiling on  the use of all three mechanisms.

Delegates discussed the synthesis of proposals on Protocol  Article 17 (emissions trading) activities. The G-77/CHINA  reiterated the need address principles and basic elements before  dealing with methodological and operational issues. He said  environmental integrity must be inherent in the system, which  should not freeze or perpetuate existing inequities between  Annex B and developing countries. He stressed that the Protocol  had not created any right, title or entitlement and said  emissions trading should be restricted to excess limitations and  reductions additional to a country's commitment. The PHILIPPINES  distinguished emissions trading from other mechanisms and  stressed that it did not imply a right to pollute but an  obligation to reduce greenhouse gases. The EU identified  divergence on interchangeability between CERs and ERUs, and,  with JAPAN, noted convergence on cost effectiveness,  environmental benefits, equity and transparency. With the G-77/CHINA and the US, the EU said the Protocol did not create  property rights, and stated that emissions trading was a way of  fulfilling obligations under the Protocol. AOSIS, with the  African Group, highlighted the need for adaptation surcharges to  be assessed against all the Protocol mechanisms. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION reminded delegates that the Convention aimed at  stabilizing rather than eliminating greenhouse gases in the  atmosphere.

On the definition of units, CANADA noted divergence on the  concept of fungibility among the Protocol mechanisms. Regarding  the sections on competitiveness, market size and structure,  relationship to domestic policies, and liability for sales of  non-surplus units, the G-77/CHINA said such headings are not  neutral and recommended changing them. CANADA said reference to  'competitiveness' should be changed to 'access to emissions  trading.' On market size and structure, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION  suggested either defining or deleting the term 'hot air' in the  text. Regarding levies, the EU noted some divergence regarding  liability for sales of non-surplus units. On capacity building,  the US said paragraphs relating to project specific activities  are not applicable to emissions trading and should be removed.

Chair Chow said he would redraft the documents based on Parties'  comments, and asked for new submissions to be provided by 1 July  1999. The G-77/China urged a later deadline for submissions. The  EU asked for additional time to complete its technical work in  producing draft appendices. Chair Chow said he would extend the  deadline for the technical submission to 1 August, and would  consult with Parties on the suggested 1 July deadline.

###     Non-Annex I communications contact group:

The contact group met to discuss proposed draft decisions submitted by the EU and the  G-77/CHINA and to decide on ways to proceed in preparation for  COP-5. Chair Reifsnyder (US) proposed identifying common  elements between the two proposals. Many delegations highlighted  the differences, including: whether the initial guidelines  should be revised for second national communications; whether  there should be a technical assessment to 'consider'  communications; or if a non-Annex I group of experts should  provide assistance. Other delegations noted common elements  between the proposals on information gaps, GEF enabling  activities, and the need to identify problems faced by non-Annex  I countries in preparing communications. The group opted for a  text 'comparing' the two proposals, rather than attempting to  combine them. Further consultations are expected.

###     Annex I communications:

The Annex I communications contact group  met to discuss the non-inventory part of the draft guidelines.  The group considered a number of paragraphs, and accepted  proposals to, inter alia: title the document 'The National  Report;' delete the paragraph containing definitions of 'shall,'  'encouraged' and 'may;' reorder and rationalize paragraphs  relating to the structure of communications; and consider  developing further the section on mitigation plans as it relates  to reporting of policies and measures by sectors. Deliberations  are scheduled to continue.

### LULUCF

The LULUCF contact group met in the afternoon to  consider draft conclusions negotiated in previous sessions and  an informal meeting held the previous day. The group cleared the  final remaining bracketed text after accepting an EU proposal,  amended by the US and the G-77/China, to note that an invitation  to Parties to provide the Secretariat with guidance on the scope  of a proposed workshop 'may include data, information and a  decision-making framework.' The group concluded its work,  adopting the draft conclusions as amended.

###     Budget:

The contact group met in the afternoon to consider  proposed SBI conclusions and a proposed draft decision to COP-5  on the programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001. The group  also considered a chart comparing the previous, current and  forthcoming budgets proposing an 18.4% increase in the 2000-2001  budget, as compared to the 1998-1999 biennium. Allowing for a  specific amount of expenditure from carry-overs to cover part of  the budget increase would result in a 10.7% rise in indicative  contributions. The group discussed bracketed text in the draft  recommendations and in the draft decision on the 'contingency  budget' related to the consideration of non-Annex I  communications and on authorizing the Executive Secretary,  pending approval by the COP, to draw on carry-overs to cover  part of the budget increase. The group is to hold further  consultations.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

One senior delegate observed that although voluntary commitments  may not be on the agenda at the subsidiary bodies, they remain a  'hot issue' just as in Buenos Aires. They have been compared to  the uninvited guest who refuses to leave the party, notably at  the negotiations on the biennium budget and during the  discussions on non Annex-I communications. Some developing  country participants have linked proposals for assessments of  non-Annex I communications to attempts to prepare the ground  data for new developing country commitments.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR
