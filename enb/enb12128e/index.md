abstract: "The week of informal meetings preceding the twelfth  sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB-12) of the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) began with an  initial briefing by the Chairs of the subsidiary bodies.  Following this, a workshop was convened to consider the  Protocol mechanisms, and informal meetings were held to  address: guidelines on Protocol Articles 5 (methodological  issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of  information); FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article  3.14 (adverse effects); and land use, land-use change and  forestry."

# INITIAL BRIEFING

John Ashe (Antigua & Barbuda), Chair of the Subsidiary Body  for Implementation (SBI), said the goal of the informal  meetings was to make substantial progress and provide  textual proposals for the formal SB-12 sessions, taking  place from 12-16 June. He noted that the week's informal  discussions would address: guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5,7 and 8; the Protocol mechanisms; compliance;  FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14;  policies and measures; land use, land-use change and  forestry; and the development and transfer of technology.

On the issue of technology transfer, Harald Dovland  (Norway), Chair of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and  Technological Advice (SBSTA), noted that the Friends of the  Chair group, established at a previous SBSTA session, could  accept more members, and would at some stage become a  contact group, possibly at SB-13. NIGERIA, on behalf of the  G-77/CHINA, noted the technology concerns of developing  countries and called for the immediate formation of a  contact group.

# INFORMAL MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Mohammed Reza Salamat (Iran)  proposed discussing FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 on Monday, and  Protocol Article 3.14 and procedural issues on Wednesday.  He urged delegates to build on the conclusions of the  technical workshops held in March. The EU suggested that  all three Articles be discussed together so as to reach a  single decision. SAUDI ARABIA, highlighting the fact that  FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14 were  addressed separately under the Buenos Aires Plan of Action  (BAPA), called for two draft decisions. Stating that the  procedural discussion was premature, AUSTRALIA, supported  by several Parties, proposed discussing the substantive  issues before addressing the structure of the decision.

On initial actions, participants suggested, inter alia:  building capacities to cope with climate-related disasters;  integrating climate change issues into national and donor  assistance strategies; and setting priorities at the  national level.

SAUDI ARABIA, with ZIMBABWE, suggested developing a  programme of action building on the workshops held in  March. ZIMBABWE, SAMOA and JAMAICA supported a specific  recommendation on insurance. EGYPT called for the  development of a well-defined vulnerability index. The  NETHERLANDS stated that such a suggestion was premature. He  supported action on adaptation, starting with training for  vulnerability assessment and development of adaptation  options. The EU, with JAMAICA and CANADA, identified non- Annex I national communications as a source of information  on those countries' needs. BRAZIL disagreed, as it was not  mandatory to include vulnerability assessments in national  communications.

On the assessment of the impacts of response measures,  ZIMBABWE said this would depend on the availability of  information on policies and measures. SAUDI ARABIA  highlighted the need, inter alia, to: ensure a  comprehensive approach to policies and measures; enhance  the research, development and use of fossil fuel  sequestration technologies; remove market distortions in  the energy sector; encourage the diversification of energy  sources; and explicitly refer to compensation.

SAMOA stressed the need to interpret Article 3.14 in its  broadest sense and in relation to the FCCC's objective.  AUSTRALIA and the US said discussions should focus on  minimizing adverse impacts rather than on compensation.  SWITZERLAND cautioned against adopting hasty decisions on  the basis of inadequate knowledge. SAUDI ARABIA said  information gaps should not be used as a pretext for  inaction.

### GUIDELINES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Co-Chair Helen  Plume (New Zealand) identified the objectives of the  meeting as finalizing the guidelines under Article 5.1  (national systems), and making progress on the guidelines  under Article 8 (review of information) and methodologies  under Article 5.2 (adjustments). She proposed convening two  subgroups to address these objectives. In response to a  request by the EU, she agreed to hold a session to exchange  views on Article 7 (communication of information).

Takahiko Hiraishi of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) presented the Special Report on Good Practice  Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories. Co-Chair Plume noted that a side event  will be devoted to it during SB-12.

The subgroup on Article 5.1 considered the second Draft  Guidelines for National Systems under Article 5.1 of the  Kyoto Protocol and submissions by the EU and the US.  Delegates discussed technical amendments, including a  suggestion by the EU on a new paragraph on characteristics  of national inventories making reference to monitoring of  legal entities and/or projects under Articles 6 (joint  implementation) and 17 (emissions trading). Co-Chair Newton  Paciornik (Brazil) suggested that this issue be considered  further at the meeting scheduled on cross-cutting issues.

The subgroup on Articles 5.2 and 8 considered the  Objectives and the General Approach of Part I of the  Elements of Draft Guidelines under Article 8 of the Kyoto  Protocol.  Delegates discussed the structure of the  proposed draft guidelines and stressed the need to clarify  whether there would be a separate review procedure  depending on the annual or periodic nature of the  submission of information. They agreed that, inter alia:  Part I cover the annual review of information submitted  under Article 7.1 (annual inventory and supplementary  information) and related information under the FCCC; the  definition of the information covered by Article 7.1 should  be left to the sub-group on Article 7; and a reference to  the trial inventory review period should be introduced.

### LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY

Co-Chair Halldor  Thorgeirsson (Iceland) identified key issues to be  addressed during SB-12, including: consideration of the  IPCC Special Report; preparation of Parties' submissions on  land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF), which  SBSTA-11 requested by 1 August 2000; and draft elements of  decisions for COP-6. Regarding Parties' submissions, he  noted a decision taken at SBSTA-11 that SBSTA-12 consider  reporting formats for the submission of historical data  and, where applicable, projections. The EU noted that it  had presented a draft data-reporting format prior to SBSTA- 11. AUSTRALIA presented its own proposed data-reporting  format, noting that it takes into account discussions and  conclusions at SBSTA-11. He outlined the proposed data  format and an accounting regime/framework for activities  under Article 3.3 and 3.4.

The US outlined its proposal for a data-reporting format,  noting that it, inter alia: does not specify dates for  historical data; excludes non-CO2 gases on the grounds that  they might be an unnecessary complication; and includes  land area. She said it was important to recognize the  uncertainty of projections, and said Parties should be able  to provide information on the assumptions, and on the  degree to which they may assume additional activities above  business-as-usual.

BRAZIL said the G-77/CHINA would be developing a  negotiating position on this issue in the light of the new  IPCC Special Report. With NORWAY, he supported including  land areas. NORWAY noted the need to try and distinguish  between different stocks. Noting emerging convergence of  views expressed on the data-reporting format, Co-Chair  Thorgeirsson formed a smaller group to consolidate the  proposals.

### MECHANISMS

Workshop Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia)  identified the key features of the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) based on work done on the mechanisms since  COP-5. INDIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, highlighted the  need to first determine the nature and scope of the  mechanisms.

Chair Chow outlined the following steps in the CDM project  cycle: project identification and design; independent  assessment of project design; project submission to the  Executive Board; monitoring; independent assessment and  verification of project performance; and identification and  distribution of certified emission reduction units (CERs).  The REPUBLIC OF KOREA and INDIA sought clarification on the  relationship between the Executive Board and national  authorities. NORWAY and the EU queried the specific  references to the accreditation of Operational Entities in  providing certification.

Chair Chow outlined the functions of the various  institutions. The functions of the Executive Board could  include: registering CDM projects; designating and  accrediting the operational entity; deciding on new  methodologies; and maintaining and updating the CDM  reference manual. The functions of the operational entities  could include: recommending new methodologies to the  Executive Board; validating project designs against the  FCCC standards; and verifying and certifying performance of  CDM projects. He stressed the need to accredit Operational  Entities to ensure integrity and quality, and suggested the  use of existing ISO standards for certification.

Chair Chow introduced the CDM reference manual as a living  document directed at guiding project design. He outlined  the process for updating the manual, and said that it would  make reference, inter alia, to: decisions of the COP/MOP;  agreed standards for accreditation; approved baseline  methodologies; and guidelines for monitoring, verification  and certification. Chair Chow said it would be useful to  have the contents of the manual identified by COP-6. SAMOA  supported the reference manual, as it would ensure  consistency in setting baselines.

CANADA and NORWAY emphasized that the verification and  certification guidelines should provide for individual  project circumstances. INDIA underlined the role of the  host country in determining project eligibility. The EU  asked who would develop the reference manual. SUDAN raised  the need to address basic questions first, such as  eligibility for participation in the CDM. TANZANIA asked  how the reference manual would consider the differing  sustainable development priorities of different countries  and ensure equitable distribution of projects. CHINA  stressed the need for both host and investor Party  responsibilities to be clearly expressed.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates expressed mixed views on the expected nature of  the informal meetings. While some felt they were  experiencing the 'business as usual' atmosphere of formal  subsidiary bodies meetings, others saw the week ahead as a  confidence-building exercise. Although participants were  cautious about predicting the extent of progress likely to  be made on contentious issues before SB-12, many were  generally optimistic.
