# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Slade suggested that delegates focus on five  issues: consequences applied by the enforcement branch;  composition; appeal; relationship between the Compliance Committee  and the COP/MOP; and principles. Developing countries also stated  that unresolved matters include the operation of the facilitative  branch, as proposed in Pronk's text.

On consequences, delegates discussed their nature and whether they  would be legally binding. A group of Annex I Parties favored a  legally binding system with 'rather tough' consequences to deter  Parties from becoming free-riders. Non-Annex I countries, with  others, said legally binding consequences are necessary to address  legally binding commitments. They said the consequences should be  tailored to achieve three objectives: deterrence, restoration, and  ensuring that Parties continue meeting their responsibilities over  the next commitment periods. Some developed countries supported  politically-agreed consequences of a non-punitive nature, while  others favored a legally binding regime with a facilitative, non- punitive approach. One delegate explained that what is 'punitive'  reflects Parties' own perceptions of consequences. One developed  country, opposed by several developing countries, argued against  restricting the right to transfer assigned amount units, and  suggested that the restoration rate of excess tonnes be one for  one. A consultation group, chaired by Jos√© Romero (Switzerland),  was established to follow up on this matter. This group met from  late afternoon, and established a list of unresolved issues with  possible options for consideration by Ministers. It will report  back to the Co-Chairs by Wednesday, 17 July, 12:00 pm.

On the composition of compliance bodies, numerous Parties opposed  the single type of formula proposed in Pronk's text. Developing  country Parties said the composition criterion should be the  equitable geographic representation of the five UN regional  groupings, taking into account the interest groups as reflected by  the current practice in the UNFCCC Bureau. One developing country  explained that this composition would reflect the fact that the  whole community of states had an interest in ensuring compliance.  A number of Annex I Parties said the composition should be  tailored to the mandate of the branch and to the type of  commitments under consideration. One developed country suggested  that, given the quasi-judicial functions of the enforcement  branch, there was a very strong case to move away from drawing  analogies with political bodies, and that only Annex I Parties  should sit on this branch. Another developed country said it would  submit a proposal on this issue at a later stage.

On principles, non-Annex I Parties expressed their opposition to  the approach taken in the Pronk text. They said the facilitative  branch should treat Annex I and non-Annex I Parties differently  and apply different consequences to these two groups. A number of  Annex I Parties supported Pronk's text, with some arguing that the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities does not  only apply between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.

On appeal, delegates expressed diverging views. On the  relationship between the Compliance Committee and the COP/MOP,  developing countries said the issue was closely related to the  possibility of an appeal and of a panel to consider the reports of  experts review teams.

### MECHANISMS

The negotiating group on mechanisms met in the  morning, and completed its first consideration of the negotiating  texts. Delegates compared Pronk's text with the negotiating text  carried forward from The Hague, and identified contentious issues  for consideration in the High Level Ministerial Segment. During  the discussions, a number of delegates expressed their general  support for Pronk's text, subject to further clarification on  technical issues.

Regarding participation in project activities under the Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM), several developing countries welcomed  the removal from Pronk's text of the requirement to submit  national communications. On the issuance of certified emission  reductions (CERs), a developing country questioned the involvement  of CDM institutions in distribution activities, and said 15 days  was too short for issuing CERs. A developing country expressed  concern with the provisions in the Pronk text on the adaptation  fund. On supplementarity and environmental integrity, a developing  country called for new proposals, and noted an earlier proposal by  one Annex I Party on dealing with surplus assigned amounts.

On Joint Implementation (JI), most Annex I Parties supported the  two-track approach adopted in the Pronk text, but differed on the  establishment of a supervisory committee for verifying emissions  reduction units. A number of countries with economies in  transition, opposed by various developing countries, called for  the development of appendices on the procedural elements for JI  during this meeting. On emissions trading, delegates failed to  agree on the level of the commitment period reserve. Developing  countries underlined their concerns with supplementarity and the  adaptation levy, and with the unequal rules governing CDM and  trading. On supplementarity, a grouping of Annex I Parties  indicated a possible willingness to compromise in favor of the  Pronk proposal.

The Co-Chairs said they would develop a new negotiating text with  clearly defined options for consideration during the High Level  Ministerial Segment. The negotiating group will consider a draft  of this text on Wednesday.

### LULUCF

This group met in afternoon and evening sessions. During  the afternoon, delegates were presented with a joint proposal from  Canada, Australia and Japan on the issue of scale in Article 3.4  forest management, and a proposal by New Zealand addressing scale  and additionality in this context. The former proposal relies on  negotiated maximum levels of allowable forest management credits  for individual countries, as opposed to the formula approach taken  in the Pronk text, which includes caps and discount rates. It was  presented as a clear and transparent approach, with levels set  that account for: the Party's national circumstances; the degree  of effort required by the Party to achieve its emissions  limitation; forest management measures the Party is implementing  or planning to implement; and whether it incurs a net source of  emissions under Article 3.3. It was noted that the proposal seeks  to replace only parts of the Pronk text and should be viewed in  concert with it. It applies to the first commitment period only.  One country with an economy in transition joined in supporting the  proposal.

A number of developing countries stated that no additional  activities should be pursued under Article 3.4 during the first  commitment period. One delegate said the proposal constitutes a  renegotiation of the Protocol targets. Another Party stressed the  need to retain the credibility of the process and assure long-run  effective climate protection, and asked what the scale of the  allowed credits might be. One delegate noted that negotiations on  allowable credits should take place during the ministerial segment  in order to pave the way for ratification. Some Parties stressed a  compromise on Article 3.4 as a key to ratification.

The New Zealand proposal was presented as retaining market-based  incentives for improved forest management and CDM activities. It  suggests that a Party including Article 3.4 activities during the  first commitment period either: demonstrates, in accordance with  specific criteria, that additional or improved practices since  1990 have caused a marginal benefit to the atmosphere in  comparison to what would have otherwise occurred; or accounts for  net increases in carbon stocks and net anthropogenic greenhouse  gas removals by sinks up to a level to be negotiated on a country  by country basis.  In addition, a preliminary EU proposal was  presented, supporting the Pronk text but reducing the scale of  Article 3.4 activities.

In an evening session, delegates heard initial reactions to the  three new proposals. Non-Annex I Parties, supported by several  other Parties, highlighted a number of technical and legal  deficiencies and said the Article 3.4 activities must meet all  their proposed Principles, as outlined in The Hague text, in order  to ensure the integrity of the Protocol.

Several Parties underscored the need for a practical and pragmatic  first step as an essential part of a successful outcome of COP-6  Part II, paving the way for Protocol ratification. Co-Chair  Dovland said the Secretariat would draft a conceptual paper for  ministers with regard to activities under Article 3.4 during the  first commitment period, reflecting options ranging from no  activities to options reflecting the Pronk text and the new  proposals including negotiated credits. This would be discussed by  delegates on Wednesday. The group then had a first reading of the  Article 3.3 and 3.4 definitions.

### FINANCIAL ISSUES

This group met in afternoon and evening  sessions. In the afternoon, delegates discussed the development  and transfer of technologies. Participants discussed the Annex,  clearing a number of outstanding brackets. In the section of the  Annex on capacity building, delegates discussed language on steps  by developed country Parties relating to implementation of  capacity building. After brief consultations, they agreed to a  compromise whereby the bracketed word 'additional' was replaced  with 'adequate' in relation to the provision of financial and  technical resources.

On the preambular paragraphs of the draft decision, Parties agreed  to use the three paragraphs proposed in President Pronk's text. At  the urging of developing countries, they added a fourth paragraph  from The Hague text noting that the COP has considered the  recommended framework, presented by the SBSTA Chair as part of the  consultative process, for meaningful and effective actions to  enhance the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology  transfer).

Late afternoon, Parties met in a smaller drafting group to  consider the institutional arrangements for technology transfer.  Delegates agreed to refer to a 'group' rather than a 'panel' of  experts. They expressed diverging views on whether this group  would be advisory or intergovernmental, on its composition, and  whether it should 'assess and evaluate' or merely 'facilitate' the  progress of technology transfer.

The negotiating group reconvened in the evening to discuss text  relating to UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Articles 2.3  and 3.14 (adverse effects). Proceeding through the text carried  forward from The Hague, delegates were able to remove a number of  brackets, including several in the section on the adverse effects  of climate change. Agreements included text on timing for a  request to the SBSTA and SBI to review the progress of activities  on adverse effects outlined under this section, which delegates  agreed should result in recommendations at COP-8. A number of  brackets remained, however.

Delegates then discussed the specific needs and special situations  of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs), including text on the  establishment of an LDC climate change development fund/programme.  After lengthy discussion, delegates agreed to a suggestion by Co- Chair Dechen Tsering (Bhutan) that they consult informally on this  and on some other funding-related language.

On the impact of the implementation of response measures, several  Annex I Parties expressed reservations on developing countries'  preference for deleting language stating that the identification  of initial actions needs to be based on sufficient information and  analysis within a clearly-defined process. Parties also differed  on the appropriate placement of this text, and on whether to use  Pronk's text. This paragraph, and two others on information and  methodologies, remain bracketed.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With the arrival of Ministers on Thursday, delegates have been  feeling the pressure to show concrete results from the first three  days of work. Although many delegates welcomed the initial  progress in the negotiating groups Tuesday and forecast that  Ministers will be able to consider a clear set of options limited  to the key issues, others have expressed caution that the process  may still culminate in the same logjam that occurred during the  Ministerial discussions at The Hague.
