# PLENARY

### MINISTERIAL SEGMENT

Ruth Dreifuss (Switzerland), Chair of  the Ministerial Round Table, noted that a large majority of  ministers had endorsed the results of the SAR and intended  it as a basis for action, though political action is needed  for setting emission limits. She highlighted discussion at  the Round Table session on: the concern of SIDS and African  countries over insufficient resources; the primary role of  developed countries in GHG mitigation; the requirement for  supplementary commitments; the concern of oil-producing  countries about effects on their economies; and the need to  consider a text of a protocol at COP-3.

The Plenary then heard high level statements from  delegations:

### NORWAY

Bernt Bull, Ministry of Environment, outlined a  legally-binding commitment that: recognizes different  industry structures; is equitable and verifiable; is based  on equity, not a flat rate reduction; and utilizes fiscal  measures, e.g. carbon taxes.

### KIRIBATI

Timbo Keariki, Minister of Environment and Social  Development, stressed that the coral atolls that comprise  his nation are three meters above sea level, and urged that  decisions under the FCCC be guided by the need to save the  most vulnerable ecosystems.

### KENYA

John K. Sambu, Minister for Environment and Natural  Resources, highlighted severe droughts and famine in Africa  vis-a-vis global climate change, and called for legally  binding GHG targets and a draft protocol by COP-3. He  criticized GEF conditionality.

### UZBEKISTAN

Victor E. Chub, Minister, Chief of the Main  Administration of Hydrometeorology, highlighted the changing  water balance of the Aral Sea region, calling for energy  efficient technology and regional cooperation.

### ARGENTINA

Maria Julia Alsogaray, Secretary of Natural and  Human Environment, called for a Ministerial Declaration that  is substantive and binding to support the SAR, one based on  consensus that is a 'convergence of opinion', not  necessarily unanimity.

NEW ZEALAND, Simon Upton, Minister for the Environment,  called for a 'global least cost approach' and criticized an  approach based on individual national measures as producing  disparity in abatement costs. A protocol must lead to  equitable marginal abatement costs across borders utilizing  economic instruments.

HUNGARY, Katalin Szili, Parliamentary State Secretary,  Ministry for the Environment and Regional Development,  described national plans to mitigate GHG, and agreed with  the EU position on adoption of legally binding policies and  measures.

### NIGERIA

Dan L. Etete, Minister of Petroleum, stated that  the FCCC cannot use the SAR as a basis for action. He called  for compensation for African countries for economic  consequences of a protocol.

### COLOMBIA

Ernesto Guhl, Vice-Minister of the Environment,  stated that developed countries suffer from the 'disease of  forgetting', referring to commitments made under the Berlin  Mandate. He called for specific mitigation proposals.

### BULGARIA

Yontcho Pelovski, Deputy Minister of the  Environment, described national measures to reduce GHG  emissions. The first national communication utilizes 1988  rather than 1990 base year data, due to a radical drop in  production in 1990 following political changes.

### ITALY

Valerio Calzolaio, Vice Minister for the Environment,  stated that Italy will promote Mediterranean regional  activities as a bridge between Europe and Africa. COP-2 has  two objectives: to speed up the FCCC process and to endorse  the SAR.

### FRANCE

Pierre Chemillier spoke on behalf of Corinne Lepage,  Minister of the Environment, calling it a duty to adopt the  precautionary principle. Many GHG measures require binding  international commitments. She called for a tax on CO2  emissions and a simple differentiation mechanism.

### MALAYSIA

Dato' Abu Bakar Daud, Deputy Minister of Science,  Technology and Environment, called it 'regrettable' that the  AGBM is still exchanging views and is unable to narrow down  policies and measures. He criticized the suggestion by some  Annex I Parties that they be granted flexibility in meeting  emission targets.

### ROMANIA

Ioan Jelev, Department of the Environment,  Secretary of State, supported GHG emission reductions  through improved energy efficiency and the enhancement of  human resources, finance mechanisms, technology transfer and  AIJ.

The EU: Rit Bjerregaard, Commissioner for the Environment,  strongly endorsed the SAR as the basis for a protocol or  other legally binding instrument and urged that the COP take  decisive action. She called on Annex I countries to  implement specific policies and measures and said that the  EU is determined to live up to its commitments and supports  the Ministerial Declaration.

### IVORY COAST

Albert Kakou Tiapani, Minister of Housing,  Quality of Life and Environment, said government awareness  of the effects of climate change must be translated to  action. He called for international solidarity and  encouraged technology sharing and use of the polluter pays  principle.

### URUGUAY

Juan Antonio Chiruchi, Minister of Housing, Land  Settlement and Environment, stressed the need for urgent and  accelerated action and expressed disappointment with Annex I  Parties' lack of compliance with the FCCC. He supported the  adoption of a binding protocol with concrete measures for  GHG emission reductions.

### LITHUANIA

Rapolas Liuzinas, Deputy Minister of the  Environment, noted his country's recent strides in  restructuring its industrial sector for increased energy  efficiency and its commitment to comply with the FCCC.

### GREECE

Dimitri Lalas on behalf of Elissavet Papazoe, Deputy  Minister of the Environment, supported the adoption of a  binding protocol with ambitious targets through 2020 and  noted the need for international cooperation in achieving  targets based on equity principles that address social and  economic impacts.

Due to space constraints, the remainder of the ministerial  statements will be included in the summary edition of the  Earth Negotiations Bulletin.

### MINISTERIAL DECLARATION

In the morning, the President  introduced 'advance text' on the Ministerial Declaration. In  the afternoon, he returned to the issue of the Declaration,  stating that it had emerged from consultations with a  representative group of 'friends of the Chair' overseen by  Canada. The Declaration gave rise to some concerns or  difficulties for some delegations, he said. He added that  some Parties feel that it goes too far and others that it  does not go far enough. A few delegations may be considering  reservations on one or more elements of the text. He  appealed to delegations to reconsider their intentions and  to intervene in a constructive manner. He noted the text  commands a very wide consensus among ministers and other  heads of delegation. He asked the COP to take note of the  Declaration and his introductory remarks, which will be  included in his Report, and to annex the Declaration to the  report of the Conference. This was accepted.

AUSTRALIA said he has been a strong supporter of the FCCC  process and a successful outcome to COP-3. He has worked  hard on the Declaration to take negotiations forward and  contributed to and endorses almost all in the statement. The  delegation has difficulty with the aspect of the text  committing Parties to legally binding targets in a final  legal instrument without the nature and context being clear.  It is further than the negotiation process has taken the  Parties. It is COP-3 where this needs to be decided. With  regret he informed the Chair that Australia cannot associate  itself with the language on targets.

The US said she 'wholeheartedly' endorses the Declaration,  which focuses on three critical points: the need to move  forward on the basis of new and compelling scientific  evidence; the need to focus on legally binding targets as  the next step; and the need to rapidly move the process  forward to complete its critical work by COP-3. She said the  one point not specified was that the negotiated outcome must  ensure maximum national flexibility for all Parties to  implement their medium-term legally binding commitments.  There is also a need to work toward a longer term  concentration goal. To this end, the inclusion of AIJ on a  global basis and international emissions trading must be  part of any future regime. The US believes these views are  fully reflected in the Declaration.

NEW ZEALAND welcomed the strong statement of commitment.  While Parties have to do their fair share of emission  reductions, a way has to be found to reduce the disparity in  abatement costs between countries. A 'global least cost  approach' should be adopted that will be efficient and  equitable. New Zealand has difficulty with a reference  concerning targets in the Declaration and his support must  be qualified by the view that it can only be advanced on the  basis of a least cost approach within Annex I. Parties  should avoid prematurely narrowing the options for the  status of the objectives to be produced by the Berlin  Mandate Process. He asked for his comments to be recorded.

SAUDI ARABIA, on behalf of VENEZUELA, IRAN, KUWAIT,  UAE,  SYRIA, QATAR, JORDAN, The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, NIGERIA, OMAN,  BAHRAIN, SUDAN and YEMEN, reported a lack of transparency  throughout the Conference. He read a formal objection from a  group of Parties to the adoption, approval or acceptance of  the draft Ministerial Declaration due to the: lack of  opportunity for the COP to discuss the draft; failure of the  draft to reflect the views of many Parties as stated by them  at COP-2, with the result that the draft reflects only some  views that exist among the Parties; non-objective  characterization and selective reference to only some of the  information in the SAR, resulting in a draft that is biased  and misleading; and failure to adhere to the customary  procedures of UN bodies and the absence of adoption of rules  of procedure for the COP.

The EU said he fully and unequivocally supported the  Ministerial Declaration. The EU stands ready to take a  constructive role as called for in the Declaration.

GHANA said the FCCC is 'a matter of life and death,' and  noted the need for the Declaration. To object and call the  Declaration misleading is unfortunate. Ghana is not pleased  with language on Annex I implementation.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Two developments at COP-2, the US statement supporting a  legally binding agreement to reduce emissions and the  Ministerial Declaration, drew several reactions from  participants. Regarding the US statement, one delegate  expressed concern about the impact of a requirement for  tradeable emission permits on a binding agreement. Another  delegate mentioned that the AOSIS protocol, and its targets,  could be 'dead in the water'. Regarding the Declaration, one  observer was surprised at the level of dissent, expressed in  heated exchanges between some delegations and the COP  officials, minutes before the Plenary was due to note the  Declaration.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### CLOSING PLENARY
