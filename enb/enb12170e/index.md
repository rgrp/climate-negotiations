# PLENARY

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Delegates met in a morning Plenary session  to address organizational matters and hear the reports from the  Co-Chairs of the four negotiating groups.  The COP noted that  there are 186 Parties to the UNFCCC and that 34 states have  deposited their instruments of ratification or accession to the  Kyoto Protocol. President Pronk added that Vanuatu had recently  ratified the Protocol, and ARGENTINA, SENEGAL, COLOMBIA, the COOK  ISLANDS and BANGLADESH said they had taken similar steps. On the  admission of observers, the COP approved the list of organizations  recommended by the Bureau.

### REPORTS OF THE NEGOTIATING GROUPS

The Co-Chairs of the  negotiating groups then presented their reports.

### Finance:

Co-Chair Ashe reported on the status of the work on  capacity building, technology transfer, guidance to the GEF, and  funding issues. He highlighted bracket-free draft decisions on  capacity building in developing countries and in countries with  economies in transition. On guidance to the GEF, he indicated that  the draft decision reflected agreement on all outstanding matters.  He said agreement had not been reached on funding issues, but an  informal paper on funding and resource levels had been drafted.  Co-Chair Kranjc said discussions on UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and  Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects) had not been completed. He  indicated that an informal paper had been prepared outlining the  agreed and disputed elements of the text. Both Co-Chairs indicated  that consultations on the remaining unresolved issues would  continue.

### Land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF):

Co-Chair Gwage  reported that the group had identified and made progress on three  technical issues. On definitions, he said these could still be  affected by the outcome of political decisions. On Principles, he  suggested the Ministers use the G-77/China proposal as a basis for  their work. On accounting rules for activities eligible under  Protocol Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and  deforestation) and Article 3.4 (additional activities), he said  particular issues under consideration related to slow and fast- growing forests. Co-Chair Gwage then presented the key political  issues, which include: the crediting of Article 3.4 activities  during the first commitment period and the scope of LULUCF  activities under the CDM. He outlined the many options available  to resolve these issues. Co-Chair Dovland emphasized the need to  resolve Article 3.4 issues in order to move forward.

### Mechanisms:

Co-Chair Estrada presented a list of technical and  political issues that need to be resolved. Political issues  include: equity; supplementarity; nuclear; the nature of a  supervisory committee; the composition of the Executive Board; the  share of proceeds for adaptation; the reserve level for the  commitment period for emissions trading; compliance agreement as  an eligibility criterion; unilateral CDM; sinks in the CDM;  Protocol Article 4 (joint fulfillment); special needs of  developing country Parties in the context of the CDM; financial  additionality; and equitable geographic distribution of CDM  projects.

On technical issues, Co-Chair Estrada noted the good progress of  the two relevant working groups. The G-77/CHINA stressed the  importance of equity, environmental integrity, adaptation,  supplementarity, additionality and distribution of CDM projects.  AUSTRALIA and JAPAN said the wording in the mechanisms text  describing the compliance agreement as an eligibility criterion  implied that such an agreement already existed. SAUDI ARABIA  suggested referring expressly to developing country Parties  particularly vulnerable to impacts of adverse effects. JAPAN  proposed that the reference to ODA as meeting financial  obligations, should be considered under financial issues rather  than mechanisms.

### Compliance:

Co-Chair Slade said the compliance report identified  six outstanding issues. He suggested that the resolution of key  political issues - the consequences to be applied by the branches  and the composition of those branches - be given priority. On the  former issue, he highlighted the options identified in the report  on the rate to be applied by the enforcement branch, and the  differentiation between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties in the  consequences to be applied by the facilitative branch.

The COP took note of the Co-Chairs' reports to be forwarded to the  Ministers as an input to their work. COP-6 President Pronk  concluded the meeting by saying he would consult with the  negotiating groups' Co-Chairs and convene an extended Bureau  meeting to strengthen the management process.

# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

COP-6 President Pronk welcomed participants to the ceremonial  opening of the High-Level Segment of the conference. He said  delegates have all the tools needed to complete their work,  including a consolidated, unbracketed text he had prepared to  facilitate an agreement. Emphasizing that the Protocol is 'the  only game in town' and that it is fair and credible, he urged  Parties not to hold back on ratifying because one nation feels it  cannot join.

Barbel Dieckmann, Mayor of Bonn, elaborated on the presence of the  UNFCCC Secretariat and other UN bodies and agencies in Bonn. She  outlined plans to continue increasing the UN presence, including  plans for a new UN campus.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar recalled the  aims of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA), and highlighted  the challenges and needs of developing countries in responding to  climate change. Noting progress in talks during the past few days,  he said it would be a waste to 'abandon the investment' of several  years of negotiations.

Robert Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change, stated that all the scenarios considered for the next  century predict an ongoing increase in carbon dioxide levels, more  extreme weather events, temperature increases, changes in  precipitation, sea level rise, and impacts on agricultural  productivity. He noted that cost-effective technologies exist to  target greenhouse gas emissions. He said the costs of addressing  climate change domestically are estimated at 0.2-2 percent of GDP,  falling even lower if international cooperation occurs.

Representatives of a recent Youth Conference on Climate Change  delivered their views. One speaker urged delegates not to increase  the use of sinks in the Protocol, and said Annex I Parties should  meet at least half of their commitments domestically. A second  speaker told delegates that young people were 'extremely  disappointed with your disregard for our future' at The Hague, and  urged them not to fail at Bonn.

A number of Parties then made general statements. IRAN, for the   G-77/CHINA, expressed concern with the unilateral approach of the  US, and emphasized: preference for three separate decisions on  mechanisms; the need to address adverse effects; support for  legally binding consequences of non-compliance; and the need for  further negotiations on LULUCF. BELGIUM, for the EU, said it is  ready for compromises with all Parties to reach  agreement on a  balanced package that respects: environmental integrity; equity  and solidarity with developing countries; and economic efficiency  and flexibility in meeting the agreed targets. SAMOA, for AOSIS,  emphasized the need for additional funds to undertake adaptation.  The CZECH REPUBLIC, for CG-11, expressed concern with the Pronk  text on financial obligations for Parties included in Annex I and  not included in Annex II, and with proposals for a levy on joint  implementation and emissions trading. MOROCCO expressed his hope  that COP-7 would provide renewed impetus ahead of the Johannesburg  2002 Summit.

AUSTRALIA stated that uncertainty regarding future involvement of  certain states should not stop key issues from being addressed,  and emphasized: the non-discriminatory rules on sinks; a  compliance system that assists Parties rather than punishes non- compliance; and the launch of dialogue on action with developing  countries. CANADA underlined the importance of efficient and  accessible market mechanisms, the role of forests and agriculture,  and the need to encourage developing country action.

Underlining the importance of US participation, JAPAN said she is  proactively engaged in consultations with the US, but that this  should not delay progress in this session. She said JAPAN will  exert its utmost efforts to make it possible for many countries,  including itself, to conclude the Protocol, aiming at entry into  force by 2002. The US said it intends to address climate change in  a 'serious, sensible and science-based manner' and would not  prevent others from going ahead with the Protocol 'so long as they  do not harm legitimate US interests.' SWITZERLAND, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, said sinks  should be of a limited scale, mechanisms should complement  domestic action, and there should be a strong compliance regime  with legally binding consequences. CHINA noted a document  outlining its achievements to address climate change. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION emphasized the need for simplicity in the mechanisms,  including sinks and nuclear, and expressed concern with proposals  on financial issues.

# INFORMAL HIGH-LEVEL PLENARY

President Pronk opened the first meeting of the Informal High- Level Plenary on Thursday evening, stressing that participants are  here to resolve the political issues related to the BAPA. He  invited the Co-Chairs of the four negotiating groups to present  their reports on the key outstanding issues and options for  resolving them. He said the four reports were being combined into  one streamlined document available Friday morning. On the further  process, including negotiations in smaller groups, President Pronk  said the extended Bureau would meet Thursday night to take  decisions.

On mechanisms, Co-Chair Estrada identified the major issues  requiring a political decision. Co-Chair Dovland highlighted two  key questions related to LULUCF - whether there should be credits  for activities under Article 3.4 during the first commitment  period, and whether there should be credits for LULUCF activities  under the project-based mechanisms. In presenting the report of  the compliance group, Co-Chair Slade outlined the available  options relating to the consequences and the composition of the  branches. He said the resolution of both matters would pave the  way to agreement on other issues. On financial issues, Co-Chairs  Ashe and Kranjc presented an overview of the questions and options  to be addressed by Ministers.

President Pronk encouraged Ministers to approach these questions  with 'political eyes,' no longer repeating well-known positions,  but taking a step back to consider the options of other groups and  those outlined in his text. He said each issue should be viewed as  a possible element of an overall deal, and called on Ministers to  think in terms of the full package and make decisions accordingly.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Much of the discussion in the corridors Thursday night was on the  process for the ministerial segment. On the substance of  negotiations, some participants expressed optimism regarding  President Pronk's approach of focusing on the highest political  issues, which are being articulated to Ministers through very  specific questions with a limited number of options. However,  delegates appear to remain divided on the ongoing problem of how  the negotiations should proceed in organizational terms.  Participants in a meeting of the extended Bureau late Thursday  night left without resolving process questions such as  negotiations in small groups, and transparency and representation  in meetings.

The EU's likely strategy going into the ministerial discussions  has also been a topic of conversation. In particular, participants  have been speculating what its 'bottom lines' might be, and how  far they may 'bend' to accommodate the demands of Umbrella Group  countries.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### PLENARY

A High-Level Plenary is likely to convene following a  meeting of the extended Bureau, which is scheduled for 10:00 am.  The Bureau will report to Plenary on its talks on the way forward.  New streamlined text will be available in the morning.
