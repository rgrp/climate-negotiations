# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

On the second review of the adequacy of Article 4.2 (a) and (b).  VENEZUELA, for the G-77/CHINA and supported by TOGO, said that:  COP-4's second review must respect the FCCC mandate, as set out  in Article 2(d); COP-4's review must not be distracted by  extraneous consideration of new commitments for non-Annex I  Parties; COP-4 should convene the next review at the same time  as the review at COP/MOP-2 in accordance with Article 9.2 of the  Protocol; and subsequent reviews should take place in the year  preceding the termination of successive Protocol commitment  periods.

The US asked the G-77/CHINA if the intention was only to confine  discussion of the second review to that agenda item at COP-4;  and about the timing of the next and subsequent reviews. The G-77/CHINA said the second review should be limited to that  foreseen in Article 4; it would be logical to hold the next  review at the same time as COP/MOP-2; and indicated flexibility  on timing of subsequent reviews. The US said one of the bases of  the inadequacy of Articles 4.2 (a) and (b) is the insufficient  number of Parties subject to those commitments. Referring to  newly industrialized countries, he noted an interest in  exploring ways to move beyond the static world created by the  Annex I list. A way to modify the Annexes was needed. HUNGARY  said the timing of reviews should not be linked to the  unratified Kyoto Protocol. SAUDI ARABIA recalled the existing  FCCC provision for any Party to undertake Annex I commitments.  PERU said the Kyoto Protocol was a very delicate balance.  Raising developing country commitments at COP-4 would be a  danger for the international community and for the environment.  CHINA said the G-77/China position clearly stated that  developing countries would not accept new commitments under any  guise.

MEXICO said questions on OECD membership are inappropriate.  VENEZUELA stated that 4.2(d) only calls for review of  commitments under 4.2(a) and (b). The EU noted those commitments  are inadequate. AOSIS said that Parties should not distract from  Protocol implementation, noting the CDM will assist sustainable  growth with climate protection. The Chair asked Canada and  Zimbabwe to co-chair a contact group to prepare a draft  decision.

On arrangements for intergovernmental meetings  (FCCC/SBI/1998/3), the Executive Secretary announced Jordan's  offer to host COP-5. ARGENTINA noted ongoing informal  consultations on a new COP-4 item on voluntary commitments by  non-Annex I Parties. The PHILIPPINES requested a separate item  on review of development and transfer of technologies (Decision  7/COP-2).

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVICE

On the roster of experts, CANADA, the UK, the US and NEW ZEALAND  called for regular reviews as well as inclusion of gender  considerations.

In response to a query from ETHIOPIA on the fate of previous  submissions to the roster, the Chair noted that the compilation  was an ongoing process. BOTSWANA stressed the need for adequate  time for notifying and inviting the experts, and, supported by  CHINA, stressed the need for regional distribution of experts.  TOGO sought clarification on the absence of 'air' from the areas  of expertise.

Delegates considered the scientific and methodological aspects  of a proposal made by Brazil (FCCC/AGBM/1997/Misc.3/Add.1)  during the AGBM process and forwarded by COP-3 to SBSTA. BRAZIL  recalled that the proposal contained a clean development fund  that has been replaced by the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM). The proposal contained a technical and  scientific aspect that establishes a methodology for linking the  historical responsibility for increasing global temperature with  the responsibility for lowering emissions. He proposed a contact  group to consider the issue at this meeting and announced his  government will convene an expert meeting soon. CHINA said the  proposal highlights the 'real' relative responsibility of Annex  I and non-Annex I countries.

GREENPEACE said some of the methodology needs enhancement,  noting that the proposal contains no methodology for several  technical and policy assumptions. He said further development  would be useful for the second review of adequacy of  commitments.

The EU, the US, SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA said the proposal  requires broader discussion and expressed concern about, inter  alia: the method for reconstructing historical emissions;  indicators that ignore the rate of change; and the availability  of data.

On additional methodological issues for consideration by SBSTA,  SWITZERLAND queried how the proposal by Brazil can be included  under the Convention. The meeting decided that a small group  comprising (those who raised questions) work together in  proposing concrete suggestions on advancing the proposal  further. SWITZERLAND raised the issue of expert post reviews and  evaluation of GHG inventories, and proposed a set of decisions  for COP-4, which included calls for consideration of aerosols  from combustion of fossil fuels, biomass burning and other  greenhouse gas precursors as highlighted by the SAR; and the  ratification of, and negotiation for a protocol to the  Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution.

# AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13 (AG13)

On Friday, delegates began consideration of the heavily  bracketed draft text from the last AG13 session (AG13-5). Chair  Patrick Sz√©ll (UK) recalled that during AG13-5, delegates agreed  that the MCP should be advisory rather than supervisory in  nature. They also agreed that AG13 should complete its work by  COP-4. He stressed that the meeting will discuss only the MCP  and not the Protocol.

On paragraph 12, delegates debated who could trigger the MCP:  one or more Parties, the COP, SBI or SBSTA, and/or the  Secretariat. GHANA, IRAN and SINGAPORE said there was no need to  include the other subsidiary bodies. The US, GHANA, ZIMBABWE,  CANADA, the EU, AUSTRALIA and IRAN said the Secretariat should  not be included. Regarding information from the Secretariat,  delegates debated, inter alia, whether it would seek information  upon request or on its own volition.

There was no agreement on whether one country could raise  questions regarding another country. Many delegations recalled  that the MCP was to be non-confrontational. The Chair sought  language denoting that presenting questions to the MCP had only  positive connotations. CANADA, supported by the US, suggested  that raising the number of Parties necessary to trigger the MCP  would make it less confrontational. The EU disagreed. Delegates  also debated language on supplying relevant information when  triggering the MCP.

On paragraph 2 (objective of the MCP), many delegates stated  that this issue could only be resolved once the mandate of the  Committee (paragraph 5) is agreed. Delegates also discussed the  proposed language changes in paragraph 5 and underscored the  importance of clarity. They did not resolve what kind of  assistance (technical, consultative or financial) the Committee  will provide to Parties. On paragraph 6, AUSTRALIA suggested  that the Committee should not duplicate activities performed by  other Convention 'processes' as opposed to Convention bodies.  GHANA suggested that the question go to a drafting group.

On paragraph 1, (establishment of the MCP), the EU, supported by  GHANA, the US and AOSIS, preferred a 'standing' Multilateral  Consultative Committee reporting to the COP. A bracketed  reference to the SBI was deleted. In paragraph 3 (nature of the  MCP), delegates debated the description of the MCP as  'transparent.' Following discussion, the Chair invited the US to  draft an interpretive statement for inclusion in the AG13  report, indicating that transparency should be understood as a  reference to the overall process and outcome and not to the  question of access to meetings. The Chair also proposed a  drafting group, coordinated by Zimbabwe, to consider drafting  questions.

AG13 discussion continued on Saturday. Regarding paragraph 4  (nature of the MCP), AUSTRALIA raised the possibility of  duplication by the MCP of other FCCC dispute settlement work.  The EU, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES and IRAN noted the MCP's purpose is  advisory only.

Paragraphs 7 (Committee size) and 9 (Committee Constitution)  were considered jointly. Delegates generally agreed to: limit  the number of participants in the MCC, rotate terms of two or  three years; and permit the other subsidiary bodies' Chairs to  participate as observers. They were divided over exact  membership numbers, with the EU, SLOVENIA, the US and others  favoring under 15 members while the G-77/CHINA called for 25  members. Most delegates accepted unbracketed text on equitable  geographical distribution among regions, but the US proposed  dividing membership equally between Annex I and Annex II.  Language allowing for a roster of experts in paragraph 9 was not  supported.

On paragraph 8 (expertise), delegates agreed, based on proposals  from GHANA and the EU, the Committee should comprise persons  nominated by governments who are experts in relevant fields,  such as science, socio-economics and the environment.

ZIMBABWE, for the drafting group, reported that Parties agreed  to remove brackets from paragraph 2 (objective), which is to  resolve questions regarding implementation of the FCCC. The  process will provide for advice on assistance to Parties to  overcome difficulties in their implementation, promote  understanding of the FCCC, and prevent disputes.

In paragraph 12 (taking up issues), ZIMBABWE said the four  subparagraphs remain in brackets. The US queried the decision  not to specify the SBI and SBSTA. SLOVENIA suggested that a  Party raise questions with respect to its own implementation. On  paragraph 5 (mandate), Parties debated the implications of a  reference to provision of 'the' appropriate assistance.

In paragraph 10 (deliberations), the EU, supported by SLOVENIA  and GHANA, proposed that the Committee meet 'at least once a  year.' Responding to US concerns, delegates accepted an EU  proposal to merge paragraphs 10 (deliberations) and 11  (governance). On paragraph 11, the EU, supported by GHANA,  preferred that the Committee report to each session of the COP,  and agreed to deletion of a reference to the SBI. On paragraph  13 (outcome), GHANA, supported by the EU, proposed deleting  'encouragement' from the elements to be included in conclusions  and recommendations. The Chair noted deletion of the SBI. The US  questioned an EU proposal to end the paragraph with: 'with a  view to the COP taking whatever decisions it considers  necessary.' The US suggested that the paragraph be consistent  with the Committee's mandate and publication of recommendations.  CANADA raised majority voting and provision for minority  decisions.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Participants in the contact group on flexibility mechanisms  reported little progress, particularly on emissions trading.  Some delegates see emissions trading as unworkable without a  strong monitoring network, but fear the costs of monitoring an  international trading system could be exorbitant. In addition,  much discussion in a five-hour G77/China caucus on Saturday  focused on emissions trading and entitlements. Several argued  strongly for per capita entitlements but no proposal has yet  appeared. The Land Use Change and Forestry contact group  reportedly reached tentative agreement on what could be  delivered by COP-4.
