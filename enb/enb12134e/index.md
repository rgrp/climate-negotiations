# SBSTA

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Bert Metz, IPCC, outlined key  conclusions of the IPCC Special Report on Technology  Transfer. Chair Dovland said the Friends of the Chair group  had begun to identify priority areas for a COP-6 decision.

Several delegates underscored the importance of capacity  building for technology transfer. The EU and JAPAN stressed  co-ordination of existing sources of funding. The EU,  JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and CANADA underlined the CDM's role in  advancing technology transfer to developing countries.  CHINA, supported by several delegates, opposed any  suggestion that the CDM could replace technology transfer  under the FCCC. MAURITIUS suggested using specialized and  professional bodies to monitor technology transfer  projects.

Several developing countries supported the G-77/CHINA's  call for the formation of a contact group at this session,  while the US, AUSTRALIA, SWITZERLAND and CANADA preferred  forming it at SB-13. The US, MALAYSIA and SWITZERLAND said  the Special Report could provide guidance in continuing the  work on implementing FCCC Article 4.5 (technology  transfer).

On other matters, John Houghton, IPCC, presented a paper on  the applicability of regional climate models at the scale  of small island states, highlighting that despite progress  in regional modeling, much uncertainty remains.

### COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

Delegates  heard reports from the FCCC Secretariat, IPCC, Global  Climate Observing System (GCOS), WHO, the Ramsar Convention  on Wetlands and UNDP. SWITZERLAND invited governments to  contribute to funding the IPCC. A number of delegates  underlined the capacity building aspects of the GCOS  regional workshops, and the need to maintain the political  independence of the IPCC.

### 'BEST PRACTICE' IN POLICIES AND MEASURES

Delegates  emphasized the importance of policies and measures (P&Ms)  in ensuring implementation of Protocol commitments, and  supported proposals for future workshops. The EU  highlighted the importance of, inter alia, considering  different national and sectoral circumstances when  evaluating P&Ms, and quantifying the effectiveness of Annex  I Parties' domestic action. SWITZERLAND, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, proposed that a contact group be established  using the Chair's consolidated text as a basis for  discussion.

### METHODS AND TOOLS TO EVALUATE IMPACTS AND ADAPTATION

The  PHILIPPINES and the GAMBIA stressed focusing attention on  new and effective adaptation technologies. The EU, and  others, suggested organizing the workshop proposed by the  Secretariat with IPCC, preferably after COP-6 and after the  completion of the work of the IPCC Third Assessment Report.  CHINA and AOSIS called for COP-6 resolutions supporting  capacity building in developing countries.

On other methodological issues, the Secretariat reviewed  recent meetings with the International Civil Aviation  Organization and the International Maritime Organization,  on GHG emissions from international transportation, noting  that SBSTA-13 will address this issue.

On implementation of FCCC Article 6 (education, training  and public awareness), the Secretariat reported that it had  received only five national submissions. The CENTRAL  AFRICAN REPUBLIC, with others, advocated that Article 6 be  a separate SBSTA agenda item.

# SBI

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Many delegates  thanked the French Government for its offer to host SB-13.  The SBI endorsed MOROCCO's offer to host COP-7 in  Marrakesh.

On COP-6, the NETHERLANDS called for progress on all  aspects of the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. Relaying a  message from the incoming COP-6 President, he said the  outcome of COP-6 must be environmentally credible and based  on common but differentiated responsibilities. On the  provisional agenda for COP-6, the US, RUSSIAN FEDERATION  and SAUDI ARABIA said the proposed new sub-item on P&Ms  should await SBSTA's consideration. SAUDI ARABIA urged full  transparency and participation at COP-6, and INDONESIA  called for full participation of developing countries  before and during COP-6.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

On Implementation of  the Headquarters Agreement, FCCC Executive Secretary  Cutajar raised several issues with regard to integration  with the host country, including work/residency status and  lack of office space. The G-77/CHINA expressed concern over  this situation. GERMANY said it would do its utmost to  improve the situation. MEXICO and COSTA RICA suggested a  draft decision for COP-6 consideration urging GERMANY to  strengthen cooperation with the Secretariat.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Many delegates supported the Co-Chairs' text as the basis  for the JWG's work. The EU, US, SWITZERLAND and SAMOA said  some elements in the Annexes might need to be included in  the text. On the title, the US favored a reference to  'procedures and mechanisms related to compliance under the  Kyoto Protocol,' since there are other provisions in the  Protocol dealing with compliance. The EU preferred 'a  compliance system for the Kyoto Protocol' in order to  reflect a comprehensive approach to addressing compliance.

On Objective, a number of delegates supported inclusion of  'enforcing' compliance. The G-77/CHINA favored simpler text  referring to 'compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.' The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION, opposed by the US, suggested referring  to promoting achievement of the FCCC's ultimate objective.  SAUDI ARABIA sought a reference to compliance with  obligations contained in Protocol Articles 2 (P&Ms) and 3  (targets). AUSTRALIA suggested the compliance system focus  on both Articles 3.1 and 4.1 (joint fulfillment). The EU  favored a general reference to the Party's 'obligations  under the Kyoto Protocol.' On Principles, AUSTRALIA, the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION, the US, JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND preferred  that these not be expressly provided for in the text.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Chair Mahmoud Ould el  Ghaouth (Mauritania) proposed a draft 'Late Payment of  Contributions: Response Options' to be transmitted to SB-13  as an initial draft text. IRAN, with GERMANY, BELGIUM and  AUSTRALIA, called for in-depth consideration of the issue.  IRAN opposed transmitting the text to SB-13. He said the  cornerstone of the approach to late payment should be  persuasion, not punishment, and that the matter should be  addressed in the spirit of common but differentiated  responsibilities. The NETHERLANDS, with CANADA, favored  applying the same approach to all Parties, including an  incentive scheme. He said the principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities applied only in assessing  the level of contribution.

### LULUCF

Delegates discussed draft conclusions that, inter  alia: included the format for 1 August submissions;  requested Parties to address how their proposed additional  activities relate to suggested criteria and guiding  principles; and invited SBSTA to convene an additional  inter-sessional meeting prior to COP-6. On the Special  Report, delegates expressed diverging views on whether to  add a phrase on the IPCC lead authors' input during the  pre-sessional week and on the potential to continue this  practice. On criteria and guiding principles, the EU  suggested reference to the objectives, principles and  relevant provisions of the FCCC and Protocol. The US and  AUSTRALIA opposed inclusion of 'relevant provisions,'  noting that this would imply requirements rather than  guidance. On the proposed additional meeting, BOLIVIA  stressed the need to ensure sufficient participation of  non-Annex I Parties, and the G-77/CHINA called for regional  workshops. AOSIS cautioned against progressing with draft  decisions during the inter-sessional meeting/workshop.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Stressing that this was simply a  discussion to identify and develop further ideas and key  elements as a basis for negotiation, Co-Chair Salamat  sought substantive comments on the consolidated text.

On the adverse effects of climate change, many delegates  endorsed the need to improve data and information  gathering, and systematic observation and monitoring.  Several Annex I Parties supported an integrated and  priority-based approach and emphasized the need for a set  of guiding principles. The UK stressed the need to avoid  maladaptation. The G-77/CHINA proposed adding, inter alia:  the need for training in specialized fields; establishment  of regional centers to facilitate a rapid response to  natural disasters; and improved monitoring and forecasting  of disease vectors. The US and CANADA stressed the needs of  least developed countries.

On impacts of response measures, BRAZIL proposed a workshop  to help further develop economic models. SAUDI ARABIA said  the text should refer to actions by Annex I, not Annex II  Parties. LIBYA proposed a reference to support for economic  diversification in developing countries dependent on fossil  fuel production. The US proposed text based on an iterative  process, drawing on experiences. On text relating  specifically to Protocol Article 3.14, the UNITED ARAB  EMIRATES added reference to compensation, funding and  insurance.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

The countries with economies in  transition (EITs) submitted amendments to the section on  principles in the Chair's paper on capacity building in  EITs, and noted that discussions on other section were  ongoing. Participants sought the Chair's guidance on: how  the contact group's work would proceed; whether discussions  would proceed on the basis of the EIT submission or the  Chair's paper; and how capacity needs emerging from other  discussions would be included in the framework elaborated  by the group. They discussed the submission, including: the  principle that all needs are addressed in a coordinated  manner, and the EITs' immediate needs.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates discussed the revised Chairs'  draft conclusions on Guidelines under Protocol Articles 5,  7 and 8. SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA, disagreed with  the draft conclusions that propose forwarding guidelines  for national systems under Article 5.1 (national systems)  for consideration by SBI-13. He requested more time for  consideration of the guidelines. Several delegates  underscored the need to move forward as planned, noting  that the guidelines have been under consideration for  several months. In response to a request by Co-Chair  Paciornik, the G-77/CHINA agreed to discuss, consult and  provide feedback. Delegates then discussed minor changes to  the remaining conclusions. The Secretariat highlighted the  structure of a draft COP-6 decision, which would recommend  the adoption of guidelines for national systems under  Article 5.1 by COP/MOP-1.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The Friends of the Chair group agreed  on five themes for action emerging from the consultative  process: technology needs and needs assessment; technology  information; enabling environments; capacity building; and  mechanisms for technology transfer. They also began  identifying the main areas for action under these themes.
