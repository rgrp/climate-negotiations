Contact groups on P&Ms, R&SO, the Consultative Group of Experts  (CGE), and afforestation and reforestation activities under the  CDM also convened in the evening. Informal contact groups also met.

# SBSTA

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Activities implemented jointly: The  Secretariat introduced a synthesis report, noting the submission  of five new AIJ projects, bringing the total number of projects to  157.

###     LULUCF under the CDM

The FAO reported on a recent workshop on  forest-related definitions that aimed to establish a framework for  a new carbon terminology rather than to standardize definitions.  MALAYSIA stressed ensuring the environmental integrity of CDM  projects. BRAZIL supported developing 'a common language.' The US  and EU supported the Colombian tonne-year accounting approach.  Opposing Canada's SBSTA-16 proposal to change the baseline from  1989, the EU stressed its support for definitions set out in the  Marrakesh Accords. COLOMBIA said the 1989 baseline could impede  projects. JAPAN said that rules for sinks under the CDM should not  be unnecessarily restrictive, and proposed that definitions and  modalities should be agreed as a package at COP-9. SENEGAL, for  the Africa Group, said definitions and modalities should be  flexible and applicable to the local ecological context. She  stressed links with combating poverty and desertification. TUVALU,  for AOSIS, stressed the need for social and environmental project  impact assessments. Chair Thorgeirsson said a contact group would  be convened under Thelma Krug (Brazil) and Karsten Sach (Germany).

###     Scientific and methodological aspects of the Brazilian proposal

The Secretariat highlighted a recent expert meeting. BRAZIL  highlighted attribution of causes and consequences when assessing  contributions to climate change. Opposed by SAUDI ARABIA and  supported by MEXICO and the EU, he recommended renewing SBSTA's  mandate on this issue. The US, CANADA and AUSTRALIA expressed  concern about the lack of rigour of research on attribution.  Consultations will be conducted by Murray Ward (New Zealand) and  Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil).

###     Issues relating to HFCs and PFCs

On the relationship between  efforts to protect the ozone layer and the global climate system,  the IPCC and Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) of  the Montreal Protocol reported on the development of a Special  Report on practices and technologies to assist Parties with issues  relating to alternatives to ozone-depleting substances. Many  Parties supported a single integrated report to be completed by  COP-11. AUSTRALIA stressed that future work should be policy  neutral, not prescriptive. Richard Bradley (US) will conduct  consultations on draft SBSTA conclusions and a draft COP decision.

###     Research and systematic observation

Chair Thorgeirsson said a  substantive dialogue with the IPCC and international research body  representatives on research recommendations provided in the TAR  would be held during a side event on Monday, 28 October. The SBSTA  heard presentations and research updates by the World Climate  Research Programme, the International Geosphere-Biosphere  Programme, the International Human Dimensions Programme and the  Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Parties exchanged views on  priority topics, with Chair Thorgeirsson noting convergence on:  impacts, vulnerability and adaptation; adaptive capacity and  adaptation options; risk assessment and management; resource  management in the context of climate change; ways to deal with  uncertainty; and stabilization pathways. On systematic observation,  he noted support for a voluntary donor fund for GCOS. He said a  contact group will be convened by Sue Barrell (Australia) and S.K.  Srivastav (India).

### IPCC TAR

Several Parties supported exploring ways to use  information contained in the TAR. The EU, opposed by the US and  MALAYSIA for G-77/CHINA, proposed an agenda item on the  methodological issues relating to the stabilization of greenhouse  gas emissions. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would prepare  conclusions.

### P&MS

Chair Thorgeirsson reported on intersessional consultations,  noting agreement that the next steps should include strengthening  web-based approaches for exchanging information and further work  on developing and sharing self-evaluations of P&Ms. A contact  group co-chaired by Peer Stiansen (Norway) and Suk-Hoon Woo  (Republic of Korea) was convened.

# SBI

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The EU requested the SBSTA to  consider including reporting on P&Ms and proposed that the fourth  national communications be submitted on 4 January, 2006, to  coincide with the reporting process on demonstrable progress.  CANADA, supported by the US, said that it would be premature to  undertake major revisions to the guidelines. INDIA emphasized  strengthening the reporting process for Annex I Parties. Chair  Estrada said he would produce recommendations for the SBI based on  consultations with delegates.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

The GEF reported agreement on the third  replenishment and approval of the administrative and operational  procedures for the new climate change funds. The Secretariat  introduced the report on the review of the financial mechanism  highlighting: the transparency of decision making; adequacy,  predictability and disbursement of funds; the amount of resources  for developing countries; and the sustainability of GEF projects.  Several Parties stressed streamlining the GEF project cycle and  operationalizing the Special Climate Change and LDC Funds.

IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern about the  conditionality of GEF funding. TUVALU and ERITREA noted problems  in the communication process between the financial mechanism and  the implementing agencies. KENYA called for increased assistance  for adaptation projects and the development of climate policies  and strategies. CANADA commended the GEF on its adaptation  strategy. BANGLADESH expressed concern about the uneven regional  distribution of funding. Chair Estrada cautioned against possible  inconsistencies between COP guidance to the GEF and GEF decisions  on modalities.

The GEF said that work on operationalizing the LDC Fund was  underway. He noted that the GEF is prepared to adopt more detailed  guidance on impacts and adaptation activities, if instructed to do  so by the COP. He said resource constraints could be alleviated if  projects addressed several conventions. The WORLD BANK, as one of  the three implementing agencies of the GEF, informed delegates  about the increased efficiency of its work, highlighted some  possible sources of inefficiency, and noted that its  administration fee is relatively low. Chair Estrada said he would  prepare a text on the review of the financial mechanism.

On funding under the UNFCCC, the GEF noted that its current  operational procedures would apply to the Special Climate Change  Fund until the COP provides additional guidance. He stressed the  importance of identifying sources of financing for this Fund.  Chair Estrada requested the Secretariat to prepare guidelines for  consideration by the SBI. On additional guidance to the operating  entity of the financial mechanism, UGANDA, supported by GHANA,  INDIA, SAUDI ARABIA and BANGLADESH, called for capacity-building  for national focal points and for technology transfer. Chair  Estrada requested the Secretariat to prepare a draft decision for  the SBI's consideration.

### CACAM

Chair Estrada noted a lack of consensus on the proposal  from the CACAM group of countries, but said that Parties agree  that the countries should be able to access financial resources  provided for in UNFCCC decisions. UZBEKISTAN, for the CACAM group,  proposed the definition 'developing countries and other countries  not included in Annex I.' CANADA, with the EU, and opposed by  INDIA, said the proposed adjustment in the definition would be  required for the CACAM group to gain representation on the Expert  Group on Technology Transfer.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

The Secretariat presented  its reports on administrative and financial matters. CANADA,  supported by SWITZERLAND and BULGARIA, urged Parties to ensure  early payment of contributions. He requested the Secretariat to  provide its budget requirements for the activities relating to  implementation of the Marrakesh Accords. Chair Estrada will draft  conclusions on this issue.

### OTHER MATTERS

CROATIA noted the proposal for its forest cap and  suggested that the issue be deferred pending the outcome of  negotiations in the SBSTA. CANADA, opposed by the EU, supported  the Croatian proposal and requested further information on the  assessment of the forest cap.

### CAPACITY-BUILDING

BULGARIA, on behalf of the Central Group of  Eleven (CG-11), called for further consultations to develop a  future framework for the economies in transition. TANZANIA, for G-77/CHINA, expressed concern that the COP-7 decision had not been  implemented by the GEF and its developed country partners.  Discussions continued into the night.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### P&MS

Co-Chair Stiansen asked for views on possible future actions.  Several developing country Parties objected to voluntary  information exchange on developing country P&Ms, and expressed  concern at the lack of information presently available on adverse  effects. Parties agreed on the need for further work on assessment  methodologies.

### CGE

Chaired by José Romero, this group discussed the improvement  of guidelines for the preparation of national communications from  non-Annex I Parties. Parties agreed to use text prepared by the G-77/China as the basis for discussion. SBI Chair Estrada  underscored the need for clear indications within the guidelines  of the COP's intentions with regard to additional financial inputs  by the GEF. Parties discussed which articles to take into account  in the guidelines' objectives.

### R&SO

Co-Chairs Barrell and Srivastav led discussions, which  focused on the importance of funding to achieve improvement in  systematic observation systems. Several Parties supported the  Australian proposal for a GCOS-administered fund directed at high- priority needs, to be further discussed in conjunction with the  forthcoming report on adequacy of observation systems. The co- chairs will provide draft conclusions for discussion Friday.

### LULUCF UNDER THE CDM

Co-Chairs Krug and Sach led procedural  discussions on definitions and modalities for afforestation and  reforestation activities under the CDM. Delegates agreed to focus  on technical issues. Some Parties expressed concern regarding the  lack of consensus on definitions.

### REVIEW OF METHODOLOGICAL WORK OF INVENTORY GUIDELINES

Chaired by  Harald Dovland (Norway), the informal contact group on  methodological review agreed on outstanding issues and draft  conclusions.
