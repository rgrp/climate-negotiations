# SBSTA

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates considered the Chair's draft  conclusions on guidelines for the preparation of Annex I  communications (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.4). SBSTA amended a paragraph  calling on Parties to report on significant technology transfer  success stories to also include reference to failures. The  document was adopted and forwarded to SBI for its recommendation  for adoption by COP-5.

On 'best practices' in policies and measures relating to Annex I  communications, Chair Dovland (Norway) said further informal  consultations would continue, as agreement on draft conclusions  had not been reached.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

SBSTA adopted the Chair's  draft conclusions on research and systematic observation  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.3) and recommended a decision to the COP that  it, inter alia, urge Parties to identify capacity building needs  and funding requirements in developing countries to enable them to  collect, exchange and utilize data continuously in pursuance of  the FCCC.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

On the status of the consultative process  relating to the development and transfer of technologies  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.2), delegates recommended a decision to the  COP to, inter alia, extend the consultative process until COP-6  and invite non-Annex I Parties to report on their technology needs  in their national communications.

Delegates adopted the Chair's draft conclusions on: coastal  adaptation technologies (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.21); other matters  relating to the Secretariat's cooperation activities with the  OECD's Development Assistance Committee to provide comprehensive  data (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.18); and ways and means of limiting  emissions of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.7).

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

The Chair's draft conclusions on national  systems, adjustments and guidelines under Protocol Articles 5  (methodology), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of  information) were adopted after agreement was reached on several  minor amendments proposed by the EU.

On the draft conclusions on emissions resulting from fuel used for  international transportation (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.5), further  informal consultations were scheduled after the G-77/CHINA said it  had been unable to participate in the drafting group working on  this issue due to the heavy workload at COP-5. He noted many areas  of concern and said the G-77/CHINA needed time to develop its  position.

Delegates adopted unamended the Chair's draft conclusions on: the  impact of single projects on emissions in the commitment period  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.17); information on impacts and adaptation  assessment methods (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.12); and the estimation of  emissions of carbon dioxide from forest harvesting and wood  products (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/CRP.6). Delegates also adopted draft  conclusions on scientific and methodological aspects of the  proposal by Brazil (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.13).

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

SBSTA  adopted draft conclusions on cooperation with relevant  international organizations relating to: scientific organizations  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.15); United Nations bodies  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.19); and other conventions  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.20).

SBSTA also adopted the Chair's draft conclusions relating to the  roster of experts nominated by Parties (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.16).  Delegates then heard brief presentations from the FAO and the  National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC)  on issues relevant to SBSTA's activities.

# SBI

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates adopted the draft conclusions on  greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory data (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.9), on the  reporting guidelines referred to it by SBSTA (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.8)  and on guidelines for the technical review of GHG inventories  (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.9).

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

On the financial mechanism, SBI accepted the  Chair's conclusions on the report of the Global Environmental  Facility (GEF)  and the input from Parties to the GEF's review of  enabling activities (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.10).

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

On arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings, delegates adopted the draft conclusion  on improving the intergovernmental process. On the date and venue  of COP-6 and the calendar of meetings of Convention bodies  (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.14), SAUDI ARABIA objected to having two  intersessional meetings instead of one, noting the difficulties  with financing developing countries' participation. He proposed  delaying the decision until the financial issues had been  addressed. AUSTRALIA, the US and the EU supported the calendar of  events. SBI noted the objection by SAUDI ARABIA and adopted the  draft conclusions and annexed draft decision.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

SBI adopted the draft  conclusions and recommended draft decisions to the COP on the  programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001  (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.12), and on the income and budget performance  in the biennium 1998-1999 (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.13). Delegates also  adopted the Chair's draft conclusions on arrangements for  administrative support to the FCCC, institutional linkage of the  FCCC Secretariat to the UN and the implementation of the  Headquarters Agreement.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates considered SBI's  recommendation on matters related to non-Annex I communications  (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.10 and Add.1), which includes the terms of  reference of the consultative group (CG) of experts on non-Annex I  national communications. INDIA and CHINA proposed deletion of a  paragraph that calls on the CG to consider steps taken or  envisaged by the Party to implement the FCCC. The recommendations  were adopted unamended. Delegates also adopted the Chair's draft  conclusions  on the provision of financial and technical support  for non-Annex I national communications (FCCC/SBI/1999/CRP.11).

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Rønneberg (Marshall Islands), reported on 'informal  informal' consultations on the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions of the  JWG report on its work during SB-11, as well as the draft COP-5  decision on the JWG's future work. A number of delegates agreed to  work on the basis of the Co-Chairs' proposals, while SAUDI ARABIA,  KUWAIT and the UAE said these drafts did not reflect their  concerns and sought to proceed on the basis of an earlier version.  Rønneberg said the JWG would proceed on a paragraph-by-paragraph  basis to consider the latest version of the Co-Chairs' draft.

On a paragraph in the draft conclusions outlining progress at SB- 10 and SB-11, AUSTRALIA and the US suggested replacing 'procedures  and mechanisms' relating to a compliance system with 'procedures  and processes,' in order to include consideration of Protocol  Articles 8 (expert review teams) and 16 (dispute settlement).  SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by SAMOA, the EU, the US and NEW ZEALAND,  proposed moving towards 'implementation of decision 8/CP4'  (procedures and mechanisms on compliance) rather than towards  'negotiations.' Rønneberg then proceeded to hold informal consultations. Delegates  agreed to two preambular paragraphs, but bracketed the paragraphs  relating to convening a workshop and using the Co-Chairs' paper as  a basis for the negotiation of a compliance system. A new  bracketed paragraph was introduced on convening a sufficient  number of sessions of the group prior to COP-6 to enable timely  completion of work. In considering the draft decision, delegates  agreed to the preambular paragraphs and debated, inter alia,  whether the JWG should 'complete its work' or 'make substantial  progress' at COP-6. The JWG will continue consultations.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### AIJ

Delegates continued deliberations on a revised text of the  recommended draft decision on AIJ under the pilot phase. Delegates  debated whether to, inter alia: conclude or continue the review  process; continue the review process and the AIJ pilot phase till  COP-6; or conclude the review process and continue the AIJ pilot  phase beyond the end of the decade. Delegates also bracketed a  paragraph requiring COP/MOP-1, in taking a final decision on the  modalities and procedures governing Article 6 (joint  implementation) and 12 (CDM), to determine the eligibility of AIJ  pilot phase projects to be incorporated under these mechanisms.  The draft decision, inter alia, concludes the review process and  continues the AIJ pilot phase beyond the end of the decade, and  requires Parties to provide proposals to improve the draft revised  uniform reporting format, and the Secretariat to prepare a draft  revision for SB-12. Parties also considered the Chair's draft  conclusions and entered references on the need for additional  incentives, such as the possibility of recognizing AIJ pilot phase  projects under Protocol Articles 6 and 12.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chairs Kjellén (Sweden) and Salamat (Iran)  introduced a revised draft decision on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9  (adverse effects). The group considered half of the draft text.  Divergence of views focused on: whether to 'establish' or  'continue' a process for the further implementation of FCCC  Articles 4.8 and 4.9; what the process was about; whether it  should be assessed by the Parties 'annually,' 'periodically,'  'on  a 'regular basis' or 'by COP-6 and subsequent COPs as  appropriate'; whether there should be one or two workshops in  2000; and what topics the workshop/s should address. A proposal  requesting Annex I Parties to report on initial actions undertaken  to implement FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 was discussed. Some  delegates considered that non-Annex I Parties should also be  requested to report on these actions.

### LULUCF

The contact group concluded its work on LULUCF-related  methodological issues. Issues resolved included, inter alia:  consideration of the IPCC Special Report by SBSTA-12; a  presentation of an 'in-depth report' by the IPCC at SBSTA-12; a  workshop on the Special Report between SBSTA-12 and COP-6;  consideration by SBSTA-12 of initial criteria and guiding  principles for the identification and selection of activities  under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional human-induced activities  relating to changes in emissions and removals); and a request for  the Parties to provide a list of additional activities that each  Party seeks to include under Protocol Article 3.4.

### MECHANISMS

On CDM project monitoring, MAURITANIA said monitoring  and reporting should not burden the host country. BOLIVIA  suggested that Parties monitor their own projects and 'learn by  doing.' NORWAY and AUSTRALIA said that project participants, the  host Party or a designated legal entity should monitor. The EU  said operational entities should perform certification and  verification, which is dependent on monitoring. Parties also  discussed conflicts of interest, random audits of projects,  project oversight by NGOs, and share of proceeds. On Article 6  project validation, JAPAN cautioned against creating unnecessary  bureaucracies. NEW ZEALAND noted that the host Party would have to  cancel some of its assigned amount. CANADA and the US noted that  Protocol Article 8 (review of information) provides a built-in  review. The EU questioned how additionality could be ensured if  Parties did not comply with Protocol Articles 5 and 7.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

In spite of successes by SBSTA and SBI in adopting a raft of  Chair's draft conclusions, many participants expressed a sense of  frustration at the lack of progress on critical issues.  Exasperated delegates remarked that as long as some countries are  invested in the status quo and 'deliberately stall' the process,  as happened on Monday in the JWG on compliance and in SBSTA on  emissions from bunker fuels, the emerging pattern of mounting  delays would make the vision of a ratified Protocol by Rio+10  unachievable.
