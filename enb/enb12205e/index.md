# CONTACT GROUPS

### REGISTRIES

This contact group, chaired by Murray Ward (New  Zealand), met on Saturday to discuss outstanding issues on  Protocol Article 7.4 (registries). Delegates discussed text  regarding the liability of Parties terminating transactions  under the registries. The group reached agreement in informal  consultations on the outstanding draft text, and draft  conclusions were forwarded to SBSTA.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

Chaired by Helen Plume (New Zealand) and  Festus Luboyera (South Africa), the contact group met Saturday  morning to agree draft SBSTA conclusions on guidelines for  reporting and review of Annex I inventories and on Articles 5, 7  and 8. They agreed on a draft COP/MOP-1 decision on the terms of  reference for lead reviewers, and addressed the section of the  draft guidelines on reporting under Article 7.1 and 7.2  (supplementary information), and on review of information on  assigned amounts and national registries under Article 8.  Informal discussions continued throughout the day.

    The group met Monday morning to consider and approve a new draft  of the pending parts of the guidelines under Article 7. The  modified sections referred to: information on emission reduction  units (ERUs), certified emissions reductions (CERs), assigned  amount units (AAUs) and removal units (RMUs), and national  registries. Pending sections of the guidelines under Article 8  were also considered, including: review of information on  assigned amounts pursuant to Article 7.3 (frequency of  submissions) and 7.4, ERUs, CERs, AAUs and RMUs; review of  national registries; and an expedited procedure for the review  of the reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms. The  EU, G-77/CHINA and NEW ZEALAND introduced minor changes. After  informal consultations, a formal contact group was convened and  the entire text was agreed.

### R&SO

Co-chaired by Sue Barrell (Australia) and S.K. Srivastav  (India), the contact group met in three sessions on Saturday to  discuss draft conclusions. CHINA, supported by JAPAN, INDIA,  MALAYSIA and BOTSWANA, highlighted the importance of building  endogenous capacity in developing countries. CANADA, with the EU  and US, opposed text inviting the SBI to provide guidance to the  financial mechanism in relation to decision 5/CP.5 (research and  systematic observation) and 5/CP.7 (adverse effects). Delegates  agreed on most remaining SBSTA conclusions in an evening session,  failing to agree, however, on a sub-paragraph proposed by the  Russian Federation referencing research priorities in support of  the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC. The EU, NORWAY,  SWITZERLAND, CHINA and AOSIS, opposed by the US, JAPAN and INDIA,  supported retaining the sub-paragraph, amended to refer to  exploring the scientific, technological and socioeconomic  aspects needed to achieve the UNFCCC's ultimate objective.

The group met Monday evening to consider revised draft  conclusions, including new paragraphs. These highlighted key  issues emerging from a special side event on research earlier in  the day, which consisted of an exchange between SBSTA, the IPCC  and several international research programmes. Following minor  revisions, Parties agreed on key issues in the dialogue on  research. On a new paragraph noting the need for a more  coordinated research approach to address cross-cutting issues,  INDIA, MALAYSIA and CHINA, opposed by the EU, RUSSIAN FEDERATION,  NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, proposed deleting reference to the  stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations. Discussions  continued into the night.

### LULUCF AND CDM

In a Saturday meeting of the contact group, Co- Chair Thelma Krug (Brazil) invited Parties to consider the  definition of additionality as set out in the Marrakesh Accords.  BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, supported the EU's principles on  additionality and said additionality should be considered on a  project-by-project basis. The EU stressed the importance of  'true' additionality. CANADA, with NORWAY, supported maintaining  the existing definition of additionality. On leakage, the EU  expressed concern about measuring leakage from activity  displacement. The G-77/CHINA said that leakage had both positive  and negative impacts. TUVALU and INDIA stressed the importance  of impact assessments.

    On Monday, Parties continued discussions on socioeconomic and  environmental impacts. SWITZERLAND highlighted biodiversity  concerns and promoted the inclusion of local stakeholders in  decision-making. NEW ZEALAND drew attention to displacement and  associated environmental risks from other types of CDM  activities. TUVALU proposed developing a checklist of  socioeconomic and environmental project criteria. Several  Parties stressed that host countries should define such criteria.  The EU said impact assessments should be considered in the  modalities. The CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK expressed concern about  sinks under the CDM. On uncertainties, CANADA, the EU and  URUGUAY supported the provisions laid out in the Marrakesh  Accords. TUVALU outlined three areas of uncertainty: measurement;  additionality; and risk. URUGUAY noted the need to separate  uncertainty from risk. INDIA noted the need to look beyond IPCC  good practice guidance on LULUCF.

On crediting and project lifetime, the EU, supported by a number  of Parties, urged for long-term crediting. COLOMBIA, PARAGUAY,  and CHILE said projects should be considered on a case-by-case  basis. TUVALU noted the problem of project crediting beyond the  first commitment period. BRAZIL urged for limiting crediting to  up to twenty years. CHINA indicated the crossover with non- permanence. COLOMBIA, with URUGUAY, BOLIVIA and CHILE, called  for small-scale sinks projects. The EU said it was premature to  consider simplified procedures for these projects. BRAZIL, CHINA,  MALAYSIA, and TUVALU stressed that the Marrakesh Accords catered  to small-scale energy projects. The group forwarded draft  conclusions to SBSTA.

### P&MS

Co-Chair Peer Stiansen (Norway) introduced a draft  decision on Saturday. Several Parties advocated using it as a  basis for discussion. SAUDI ARABIA said that the G-77/China had  not had enough time to consider the text fully. He said the G-77/China could not accept it as a basis for discussion because  it failed to address sufficiently issues relating to Protocol  Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms) and it opened the door to  new commitments for non-Annex I countries. Co-Chair Stiansen  said he would hold informal consultations.

On Monday morning, SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA, said that  there could be no progress on P&Ms until there was progress on  other issues. Co-Chair Stiansen said SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson  would hold informal consultations on a range of issues,  including P&Ms.

### ARTICLE 6

Co-Chairs Fatu Gaye (Gambia) and Jean-Pascal van  Ypersele (Belgium) convened this contact group Monday afternoon  to discuss the Co-Chairs' conclusions and the draft decision on  the work programme. The group bracketed all text related to  financial resources and requests to the SBI to provide  additional guidance to the financial mechanisms. Delegates could  not agree to language making reference to 'developing countries'  or 'non-Annex I Parties.' Co-Chair van Ypersele requested  Parties to continue meeting informally on the remaining elements  of the work programme.

### GUIDELINES FOR NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Jos√© Romero  (Switzerland) chaired this contact group. After informal  consultations, Parties discussed a working text on improved  guidelines for the preparation of non-Annex I national  communications on Saturday evening. Delegates removed a number  of brackets, but continued to disagree on text in the  introductory section.

On Monday, delegates met informally throughout the day to  continue deliberations on a revised text on the improved  guidelines. In the evening, Parties removed a number of brackets.  The group agreed to continue their work in informal  consultations on Tuesday.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

SBI Chair Estrada convened this contact  group on Monday evening. On the report of the GEF, the EU,  supported by NORWAY, SWITZERLAND and the US, requested text  highlighting the importance of the third GEF replenishment.  Parties could not agree on a process to provide additional  guidance to the financial mechanism for the operation of the  Special Climate Change Fund. Instead of entering negotiations on  the draft decision, NORWAY, SWITZERLAND, CANADA, JAPAN and the  EU, opposed by INDIA, BRAZIL, BARBADOS and CHINA, requested the  option to provide further submissions on the operational  priorities of the Fund. CHINA, supported by INDIA, underscored  the urgency of providing guidance in order to operationalize the  Fund.

Delegates discussed the Least Developed Country (LDC) Fund  without reaching agreement. CANADA noted that the chairs of the  LDCs and the LDC Expert Group (LEG) were not present. He  provided views on the draft decision to the GEF on the operation  of the LDC Fund. Supported by NORWAY, the EU and SWITZERLAND, he  stressed the importance of a clear focus on NAPAs and policy  level, rather than operational level, guidance to the GEF.

On the review of the financial mechanism, SWITZERLAND called for  this review to address the function and role of GEF, the  accountability and quality control of GEF resources and an  evaluation of enabling activities. NORWAY, supported by the US,  SWITZERLAND, NORWAY, JAPAN, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and the EU, and  opposed by INDIA, MALAYSIA, CHINA, called for the deletion of  text initiating a process to aggregate GEF funding requirements  for the UNFCCC, as well as a request to the Secretariat to  produce a paper for SBI-18 outlining procedures for joint  determination of necessary and available funding for UNFCCC  implementation.

The contact group will meet on Tuesday to continue their  deliberations.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The release of the much-anticipated first draft of the Delhi  Declaration hardly caused a stir. Several delegates were  disappointed that the draft did not call for any follow-up  action, and suggested that the focus of the negotiations would  soon shift away from the Declaration as a result. This  prediction came true in the early afternoon when COP President  Baalu summoned heads of delegation to meet informally to break  deadlock on a range of issues, reportedly including Article 2.3,  cleaner energy and the financial mechanism. Given the atmosphere  of mistrust apparent in Vigyan Bhawan, some delegates are  speculating on whether a fruitful outcome of COP-8 is possible.
