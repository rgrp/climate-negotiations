# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

### OPENING OF THE MEETING

COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 President Stéphane  Dion outlined progress on what he referred to as the 'three I's'  of 'implementation, improvement, and innovation.' On  implementation, he highlighted adoption of the Marrakesh Accords  and the compliance mechanism, while on improvement he cited  initiatives on adaptation and the CDM. On innovation, he said this  conference must demonstrate a strong commitment to Protocol  Article 3.9, but that action under Article 3.9 is only part of  the solution.

Louise Fréchette, UN Deputy Secretary-General, said all  industrialized countries need to intensify their efforts, thus  paving the way for action in the developing world. She observed  that the right mix of polices and incentives can galvanize green  technologies and change corporate and consumer habits.

Richard Kinley, UNFCCC Acting Executive Secretary, underscored the  need to increase financial support for developing countries,  particularly LDCs. He highlighted renewed momentum in the process  in 2005 and said this meeting was an opportunity to push forward.

Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, said developing countries  will suffer the most from climate change and urged developed  countries to meet their responsibilities. Stressing that the time  for complacency is over and inaction is not an option, he  underscored that climate change is a global challenge that needs  a global response.

### STATEMENTS FROM UN BODIES AND AGENCIES

The WORLD METEOROLOGICAL  ORGANIZATION highlighted the value of climate monitoring and  research that involves national meteorological services and  developing countries. UN DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS  recalled the 2005 World Summit's conclusions and emphasized the  need to integrate climate and development policies. Highlighting  the Millennium Development Goals and climate impacts on vulnerable  regions, UN ENVIRONMENT PROGRAMME urged faster and deeper cuts on  greenhouse gas emissions. INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION  ORGANIZATION lised technical standards, optimized controls,  shorter routings and emissions trading as options to reduce  aviation emissions. The INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE  updated Parties on the Fourth Assessment Report. The GLOBAL  ENVIRONMENT FACILITY explained the positive impacts of the  Resource Allocation Framework and noted ongoing negotiations on  GEF's fourth replenishment. The CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY  indicated that climate change is one of the drivers for  biodiversity loss and stressed linkages between the UNFCCC and  biodiversity-related agreements. The CONVENTION TO COMBAT  DESERTIFICATION urged strengthened collaboration between  conventions to support adaptation and combat desertification.

### COUNTRY STATEMENTS

Ministers and heads of delegation made  statements highlighting issues such as adaptation, extreme weather  events, CDM reform, funding and capacity building, commitments  under the Kyoto Protocol, technology transfer, the post-2012  process, and the adoption of the Marrakesh Accords.

In a video statement, French President Jacques Chirac stressed  that the Kyoto Protocol was a first step to halving global  emissions by 2050. Underscoring the need for a UN-based  multilateral response, he said bilateral or regional responses or  technology agreements alone were not sufficient.

###     Adaptation

AUSTRALIA, MEXICO and PANAMA stressed the importance  of adapting to the effects of climate change. MEXICO proposed  initiating a dialogue to enable developing countries to strengthen  their adaptation and mitigation efforts. JORDAN emphasized the  need to provide assistance for adaptation by developing countries.

###     Extreme Weather Events

Many speakers, including Jamaica, speaking  for the G-77/CHINA, as well as GUATEMALA and the DOMINICAN  REPUBLIC, noted the high toll from recent extreme weather events.  Mauritius, for AOSIS, noted the connection between increased sea  surface temperature and hurricane intensity, calling for further  work on adaptation, the CDM and the Mauritius Programme of Action.

###     Flexible Mechanisms

Several Parties highlighted the need to  improve or streamline the mechanisms. PANAMA noted the need to  reduce transaction costs, COLOMBIA called for a transparent and  efficient institutional framework, and MEXICO said the CDM should  enhance and complement national efforts. GUINEA BISSAU highlighted  the link between the CDM and poverty reduction, and the need for  technology transfer. MOROCCO supported projects on renewables.  BELGIUM said carbon markets will lead to necessary economic  changes, while UKRAINE emphasized the need to fine-tune the CDM  and JI.

###     Funding and Capacity Building

Many speakers, including GHANA,  JORDAN, MALI and GUINEA BISSAU, stressed the importance of  adequate funding and capacity building. Bangladesh, on behalf of  LDCs, called for compensation for damages caused by climate  change, supported adaptation efforts and NAPA implementation.  GHANA said it looks forward to operationalizing the Special  Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and Adaptation Fund. The G-77/CHINA  urged contributions to the SCCF. NEW ZEALAND stressed support for  the LDC Fund and needs of SIDS.

NAMIBIA noted the cumbersome role of the GEF and called for an  innovative approach to manage the Adaptation Fund. GUATEMALA  called for a financial mechanism to help maintain forest cover,  and DOMINICAN REPUBLIC highlighted GEF assistance for the  five-year programme of work on adaptation. SLOVENIA emphasized  the importance of longer term predictability to industry.

On capacity building, SUDAN called for efforts to ensure access to  opportunities and adaptive capabilities of people, and TOGO  stressed solidarity and equity, and the need for awareness raising  among young people. MACEDONIA highlighted the importance of  cooperation to maximize opportunities.

###     Kyoto Protocol Commitments

Several Annex I Parties emphasized  their commitment to meeting their targets. The UK, speaking for  the EU, ROMANIA and BULGARIA, noted an expected additional 1.3%  reduction by 2010 over the EU's 8% target. She urged the adoption  of a compliance mechanism and pledged to support the CDM, stating  that future work will include seeking a 15-30% reduction in  emissions by 2020 and supporting an open and innovative dialogue  with all countries. LITHUANIA said it will meet its Kyoto  obligations.

###     Mitigation

Many speakers outlined their mitigation activities.  LUXEMBOURG emphasized the importance of further mitigation,  including collectively halving global emissions by 2050.

###     Post-2012

IRELAND, MALTA, REPUBLIC OF KOREA and others supported  launching a process at this conference, and NORWAY supported more  ambitious commitments. The G-77/CHINA, MALAYSIA, BOLIVIA, SOUTH  AFRICA, NETHERLANDS, COLOMBIA, EC, PANAMA and MEXICO stressed the  principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Several  supported President Dion's latest proposal under the UNFCCC, while  the G-77/CHINA supported addressing future commitments under  Protocol Article 3.9. TANZANIA, NAMIBIA and others suggested  engaging developing countries on a voluntary basis, combined  with enforceable commitments by others. While noting the need  not to impose ideas on developing countries, GERMANY called for a  post-2012 regime built on the architecture of the Protocol.

SOUTH AFRICA proposed a two-track approach consisting of  bolstering the Protocol and supporting developing countries so  that they can do their fair share. COLOMBIA said a single,  comprehensive regime is needed. BOLIVIA said the value of avoided  deforestation should be recognized in the new commitment period.  DENMARK stressed the need for a clear timetable for deciding a  post-2012 framework. NEW ZEALAND supported a post-2012 regime that  effectively reduces emissions, is fair and equitable, cost  effective, and economically viable. The US said that all countries  must be included in combating climate change. She also highlighted  the value of bilateral and multilateral partnerships.

AUSTRALIA said President Dion's paper on future commitments  recognizes that some will not participate if the template is for  Kyoto-style national targets. He said all major emitters need to  take action and highlighted the importance of the Asia-Pacific  Partnership and the G8 process. ITALY stressed that countries  should undertake structured global action for de-carbonizing the  economy, including multilateral and bilateral mechanisms.

SLOVAKIA stressed decoupling  of emissions and economic growth. (Note: Complete webcast records  of these speeches will be available online at:  http://unfccc.streamlogics.com/unfccc/agenda.asp)

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### REPORT OF THE CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

After informal consultations,  delegates agreed to forward a Co-Chairs' draft decision to COP/MOP  1. The text covers efficient functioning of the CDM, including  responsiveness to the needs of Parties and stakeholders; and  presenting the Board's decisions along with appropriate  explanations. The draft decision defines the details of  retroactive crediting, requests the Board to call for public input  on additionality, and includes a differentiated share of proceeds  to cover the Board's administrative expenses. Parties also decided  to provide guidance on carbon dioxide capture and storage projects  at COP/MOP 2, and that policies or standards cannot be considered  CDM projects, but that projects under a programme of activities  can be registered as a single CDM project.

### COMPLIANCE

Following informal consultations, Co-Chair Mamadou  Honadia introduced a draft decision stating that Parties 'approve  and adopt' the compliance mechanism as contained in Decision  24/CP.7. The text adds that consideration of an amendment to the  Protocol will commence at SBI 24 with a view to making a decision  at COP/MOP 3. Parties raised no objections and decided to forward  it to COP/MOP 1 for adoption.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLE 3.9

Informal consultations continued on future  commitments under Protocol Article 3.9. Delegates agreed not to  discuss Article 9 (review of the Protocol) in this group until  Article 3.9 is dealt with. The discussion then focused on whether  to proceed with an ad hoc open-ended working group or workshops.

### FUTURE ACTIONS UNDER THE UNFCCC

Discussions continued in a  roundtable discussion on future actions under the Convention based  on a proposal by President Dion (FCCC/CP/2005/CRP.1). Further  consultations and a revised text are expected on Thursday morning.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Many negotiators breathed a sigh of relief on Wednesday as work on  compliance and the CDM was completed two days before the end of  the meeting. As one negotiator said, this now leaves time for  discussing 'the really important stuff' - a clear reference to  future actions. Opinions on this issue seem split among those  favoring an approach under Protocol Article 3.9 on future  commitments, those leaning towards an approach under the  Convention, and those who seem comfortable with a 'twin-track  approach.' Australia's apparent sympathy for Dion's initiative  also drew some comments from those who saw it as a contrasting  approach to that of the US. There was also increasing talk about  discussions under Protocol Article 9, which refers to a review of  the Protocol by COP/MOP 2.

As rumors swirled about progress - or lack thereof - in the  various informal discussions, several participants were heard  welcoming the involvement of former UNFCCC Executive Secretary  Michael Zammit Cutajar. 'The more sensible heads around now, the  better,' said one veteran of the process.
