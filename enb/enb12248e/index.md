abstract: "The 22nd session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) met from 9-11 November 2004, at the Ashok Hotel, in New  Delhi, India. Over 250 participants representing governments, UN  agencies, IPCC Technical Support Units, as well as inter- and  non-governmental organizations attended. During the meeting,  delegates discussed: the scope, content and process for an IPCC  Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) Synthesis Report; AR4 products;  outreach; the IPCC Programme and Budget for 2005-8; and election  procedures. Delegates also heard progress reports on: Working  Group contributions to the AR4; the Special Report on Safeguarding  the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System; the Special Report  on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage; the 2006 IPCC Guidelines  for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; and the work of the Task  Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis  (TGICA)."
---

In the cooperative spirit of the IPCC, delegates approved a process  for developing an AR4 Synthesis Report and a decision on the IPCC  programme and budget for 2005-8. Regarding the Synthesis Report,  delegates agreed to a 30-page report with a five- page Summary for  Policymakers to be approved by the IPCC in late October 2007. The  session also saw fruitful discussions on IPCC outreach, noting the  need to prepare communications strategies to ensure that special  reports and the AR4 reach the broadest possible audience.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme  (UNEP). The purpose of the IPCC is to assess the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding  the risks associated with human-induced climate change. The IPCC  does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor  climate-related data, but bases its assessments on published and  peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature. Its Secretariat  is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is staffed by both WMO and  UNEP.

Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of  comprehensive assessments, special reports and technical papers,  providing scientific information on climate change to the  international community, including policymakers and the general  public. This information has played an important role in the  negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC, which provides the overall  global policy framework for addressing climate change, was adopted  in 1992 and entered into force in 1994.

The current structure of the IPCC includes three working groups:Working Group I addresses the scientific aspects of the  climate system and climate change; Working Group II addresses the vulnerability of socioeconomic  and natural systems to climate change, negative and positive  consequences of climate change, and options for adapting to it;  and Working Group III addresses options for limiting greenhouse  gas (GHG) emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change.

The IPCC also has a Task Force on National GHG Inventories. The  Task Force on National GHG Inventories oversees the IPCC National  GHG Inventories Programme (NGGIP), which aims to develop and  refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the  calculation and reporting of national GHG emissions and removals,  and to encourage the use of this methodology by countries  participating in the IPCC and by UNFCCC signatories.

### KEY IPCC PRODUCTS

The IPCC completed its initial comprehensive  assessments of climate change in the First Assessment Report in  1990 and the Second Assessment Report in 1995. In 1994, it  prepared technical guidelines for assessing GHG inventories and  subsequently revised these in 1996. The UNFCCC's 1997 Kyoto  Protocol reaffirmed the use of the guidelines for preparing  national GHG inventories by Parties to the UNFCCC and, in the  future, by Parties to the Protocol.

The IPCC's Third Assessment Report (TAR) was completed by the  Panel in 2001. It addresses policy-relevant scientific, technical,  and socioeconomic dimensions of climate change. It concentrates on  findings since 1995 and pays attention to both regional and global  scales. The TAR is composed of a comprehensive assessment from the  three Working Groups, summaries for policymakers (SPM) and technical  summaries of each Working Group report, and a Synthesis Report. The  comprehensive assessments, Synthesis Report and SPMs were subject  to extensive peer review from experts and governments. The TAR  Synthesis Report is written in a non-technical style aimed at  policymakers. It addresses nine policy-relevant questions  identified by the IPCC based on submissions by governments.

### SEVENTEENTH SESSION

Discussions on the TAR concluded at IPCC-17  and IPCC-18. At IPCC-17, held from 4-6 April 2001, in Nairobi,  Kenya, participants accepted the actions of the three IPCC Working  Groups with regard to adopting their contributions to the TAR.  They considered progress on the TAR Synthesis Report, and discussed  in depth the future of the IPCC. Participants also approved the  preparation of a technical paper on the links between biological  diversity and climate change, and considered a proposal for a  special report on climate change and sustainable development.

### EIGHTEENTH SESSION

IPCC-18 was held from 24-29 September 2001, in  London, UK. Participants reviewed and adopted the TAR's SPMs and  Synthesis Report and made decisions to: retain the IPCC's three  Working Groups; maintain the Task Force on National GHG Inventories,  and keep the size of the IPCC Bureau at 30 members. They also  decided: to adopt the IPCC work programme and budget for 2002-4;  endorse a scoping paper for the Technical Paper on Climate Change  and Biological Diversity; and endorse, in principle, the  preparation of a technical paper on climate change and sustainable  development. In addition, they also accepted a work programme on  Good Practice Guidance on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry  (LULUCF), and authorized further work on developing definitions  for degradation and devegetation and the preparation of scoping  papers for work requested by the UNFCCC.

### NINETEENTH SESSION

Beginning at its nineteenth session, the IPCC  plenary embarked on work towards the next assessment report. At  IPCC-19, held from 17-20 April 2002, in Geneva, participants  decided, inter alia, on a draft workplan for developing  definitions for degradation of forest and devegetation of other  vegetation types, methodological options for estimating and  reporting emissions resulting from these activities, and elements  of the procedure for agreeing on NGGIP products. They also  decided: on the timing of the AR4; to hold a workshop on geological  and oceanic carbon separation, capture and storage; to draft a  scoping paper on climate change and water; and to hold an expert  meeting on climate change and development.

### TWENTIETH SESSION

IPCC-20 was held from 19-21 February 2003, in  Paris, France. Participants agreed on a work plan for two expert  scoping meetings on how to progress and structure AR4 and  discussed a framework and set of criteria for establishing  priorities for special reports, methodology reports and technical  papers for the period of the fourth assessment. They also decided  to hold a high-level scientific meeting to survey the processes  affecting carbon stocks and human influences upon them and to  produce a special report on safeguarding the ozone layer and the  global climate system.

### TWENTY-FIRST SESSION

At IPCC-21, held from 3-7 November 2003, in  Vienna, Austria, participants reviewed the outlines of the proposed  Working Group contributions to AR4 and the Chair's proposal for a  synthesis report of AR4. They agreed that a technical paper on  climate change and water should be completed in 2007, discussed  terms of reference for a document on the AR4 product set, and  reviewed the report of the IPCC expert meeting on processes  affecting terrestrial carbon stocks and human influences upon them.  The Panel approved the terms of reference for revising the Revised  1996 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories and agreed on a  revised mandate and name for the Task Group on Scenarios for  Climate and Impact Analysis (now TGICA).

# IPCC-22 REPORT

IPCC-22 opened on Tuesday, 9 November, with a lamp-lighting  ceremony. Thiru A. Raja, Indian Minister of Environment and Forests  noted the significance of ensuring that AR4 findings reach the  public at large, and the need for AR4 to highlight research in  developing countries.

Prodipto Ghosh, Secretary of the Indian Ministry of Environment  and Forests, highlighted the IPCC's service to the Parties to the  UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol and to the policymaking community in  general.

IPCC Chair R.K. Pachauri said the IPCC must respect the  perspectives of each member and that each member must respect the  perspectives of the Panel.

WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud said the IPCC's flexibility  should enable it to address issues beyond climate change and  emphasized the importance of the cross-cutting theme on water.

UNEP Executive Director Klaus Töpfer highlighted the significance  of the IPCC's work for related policy processes, and commended the  increased involvement by women and developing country authors in  AR4.

Halldór Thorgeirsson, Coordinator of the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body on  Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), highlighted the  importance placed by the UNFCCC on climate monitoring, the ongoing  revision of the GHG reporting guidelines, and good practice  guidance on land use, land-use change and forestry.

# APPROVAL OF THE IPCC-21 DRAFT REPORT

The report of IPCC-21 (IPCC-XXII/Doc.3) was approved with an  amendment by Switzerland clarifying an intervention on the  outcomes of the meeting on processes affecting terrestrial carbon  stocks and human influences upon them.

# PROGRESS REPORTS

### WORKING GROUP CONTRIBUTIONS TO AR4

Dahe Qin (China), Working  Group I Co-Chair, presented Working Group I's report (IPCC- XXII/Doc.9) and highlighted that Lead Authors and Review Editors  have been selected. He stated that a draft report will be  presented in May 2005 and that Working Group I has developed an  electronic system for easy access to documents and information.

Martin Parry (UK), Working Group II Co-Chair, introduced the  Working Group II report (IPCC-XXII/Doc.10). He said Working Group  II has selected authors, emphasizing the need for balanced  geographic representation and involving scientists new to the  IPCC. He outlined future steps and the incorporation of  cross-cutting themes, including water.

Referring to Working Group III's report (IPCC-XXXII/Doc.11),  Ogunlade Davidson (Sierra Leone), Working Group III Co-Chair, said  the group has attempted to increase regional representation on its  AR4 team and introduce new authors into the writing process. He  called attention to upcoming meetings on integrating adaptation  and mitigation and sustainable development, and on emissions  scenarios.

Iran requested that the timetables for the zero-order drafts of  the Working Groups should be adjusted to accelerate the completion  of each report. India urged that Working Group I's online journal  access be extended to other Working Groups and recommended that  details of gender and geographical balance should be reported  using the same categories for each Working Group.

Austria suggested that the plenary be briefed on the outcomes of  the Working Group III meetings on emissions scenarios, given the  high sensitivity and relevance of this information. Switzerland  stressed that politically sensitive questions should not be  addressed technically.

### SPECIAL REPORT ON SAFEGUARDING THE OZONE LAYER AND GLOBAL CLIMATE  SYSTEM

Bert Metz (the Netherlands), Working Group III Co-Chair,  introduced the report (IPCC-XXII/Doc.13/Rev.1), reviewed changes  in the report's scope and said it would be completed by April 2005.

### SPECIAL REPORT ON CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE

Working  Group III Co-Chair Metz said completion of this report has been  delayed until September 2005 to take full account of new literature  in the field (IPCC-XXII/Doc.14). He noted an experiment in the  review process being undertaken in which the expert review is  being conducted anonymously to improve objectivity when responding  to comments. Austria, opposed by the Russian Federation, supported  the experiment of using anonymous reviews. Chair Pachauri noted  that the outcomes of this experiment would be discussed by the  Panel in due course.

### 2006 IPCC GUIDELINES FOR NATIONAL GHG INVENTORIES

Thelma Krug  (Brazil), Co-Chair of the Task Force on National GHG Inventories,  reported that five meetings have been held covering all five  volumes of the guidelines (IPCC-XXII/Doc.12). She said  methodologies for estimating harvested wood products may be  included, and noted that the guidelines would aim to provide  further guidance on improving consistency of reporting of carbon  dioxide emissions. Noting the complexity and uncertainties  regarding the aerosol issues, Taka Hiraishi (Japan), Co-Chair of  the Task Force on National GHG Inventories, highlighted  alternative views on the timing of an expert meeting and noted  that a small expert meeting would be convened in 2005 (IPCC- XXII/Doc.16).

The Russian Federation said volcanic aerosols should be addressed.  Switzerland recommended continuing work on aerosols, but  questioned further discussing methodologies for issues not fully  resolved under the UNFCCC process, and advocated consultations  with SBSTA.

### TASK GROUP ON DATA AND SCENARIO SUPPORT FOR IMPACT AND CLIMATE  ANALYSIS

Renate Christ, IPCC Secretary, introduced the progress  report on the TGICA (IPCC-XXII/Doc.15), highlighting outcomes of  the first meeting under its new mandate, held in September 2004.  She noted that participants considered several issues, including  facilitating access to new General Circulation Model archives,  capacity building, and socioeconomic data. The Netherlands warned  against misinterpreting output derived from TGICA datasets as  'IPCC data.'

# SCOPE, CONTENT AND PROCESS FOR AN AR4 SYNTHESIS REPORT

Delegates discussed the AR4 Synthesis Report in the plenary on  Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday and in contact group meetings held  on Wednesday and Thursday. On Thursday afternoon, delegates  approved a process for developing a Synthesis Report. Throughout  the discussions, the issues of timing and content of the Synthesis  Report proved to be the greatest challenges for negotiations.

In Tuesday's plenary session, Chair Pachauri outlined the proposal  for an AR4 Synthesis Report (IPCC-XXII/Doc.5) and emphasized the  need for such a report, noting that its length should be limited  to about 30 pages, and explaining that the proposed writing team  would consist of four to six writers from each Working Group. IPCC  Secretary Christ introduced two possible timelines, noting that  both options take into account IPCC-XIX/Decision 6, requiring that  the Synthesis Report be finalized in the last quarter of 2007.  Martin Manning, Working Group I Technical Support Unit, expressed  concern regarding the proposed timeline for presenting an advance  copy of an AR4 Synthesis Report at UNFCCC COP-13 in November 2007,  and urged postponing a decision on timing.

Many delegates supported producing the AR4 Synthesis Report, and  stressed the need for agreement on its scope and timing. The US  pointed to potential problems related to drafting the Synthesis  Report prior to approval of the Working Group reports. Switzerland  said the Synthesis Report should present findings since the TAR.

Some delegates stressed that trying to finalize the Synthesis  Report in time for COP-13 might compromise the report's quality.  Working Group III Co-Chair Davidson stressed that quality is a  given parameter, and emphasized the importance of completing the  report by COP-13 for its findings to reach policymakers, with  Germany stating that the UNFCCC is the IPCC's 'main customer.' The  UK said no Synthesis Report by COP-13 would represent a 'retrograde  step' and make the IPCC 'irrelevant,' in the views of some.

On Wednesday morning, Martin Parry, Working Group II Co-Chair,  suggested that work on the Synthesis Report begin earlier, giving  writers an opportunity to brainstorm about key issues and monitor  their development in the Working Group SPMs.

The Netherlands and Mexico advocated overlap between the Working  Group and Synthesis Report writing processes to allow  re-examination by the Working Groups of any inconsistencies  identified by the Synthesis Report process. The US said work on  the Synthesis Report should not be initiated until after the  completion of expert reviews of the Working Group reports,  including the incorporation of comments into the reports.

Many delegates agreed that the Synthesis Report must be short and  concise. Cuba, Costa Rica, Peru and others emphasized that the  Synthesis Report must use inputs from the best experts with  balanced geographical representation, and said cross-cutting  themes should be integrated into the substance of the report. Some  delegates stressed that the Synthesis Report reflect a true  synthesis of the Working Group reports, as well as the special  reports.

China questioned the Synthesis Report's added value and stated  that if the Synthesis Report is prepared, it should provide a full  explanation of uncertainties to avoid misleading policymakers.

Malawi, Uganda, the Netherlands, Spain, Peru and others reiterated  the need to produce the Synthesis Report by UNFCCC COP-13 in 2007.  Slovenia favored producing the Synthesis Report by COP-13, but only  if this does not compromise quality. The US expressed concern that  time constraints would compromise the preparation of a high quality  report. Belgium said producing the Synthesis Report by COP-13 need  not compromise quality, and opposed postponing delivery.

Chair Pachauri established a contact group to further examine  content, length and timing of the Synthesis Report.

During the contact group's discussions, co-chaired by Geoff Love  (Australia) and Ismail Elgizouli (Sudan), delegates stressed that  listing topics should not constrain authors but should instead  provide guidance, with some stating that the debate was  preliminary and that content should not be finalized at this time.

A new timeline was proposed, and several participants expressed  concern that it was too tight, noting in particular that it calls  for approval by the IPCC one week prior to COP-13.

During Thursday morning's plenary session, Co-Chair Love reported  on progress made in the Contact Group, noting agreement that the  proposed content should be considered flexible and as guidance for  the authors. On content, participants debated proposed changes to  the topic heading on 'stabilization of GHG in the context of  sustainable development,' which had been changed to 'sustainable  development and mitigation in the long-term context.' Some  supported retaining the term 'stabilization,' while others favored  its deletion. The contact group reconvened to discuss this issue.

In the contact group, delegates discussed the proposed topic on  the long-term context. Some delegates supported making reference  to UNFCCC Article 2 (Objective), but after others opposed, the  reference was removed. Some insisted on referring to different  stabilization scenarios in a bullet point, but others opposed and  the issue was again put before Plenary.

In the Thursday afternoon plenary, Chair Pachauri introduced a new  version of the proposal for a Synthesis Report (IPCC- XXII/Doc.5/Rev.1). He explained the proposed Synthesis Report  would consist of two parts, a SPM of up to five pages of text and  a longer report of up to 30 pages of text. He noted that this  page-limit would include maps and figures but not indices.

Delegates then discussed content. New Zealand and the Netherlands  emphasized that the topic headings reflected agreed wording for  chapter titles, while the bullet points under each heading were  only meant as guidelines for authors, and asked that a sentence to  that effect be included in the proposal.

On the long-term perspective, China opposed referring to  stabilization scenarios in a bullet point. Chair Pachauri proposed  inserting the text 'different scenarios of GHG concentrations'  instead of 'stabilization,' which many delegates said they could  accept as a compromise. However, China, with Saudi Arabia, opposed  this formulation, and supported using only 'scenarios,' stating  that other scenarios are also covered. The US said the Report's  authors would address all scenarios and there was no need to be  specific. The Russian Federation insisted that 'stabilization' be  retained, stating that this is the main objective of the UNFCCC.  Chair Pachauri proposed that only 'scenarios' be referenced.  France, the Netherlands and others regretted that stabilization  was not mentioned, but agreed to the proposal. Canada regretted  the absence of the terms 'GHG' and 'stabilization' anywhere in the  section on content. Chair Pachauri said the Russian Federation's  opposition to deleting 'stabilization' would be noted in the  record. It was decided that the Chair's proposal to only reference  'scenarios' would be used in the final document.

On adaptation and mitigation options and responses, the US,  supported by New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands and Saudi  Arabia, suggested that authors should consider the same factors  for both adaptation and mitigation.

The US suggested adding a sixth topic in the content section that  identifies robust findings, key uncertainties and research needs.  Cuba, supported by Belgium, said cross-cutting issues should be  well integrated into the Synthesis Report. Contact Group Co-Chair  Love noted that there was agreement that cross-cutting themes  would be integrated in the Report.

Chair Pachauri stated that, in keeping with IPCC procedure, the  members of the Synthesis Report Writing Team would be selected by  the Chair in consultation with the Working Group Co-Chairs and  that the composition of the Writing Team would be approved by the  Bureau. New Zealand, supported by Italy and Belgium, recommended  that Working Group Report Review Editors could be considered for  the Synthesis Report writing team.

On the timing of the delivery of the Synthesis Report, Chair  Pachauri noted agreement among the Technical Support Units and the  Working Group Co-Chairs that the Synthesis Report could be  completed by COP-13 without a loss in quality.

Saudi Arabia said delivery prior to COP-13 may cause writers to be  pressured by political considerations and recommended postponing a  decision on this issue. Germany urged that the Synthesis Report be  completed by COP-13. He added that political considerations should  not influence the timing of the report. The US and Saudi Arabia  expressed hesitance that a high-quality report could be completed  by COP-13. The US also called for consideration of the authors'  needs. Belgium said the schedule appeared reasonable and Austria  noted that the Co-Chairs felt that the schedule would not  compromise the quality of the reports. IPCC Secretary Christ and  Chair Pachauri noted that the proposed timetable is similar to  that used for the TAR Synthesis Report.

Chair Pachauri said he would contact the UNFCCC Executive  Secretary to determine whether COP-13 could be postponed by one  month to address any lingering concerns regarding the Synthesis  Report. UNFCCC SBSTA Coordinator Halldór Thorgeirsson said he  would also inform the UNFCCC Executive Secretary, but noted that  postponement would have to be decided by the Parties.

###     Final Document

The final document has a background paragraph, and  sections on scope, content and process. It states that the proposed  Synthesis Report would consist of an SPM of up to five pages of  text, and a longer report of up to 30 pages of text, including maps  and figures.

The content section contains topic headings and a list of bullets  that are intended as guidance to the authors, and states that  cross-cutting themes will be addressed throughout the report, and  that topics will highlight new finding since the TAR, and  uncertainties. The topics address:observed changes in climate and its effects; causes of change; climate change and its impacts in the near and long term  under different scenarios; adaptation and mitigation options and responses, the inter- relationship with sustainable development, at global and regional  levels; the long-term perspective: scientific and socioeconomic  aspects relevant to adaptation and mitigation, consistent with the  objectives and provisions of the convention and in the context of  sustainable development; and robust findings and key uncertainties.

The document also lays out the process regarding the writing team,  time schedule, and management of the Synthesis Report. It states  that the Core Writing Team would consist of four to six members  from the author teams for each Working Group report and should be  chosen to ensure that the team has the scientific and technical  expertise required to cover a range of views and has geographical  representation. The proposal provides for selection of the writing  team in late 2005, with writing to begin in the second half of  2006 after the second order drafts of all three Working Group  reports have been set out for government and expert review.  Adoption and approval of the Synthesis Report is foreseen from 22- 26 October 2007, to allow delivery of an unedited version of the  Synthesis Report to UNFCCC COP-13. The section on management of  the Synthesis Report lays out expertise and technical support  required, and related costs that would be incurred.

# AR4 PRODUCTS

In plenary on Wednesday, IPCC Secretary Christ introduced a  document on AR4 Products (IPCC.XXII/Doc.6), noting that it  reflected points raised by a contact group convened at the 31st  Session of the IPCC Bureau in April 2004.

New Zealand stressed the importance of providing regionally  relevant information and datasets, and Saudi Arabia called for  addressing regional issues in the Working Group reports. Working  Group II Co-Chair Parry described two possible approaches for  indexing regional information. He explained that the first is  based on a content analysis of the final text, while the second  involves the authors making note of the topic and region concerned  by each reference in the report. For the latter option, he noted  the need to first discuss such an approach with the authors. Not  opposing the use of regional centers to disseminate information,  Switzerland stressed the need for integrity in the process of  selecting information to be disseminated. Australia said  comprehensive indexing and cross-referencing of products enhances  the utility of the Working Group reports, and underlined the value  of establishing an electronic search facility. Canada stressed the  need to explore the feasibility of introducing an index, noting  that the IPCC is not the body to discuss how it is done. Jean  Palutikof, Working Group II Technical Support Unit, stated that  the AR4 process is too advanced to ask Lead Authors to index their  work, since their terms of reference have already been agreed.  Germany stressed the urgency of indexing regional information.

On making models, datasets, scenarios and visualization tools  available, the Netherlands questioned labeling datasets or models  as 'IPCC approved,' but acknowledged the usefulness of making  available supporting materials for graphs, referring to similar  practices in science journals. Denmark, with Belgium, called for  easy access to graphs and tables in the final report, and asked  that the translation of the text in the figures be facilitated.  Citing the need for transparency and accountability, Belgium and  Denmark called for making the simple model used to produce those  graphics available with its source code and parameters. No  decision was presented on this issue.

# OUTREACH

This item was discussed in a Task Group on Outreach on Tuesday and  Thursday, and in plenary on Wednesday and Thursday.

In the Task Group meeting on Tuesday, Outreach Task Group Co-Chair  John Stone (Canada) asked the group to consider fact sheets  prepared by the Secretariat introducing the IPCC, its history,  membership, procedures, and activities. Regarding fact sheets  proposed at IPCC-21 on climate change and small island States,  delegates expressed the need for a different preparation process  for these particular sheets. Some participants proposed that these  be treated as short technical papers, as their preparation might  require interpretation of IPCC-approved reports.

In plenary on Wednesday, IPCC Secretary Christ introduced the  document on outreach (IPCC-XXII/Doc.7), highlighting sections on  interaction with the media and on the distribution of IPCC  publications. Task Group Co-Chair Stone reported on progress in  the Task Group, explaining that discussions had focused on the  fact sheets, with broad agreement that these should be translated  into the six UN languages and formally sent to governments. He  noted that some participants proposed that fact sheets should  include a statement making it clear that the materials they  contain are derived from previously approved IPCC documents.

Several countries stressed the urgent need for developing an  outreach strategy. The Netherlands, with the US, stressed the  importance of reviewing fact sheets. On producing a list of  speakers, Austria and Belgium said experts must be clear about the  capacity in which they are speaking. Stressing the need for  improved outreach in his region, Iran, supported by Afghanistan,  proposed that the IPCC hold workshops focusing on Asia and the  Middle East. Switzerland and Belgium recommended exploring  synergies with activities taken under UNFCCC Article 6 (education,  training and public awareness). Working Group III Co-Chair Bert  Metz and Germany warned against postponing a decision on outreach,  with Metz noting that two upcoming Special Reports will be  completed prior to IPCC-24.

In the Task Group on Thursday, participants discussed the  preparation of a communications strategy, agreeing to prioritize a  strategy for the 2005 release of the Special Reports on  Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System and on  Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage. Noting resource constraints,  they identified the preparation of a longer-term communications  strategy as a second priority. Stressing that outreach for the  Special Reports should be carried out in collaboration with  relevant Technical Support Units and the Task Group Co-Chairs,  participants emphasized the need to:post the translation of the SPMs on the IPCC website within a  month of their release; prepare press releases; organize media and other briefings; prepare a CD-ROM and a set of slides with key graphs; and provide a mechanism for feedback from users.

In plenary on Thursday, Task Group Co-Chair Stone reported on  progress. Noting that one of the Special Reports is due for  release at IPCC-23, he explained that the Bureau would be  consulted on the communications strategy, and underlined a  consensus that the Secretariat should proceed without delay to  hire the appropriate expertise. No decision was presented for  adoption.

# IPCC PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2005-8

The issue of the IPCC Secretariat's programme and budget for  2005-8 was taken up in plenary on Tuesday and Thursday, and in  contact group sessions on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.

In plenary on Tuesday, IPCC Secretary Christ presented a document  containing the proposed programme and budget for 2005-8 (IPCC- XXII/Doc.4/Rev.1). Chair Pachauri asked Marc Gillet (France) and  Zhenlin Chen (China) to co-chair a contact group of the Financial  Task Team to discuss the proposed programme and budget for 2005-8.  On Thursday, the plenary adopted a decision on the programme and  budget for 2005-8.

In the contact group meetings, the Task Team discussed advantages  and disadvantages of a proposal to level the annual expenditure  across the four years, requesting details on the implications of  such a measure, given the IPCC's multi-year work programme. Some  participants stressed that contributions necessary for publication  of AR4 should be collected prior to 2007, given the significant  cost of publication. They also addressed various options for the  length and cost of IPCC-23 in 2005. Participants suggested  documenting projections of expenditures and contributions.

Participants considered the possibility of applying unused funds  that are budgeted for specific items of the programme to other  items that risk over-expenditure. Similarly, the group addressed  options for enhancing the flexibility of the budget to apply  funding for unused journeys to one meeting to support additional  participants' travel to other meetings.

Participants also debated at length the feasibility of sponsoring  Lead Authors' participation in non-IPCC meetings, and discussed  provisions on co-sponsoring workshops.

Supported by others, one participant proposed a meeting following  the expert review process where authors and reviewers could  discuss diverging opinions in order to improve transparency.

Task Team participants raised the issue of the Secretariat hiring  additional staff for outreach purposes, asking whether this was  included in the budget.

In its final two contact group meetings on Wednesday and Thursday,  Task Team participants examined the draft decision on the  Secretariat's programme and budget for 2005-8, discussing how and  whether to reflect the annual carry-over amount of CHF 4 million,  and the implications that this reference may have on contributions  by governments. They agreed to refer to the carry-over, without  referring to any desire to maintain it beyond 2008. Some supported  defining clearly the rationale for the carry-over.

In plenary on Thursday, Co-Chair Gillet summarized the contact  group's discussions and presented the draft decision. Recalling  the decision at IPCC-18, Belgium, supported by Canada, stressed  the urgency of hiring an outreach specialist for the IPCC, and  stressed that this salary should be reflected in the budget for  2005. The US noted that the IPCC-18 decision does not specify a  full-time position, which was confirmed by the Secretariat, who  noted that the decision on hiring staff was dependent upon  agreement on an outreach strategy.

Regarding options for increasing the budget, Tunisia pointed to  revenues from the sale of IPCC products, and Belgium suggested  that the IPCC should receive a portion of the revenues. IPCC  Secretary Christ clarified that in exchange for receiving sales  revenues, the publisher offers a cheaper bulk ordering price.

Responding to a question from Australia on whether the AR4  Synthesis Report is provided for in the budget, IPCC Secretary  Christ confirmed that this was the case, but noted that the budget  could be reconsidered in light of a decision on the Synthesis  Report. India suggested considering the possibility of producing  the Working Group reports in countries where production costs are  lower. The IPCC then adopted the decision.

###     Final Decision

In the decision (IPCC-XXII/Doc.17), the Panel  adopts the revised budget for 2005 and takes note of the  forecasted budget for 2006 and of the indicative budgets for 2007  and 2008. The Panel encourages the Working Group Bureaus, the Task  Force Bureau and the Co-Chair of the TGICA to continue providing  the Secretariat with early notice of planned meetings and other  activities proposed to be funded by the IPCC Trust Fund. It also  recommends that the Secretariat continue regularly updating and  presenting the annual rate of voluntary cash contributions to the  IPCC Trust Fund, and communicating this information to governments  and other contributors when seeking voluntary contributions to the  Trust Fund.

The Panel also expresses gratitude to governments, the WMO, UNEP,  UNFCCC and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) for their  contributions and thanks the IPCC Chair and Secretary for their  efforts to widen the basis of financial contributors to the IPCC.  It invites governments to contribute to the IPCC Trust Fund and  requests the Chair to formally write to governments and other  possible contributors requesting such contributions.

# ELECTION PROCEDURES

IPCC Secretary Christ introduced, and delegates discussed, this  issue in plenary on Thursday morning (IPCC-XXII/Doc.8). Open-ended  Task Group on Election Procedures Co-Chair David Warrilow (UK)  highlighted the need for discussions on the replacement of Bureau  members, the nominations committee, size of the Bureau, and using  UNFCCC rules as a model.

Switzerland noted issues requiring clarification, including:  implications of using provisions taken from UNFCCC rules of  procedure that have not yet been agreed by that body; consistency  among provisions; and nomination procedures. The US and Belgium  underlined the need for a definition of the assessment cycle or  for an end date for each Bureau.

The Russian Federation and Election Procedures Group Co-Chair  Richard Odingo (Kenya) recommended that the WMO rules should be  used as a model and, with Austria and Switzerland, urged fair  regional representation on the Bureau.

The US and others noted the need for further discussions on the  nomination committee and Co-Chair Odingo supported its use.

Belgium, opposed by Co-Chair Odingo, said the current size of the  Bureau is effective. Co-Chair Odingo said the Chair should determine  its size. Opposed by the Russian Federation, Belgium suggested that  Bureau and Chair elections should be staggered. The US suggested  that further discussions were needed. Belgium and Germany made  separate proposals for the replacement of Bureau members in midstream.

The Panel agreed to ask members to forward comments to the Co-Chairs  of the Election Procedures Group and to the Secretariat by 15 January  2005, and agreed that the contact group would prepare a revised draft  for consideration at IPCC-24.

# CLOSING PLENARY

IPCC Secretary Christ said IPCC-23 would be held on 8 April 2005,  in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Chair Pachauri thanked India for hosting  the session, and gavelled the meeting to a close at 6:26 pm.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF IPCC-22 RECIPE FOR AN ASSESSMENT REPORT

At its 22nd session, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) met to continue the preparation, initiated in 2002, of its  Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) on climate change, its causes,  possible impacts and related response measures. As a result of its  previous assessments, the IPCC has come to be known as the most  esteemed, credible and comprehensive mechanism for the review of  the state of knowledge on climate change. While hundreds of  scientists are brought together to author the reports, governments  are also included in the review process, offering a bridge between  science and policy concerns. The following analysis highlights the  successes of IPCC's 22nd session, while reflecting on implications  for the AR4 in the broader context of global efforts to address  climate change.

# MEASURE OUT THE INGREDIENTS

Since its inception, the IPCC has played an important role in the  formulation of policy to address climate change. This is  particularly reflected by the catalytic impact of the IPCC's First  Assessment Report in 1990 in generating the impetus leading to the  adoption of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  in 1992. Hence, the relationship between the IPCC and the UNFCCC  has always been close, with the UNFCCC relying heavily the IPCC's  outputs and the IPCC looking the UNFCCC for mandates on special  reports. The resulting balance between scientific and political  agendas has led to suggestions that this forum might be more  efficient if it involved only scientists striving for the highest  standard of science, or only policymakers familiar with the UNFCCC  process, which would ensure that participants are speaking the  same 'language.' However, many point to the participation of both  scientists and policymakers as a key characteristic of the IPCC,  and extol the inclusive and interactive nature of the  intergovernmental process.

# ADD THE SPICES

Recent efforts aimed at expanding the gender and geographic  diversity of contributors and maintaining an open and transparent  process have ensured that more governments preserve a sense of  ownership of the final products, while upholding the scientific  integrity of the reports. Now in its 17th year, the IPCC continues  to garner credibility from policymakers for its policy-relevant  reports, while its extensive review process continues to enlist  the trust and commitment of the scientific community. Indeed, the  ever-growing breadth of financial contributions, as demonstrated  in the programme and budget adopted at this session, shows the  strong dedication that countries have to the process.

Nevertheless, IPCC-22 reflected the potentially delicate nature of  such a science/policy mixture. In particular, the issue of the AR4  Synthesis Report demonstrated that even while endeavoring to  achieve the goal of policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive  outputs, the Panel must make a continuous effort to avoid  accommodating policy agendas. This Report is widely acknowledged  to be the most important IPCC document for the UNFCCC process, and  hence its contents are subject to greater pressures to reflect  political interests.

# MARINATE AND COOK

Coming into IPCC-22, there was widespread recognition that the  Synthesis Report would be the main bone of contention for a  variety of reasons. Indeed, even its preparation was in doubt, and  formal and informal discussions on the Report's scope, length,  content, and timing kept corridors and meeting rooms buzzing  throughout IPCC-22, including through early morning, lunch and  evening sessions. On timing, much of the deliberations centered on  a goal of delivering the Report before UNFCCC COP-13, scheduled  for November 2007. Many warned against an accelerated Synthesis  Report process that may prioritize the political process over  scientific quality. Others recalled that the UNFCCC is the IPCC's  'main customer,' and feared that if a Synthesis Report were not  available, policymakers may rely on alternative interpretations of  the three Working Groups' reports, thus not only weakening the  significance of the IPCC's work, but also decoupling it from the  UNFCCC process. As one participant put it, 'COP-13 is late; COP-14  is too late.' In the end, fears that a Synthesis Report would be evaded were  alleviated, as participants agreed to a compromise proposal for a  30-page report with a five-page Summary for Policymakers to be  approved by the IPCC in late October 2007. Through close  consultations with Co-Chairs of the Working Groups and heads of  the Technical Support Units, IPCC Chair R.K. Pachauri was able to  instill considerable confidence that quality would not be  sacrificed for the sake of expediency.

# ... AND SERVE!

The dissemination of IPCC products also tests the Panel's ability  to retain its trademark integrity, through its struggles to convey  the findings of the IPCC's outcome documents without distorting  their content. As a result, there was a strong commitment to  developing an outreach strategy and the Outreach Task Group's  discussions were fruitful in identifying priorities for  disseminating the special reports on Ozone and Climate Change and  on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, which are due for completion  in 2005. Participants saw this as an opportunity to gather  experience and build a long-term communications strategy, which  would be in place to ensure that the AR4 reaches the broadest  possible audience. While concerns were expressed regarding the  costs of such activities, the long-standing interest in this  matter is sure to generate the necessary political will for  overcoming these financial constraints.

The process of creating an 'international dish' out of the  available ingredients proved successful at IPCC-22. With firm  deadlines now in place for the completion of the three Working  Group reports and the Synthesis Report, the AR4 process is well on  its way to providing the international community with another  serving of reviews of climate change science.
