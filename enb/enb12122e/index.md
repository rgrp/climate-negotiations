# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

COP-5 President Jan Szyszko (Poland) offered his personal  impressions of the high-level segment. He stated that the  discussions had been frank and open, and said he sensed a strong  willingness to move the process forward. Highlighting some of the  views raised in the discussions, he noted that Annex I and non- Annex I Parties had emphasized their domestic actions and  cooperation with others Parties in terms of meeting the FCCC's  objectives. He indicated that participants were concerned about  the adverse effects of climate change and noted that recent  extreme weather events had generated a sense of urgency. He  observed that some participants were seriously concerned about the  impact of response measures. On the negotiating process, he said a  new spirit marked by political commitment was evident. He noted  unanimity on the need to intensify negotiations in the lead-up to  COP-6, and said there was broad support for the entry into force  of the Protocol at the soonest possible time. Regarding options  for the intensification of the process, he drew attention to a  variety of proposals, including calls for a facilitator, a  Committee of the Whole, or both, while noting that other  participants considered that the existing structures were  sufficient to undertake the process. He concluded by saying he  would consult extensively on the best way to proceed and make  progress.

# PLENARY

On the review of the implementation of commitments and other FCCC  provisions, and on preparations for COP/MOP-1, President Szyszko  proposed a decision for adoption by COP-5 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.14). He  said his proposal expressed the will of the COP to engage in  intensified negotiation to implement the Buenos Aires Plan of  Action (BAPA) and added that in implementing the decision he would  take into account all the views expressed. The decision was  adopted. SAUDI ARABIA said he could not accept negotiations taking  place outside the FCCC bodies, and opposed the appointment of  facilitators.

President Szyszko reported that he was still conducting  consultations on proposals from Turkey and Kazakhstan to amend the  lists in Annexes I and II of the FCCC.

The Chairs of SBSTA and SBI reported on their work, expressed  satisfaction in having dealt with all the matters on their agenda  and listed the decisions they had arrived at. The COP took note of  their reports.

On the date and venue of COP-6 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.9), the COP decided  to accept the invitation of the Netherlands to host the COP. The  NETHERLANDS noted the high expectations set for COP-6 and said  that its success will lie in producing a package addressing the  concerns of all Parties.

The COP also adopted the calendar of meetings (FCCC/CP/1999/L.12)  for 2000 - 2003. On the Multilateral Consultative Committee,  Neroni Slade (Samoa) reported on informal consultations he had  conducted. He said this issue needed to be seen in the broader  context of the consideration and resolution of other issues. He  stated that COP-5 was not the appropriate moment to advance the  outstanding issues relating to FCCC Article 13 (resolution of  questions regarding implementation).  Delegates agreed to defer  consideration of the matter to COP-6.

On the Rules of Procedure, President Szyszko reported that,  despite informal consultations, there was no consensus on the  rules. Delegates agreed to defer the issue to COP-6.

The COP adopted the conclusions reached by SBSTA on the impact of  single project emissions in the commitment period  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.17) that call for further consideration of the  issue with a view to adopting a decision by COP-6.

On national systems, adjustments and guidelines, the COP endorsed  the SBSTA conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.14) and encouraged SBSTA  to complete by COP-6 its work on guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communication) and 8 (review of  information).

On the development and transfer of technologies, the COP adopted  the draft decision (FCCC/CP/1999/L.5) that extends the  consultative process through to COP-6, when a decision on a  framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the  implementation of technology transfer under the FCCC will be  taken.

Delegates adopted a draft decision approving the programme budget  for the biennium 2000 - 2001 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.7). They also adopted  the draft decision on income and budget performance in the  biennium 1998 - 1999 (FCCC/CP/1999/L.8), which also contains  arrangements for administrative support.

On the institutional linkage of the FCCC Secretariat to the UN  (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.11), President Szyszko recalled that a decision  was adopted earlier that defers consideration of international  juridical personality of the Secretariat to 2001, in conjunction  with the review of the institutional linkage of the FCCC  Secretariat to the UN which will be completed by 31 December of  that year.

On Annex I communications, the COP adopted a draft decision on  Part I of the FCCC reporting guidelines on annual inventories  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.2), together with an addendum containing the  guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/6/Add.1). It also adopted a draft  decision on Part II of the guidelines (FCCC/CP/1999/L.3) and the  addendum containing the guidelines (FCCC/CP/1999/L.3/Add.1). COP-5  then adopted the draft decision on guidelines for the technical  review of GHG inventories from Annex I Parties  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.11). The guidelines, attached as an addendum  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.11/Add.1), were adopted after CHINA amended the  text to state that the purpose of the technical review is to  assist 'Annex I Parties' instead of 'all Parties' in gaining  experience relevant to the preparation of guidelines related to  Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.

COP-5 adopted a draft decision on the first compilation and  synthesis of initial communications from non-Annex I Parties  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.10), as well as a draft decision on other matters  related to non-Annex I communications  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.10/Add.1/Rev.1). The COP noted with appreciation  the Report of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) contained in  the draft report of SBI-11 (FCCC/SBI/1999/L.11).

The COP adopted draft decisions on capacity building for  developing countries (FCCC/CP/1999/L.19) and economies in  transition (FCCC/CP/1999/L.20). The decisions, inter alia, provide  for financial and technical support for capacity building and  assessment of existing capacity-building activities.

The COP adopted a draft decision on FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9 and  Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects) (FCCC/CP/1999/L.22) that,  inter alia: continues the process of implementation of FCCC  Articles 4.8 and 4.9; requires the process to identify actions  necessary to meet the specific needs of developing and least  developed countries; and decides to organize a workshop on the  consideration of initial actions.

On activities implemented jointly (AIJ) under the pilot phase  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.13), the COP decided to conclude the review  process and extend the AIJ pilot phase beyond the end of the  present decade.

The COP adopted the draft decision on matters relating to LULUCF  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.16). The decision endorses a work programme and  elements of a decision-making framework to address LULUCF with a  view to COP-6 recommending that COP/MOP-1 adopt draft decisions on  Protocol Articles 3.3 (net changes in emissions and removals) and  3.4 ( additional human-induced activities relating to changes in  emissions and removals).

On mechanisms, the COP adopted the draft decision on the work  programme on mechanisms (FCCC/CP/1999/L.15). The decision requests  the SBI and SBSTA Chairs to revise their Synthesis of Parties'  proposals on mechanisms and consolidate a text to be used as a  basis for further negotiation. On principles, modalities, rules  and guidelines, the draft decision requests the SBI and SBSTA  Chairs to convene inter-sessional meetings and workshops to assist  in undertaking preparatory work for COP-6. Contact group Chair  Chow (Malaysia) suggested that a working paper prepared by him and  with no official status could assist Parties in making further  proposals. He said he would send an electronic version of this  working paper to interested delegates, and provided his e-mail  address: chow@kgc.gov.my.

On procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance under the  Protocol, the COP took note of the report of the Joint Working  Group on compliance (JWG) (FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.7) and adopted a draft  decision (FCCC/CP/1999/L.21) requesting the JWG to continue its  work beyond COP-5 and make substantial progress toward completing  its work and fulfilling its mandate by COP-6.

Delegates then considered other matters referred to the COP by SB- 11. On research and systematic observation, the COP adopted a  draft decision (FCCC/CP/1999/L.4) aimed at improving global  climate observation systems. The draft decision also adopts the  FCCC reporting guidelines on global climate observing systems  (FCCC/CP/1999/L.4/Add.1).

The COP adopted a draft decision on the relationship between  efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone layer and efforts to  safeguard the global climate system (FCCC/CP/1999/L.6). The  decision, inter alia: invites each Party to give consideration to  information on available and potential ways and means of limiting  emissions of hydrofluorocarbons and perfluorocarbons and  associated emissions in CO2 equivalent; and requests the IPCC to  take into account this information in the elaboration of its Third  Assessment Report.

COP-5 took note of the draft conclusions on the scientific and  methodological aspects of the proposal by Brazil  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.13/Rev.1), which states that SBSTA, inter alia,  takes note of a revised version of the proposal by Brazil and  decides to consider any new information on this issue at  subsequent sessions, as appropriate. A draft decision on  cooperation with the IPCC was also adopted (FCCC/CP/1999/L.18), as  was a draft decision on emissions based on fuel sold to ships and  aircraft engaged in international transport  (FCCC/SBSTA/1999/L.17).

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Participants were expressing a sense of pleasant surprise at the  prospect of an early finish to COP-5. Many observers felt that the  frank exchange of views in the high-level segment had acted as a  catalyst by providing the political impetus needed to complete  negotiations and ignite intensified efforts in the lead-up to COP- 6. However, while many felt satisfied with technical progress made  in Bonn, others were concerned that discussions on substantive and  complex issues lagged behind and would require intensified  intersessional work if COP-6 was to be a success and the Protocol  was to come into force in time for Rio+10 in 2002.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY
