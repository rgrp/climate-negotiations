# OPENING PLENARY

COP-6 President Jan Pronk opened the resumed COP-6, noting that  participants are meeting to resolve outstanding issues from the  first part of COP-6 in The Hague in November 2000. He said the  negotiations would be based on bracketed texts brought forward  from The Hague. In addition, an unbracketed consolidated  negotiating text he had developed would serve as a tool to assist  negotiators. President Pronk drew attention to the many  consultations on procedure and substance since November 2000. He  said negotiations at the diplomatic level would be held from  Monday until Thursday morning, 19 July. High-level ministerial  discussions would begin Thursday evening, following a ceremonial  session of the COP Plenary. He expressed the hope that  negotiations over the next three days would resolve as many issues  as possible, and would leave only the most difficult issues for  ministers and senior officials.

On the organization of work, delegates agreed to establish four  negotiating groups on the following issues: finance, technology  transfer, adaptation, capacity building, and adverse effects,  chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) and Andrej Kranjc  (Slovenia); mechanisms, chaired by Raul Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina)  and Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia); land use, land-use change and  forestry (LULUCF), chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and Philip  Gwage (Uganda); and compliance, chaired by Tuiloma Neroni Slade  (Samoa) and Harald Dovland. President Pronk noted that additional  'resource people' - delegates experienced on these specific  questions - would assist the chairs. He indicated that a further  negotiating group may be established later on UNFCCC Articles 5  (methodological issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8  (review of information).

IRAN, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, drew attention to developments  since COP-6 Part I, including the US administration's  announcement. He stressed that delegates are in Bonn to complete  their unfinished work, and highlighted the need to clearly  differentiate between UNFCCC and Protocol issues under  negotiation.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### LULUCF

Co-Chair Dovland encouraged the LULUCF negotiating group  to exchange views on Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities).  BRAZIL, for the G-77/CHINA, said President Pronk's consolidated  negotiating text represented a reconsideration of Annex I Party  commitments, and highlighted concerns that the definition of  additional activities under Article 3.4 creates a precedent for  unlimited enlargement of the Protocol's scope in the future. She  said emissions by sources and removal by sinks due to LULUCF  activities should be treated symmetrically, and that windfall  effects should be factored out.

Many delegates underscored the scale of credits available for  sinks as a key issue for the first commitment period. AUSTRALIA  and CANADA supported the Pronk text as a good starting point in  this regard, stressing that LULUCF is fundamental for countries  considering ratification. CANADA said it is working on a more  country-specific proposal for moving forward on this issue. The EU  highlighted scale as a problem but, with NORWAY and SWITZERLAND  for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, stressed that the Pronk  proposal represents a sound basis for negotiation.

TUVALU opposed including Protocol Article 3.4 activities during  the first commitment period, as proposed in the Pronk text,  stressing that it represents a renegotiation of the Kyoto targets  and undermines the integrity of the Protocol. THAILAND said  Article 3.4 activities should not be included until there is more  scientific certainty. BRAZIL, supported by CHINA, NAURU and INDIA,  stressed concerns with regard to the integrity of the Protocol if  too liberal an interpretation is applied to activities under  Article 3.4. On definitions, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA said  'forest management' warrants further consideration.

Reflecting on Parties' statements, Co-Chair Dovland said it was  apparent that significant differences remained, and that it was  difficult to detect any emerging consensus. He requested  suggestions on how to move discussions forward. Several speakers  supported breaking into a smaller group/groups, if necessary. The  EU said it was working on a proposal it hoped would improve the  prospects for compromise. Co-Chair Dovland said the negotiating  group would start its meeting on Tuesday by hearing new proposals  for Article 3.4. It may also hold a small group meeting to explore  options in greater depth.

### FINANCIAL ISSUES

The negotiating group on financial issues,  including capacity building, technology transfer, adaptation,  UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14  (adverse effects), met in the afternoon to consider the  negotiating text on capacity building and the text on guidance to  the financial mechanism. It reconvened in the evening to discuss  the text on adverse effects.

In the afternoon session, delegates discussed bracketed text in  the Annex to the draft decision on capacity building in developing  countries. Parties disagreed over the placement of several  paragraphs that addressed guidance to the financial mechanism. On  financial resources for the implementation of Stage II adaptation  activities, delegates agreed to a proposal by CANADA to refer to  national adaptation plans of action (NAPAs).

On the funding of capacity building for disasters related to  climate change, the EU, NORWAY and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern about overburdening the GEF. The US  suggested deleting reference to the building of 'institutional  capacity,' while the EU proposed that capacity building not  include the 'management' of disasters. Co-Chair Ashe suggested  that the GEF shall provide financial resources to build  institutional capacity 'where appropriate' and that the funding of  the 'management' of disasters be put in brackets. The text, as  amended by Co-Chair Ashe, was set aside for discussion at a later  date.

On early warning systems, the EU, opposed by the G-77/CHINA,  suggested deleting the reference to the funding for the  establishment, where needed, of such systems. Co-Chair Ashe  bracketed the text accordingly.

On text requesting the GEF to provide funding for the  implementation of the capacity building framework, the G-77/CHINA  suggested that the language agreed upon in the draft decision on  capacity building should replace the current text. The US, with  the EU, preferred working on the basis of the current text. The US  also expressed concern at placing all responsibility of  implementation on the GEF, proposing instead that this entity  'support the implementation,' rather than 'implement,' the  framework. Co-Chair Ashe suggested both texts be discussed at a  later stage, and expressed concern at the lack of significant  progress.

In the evening, delegates met to discuss the negotiating text on  adverse effects, starting with Section A under adverse effects of  climate change. NORWAY, supported by CANADA and the EU, suggested  using President Pronk's consolidated negotiating text for the  discussions. Participants discussed the implications of relying on  sources of information other than national communications to carry  out an assessment and evaluation to determine action related to  adaptation. The G-77/CHINA supported using other relevant  information, and underscored their commitment to carrying out  national communications, despite limited resources and capacity.  Many Annex I Parties expressed concern at making language on the  source of this information too vague.

On text referring to the specific concerns of least developed  countries (LDCs) on adaptation activities, UGANDA, supported by  SENEGAL and MALI, emphasized the inclusion of this reference. The  G-77/CHINA said this reference was redundant due to the new terms  of reference of the LDC group of experts text, which would be  integrated into the negotiating text. The EU suggested retaining  the brackets around this reference.

On Section B under adverse effects of climate change, several  delegates noted agreement on the text, although overall issues  related to funding would have to be resolved before the brackets  could be removed. CANADA said those activities to be covered by  the GEF would have to be differentiated from those that are not.  The G-77/CHINA noted the need to separate funds related to the  UNFCCC and the Protocol. The US said it will contribute to UNFCCC  activities, adding that it will be useful to consider how funds  can be 'co-mingled' with other sources.

SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern at the lack of progress, stressing  the need to have sufficient time to negotiate all the 'developing  country' issues that had been placed in this negotiating group by  President Pronk. CANADA, with the EU, disagreed that no progress  had been made.

### MECHANISMS

The mechanisms group met in the evening, to discuss  text on the modalities and procedures for the CDM. Delegates  sought areas for agreement by comparing Pronk's proposed text with  negotiating text carried forward from The Hague. They agreed to  commence discussions on the three separate decisions on  mechanisms, noting that this would not prejudice whether there  would be one or three decisions. On the role of the COP/MOP, some  support was expressed for Pronk's proposed text. Diverging views  were expressed on the composition of the Executive Board, and  discussion on this issue was deferred.

On accreditation and designation of operational entities, NORWAY  supported Pronk's text subject to 'minor technical issues.' SAMOA  and TANZANIA underlined concerns with the inclusion of sinks in  the CDM. The EU said the sinks issue must be decided at a high  political level.

On eligibility, Co-Chair Estrada noted that this was completely  reformulated in the Pronk text, which aimed to combine the various  options. JAPAN proposed deleting the notion of project  eligibility. NORWAY, SWITZERLAND, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA and the EU  expressed general support for the Pronk proposal. The EU and CHINA  requested including reference to CDM being a partnership between  Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. JAPAN, NIGERIA and the US  expressed concern with the requirement that an Annex I Party's use  of CERs is conditional on it being a Party to the 'Agreement on  Procedures and Mechanisms on Compliance supplementing the Kyoto  Protocol to the UNFCCC.' SAMOA said she could not consider the  principle that there be resumed eligibility after a certain time  has elapsed.

On validation and registration, the EU supported the Pronk text as  a good basis for negotiation. AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and CANADA opposed  text requiring environmental impact assessments for every project  activity. AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, opposed by SAMOA, disagreed with  preferential treatment on the crediting period for small-scale  project activities. CHINA urged provision for technology transfer  and environmental additionality. TUVALU proposed bracketing  reference to leakage. On supplementarity, NIGERIA sought clarity  on reference to Annex I Parties meeting emissions reduction  commitments 'chiefly' through domestic action, and underlined the  importance of equitable geographic distribution of CDM projects.  Delegates did not complete discussions on monitoring, verification  and certification, and issuance of certified emission reductions.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As the opening day of the resumed COP-6 drew to a close Monday  evening, many participants seemed skeptical about the prospects  for a successful outcome. Several noted that the atmosphere seemed  'flat' or that participants were suffering from 'negotiating  fatigue.' Pointing to ongoing differences on key issues such as  sinks and finance, some added that a successful conclusion -  assuming it happens at all - might have to wait until COP-7.  However, in spite of this general mood, a number of delegates  remained upbeat, arguing that a result in Bonn was still possible  if government ministers could reach a political agreement during  the high-level talks set to start Thursday evening.
