abstract: "On Monday, delegates to COP-10 met in contact groups throughout  the day, in an effort to complete work by the closure of SBSTA-21  and SBI-21 scheduled for Tuesday, 14 December. SBI contact groups  addressed UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public  awareness), and progress on the implementation of decision 5/CP.7  (adverse effects). SBSTA contact groups took up: registry systems  under Protocol Article 7.4; technology transfer; good practice  guidance (GPG) for LULUCF activities, harvested wood products  (HWP) and other issues relating to LULUCF; scientific, technical  and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation (mitigation); and  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change (adaptation).  Informal consultations were held on numerous issues, including  matters related to the least developed countries (LDCs), the  financial mechanism and capacity building."

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Chair Crispin d'Auvergne introduced revised  draft conclusions and a draft decision. Parties approved both  texts with minor amendments, and agreed to forward them to SBI for  consideration.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Parties reviewed text in a Co-Chairs' non-paper  focusing on the impacts of the implementation of response measures.  The EU, US and AUSTRALIA questioned the need for 'forums' on  insurance for adverse effects of response measures and on economic  diversification prior to such adverse effects becoming apparent,  but stated that a one-off event on modeling may be of value. The  G-77/CHINA said events on insurance, modeling and economic  diversification should take place in the form of expert groups.  The US, supported by CANADA and the EU, said text on mobilizing  resources for implementation should mirror language in decision  5/CP.7. SAUDI ARABIA supported the language in the non-paper,  emphasizing the need for action on this issue. Discussions  continued informally.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLE 7.4

Delegates considered a revised draft  decision on issues relating to registry systems that had resulted  from informal consultations, and worked through the text  paragraph-by-paragraph, focusing on paragraphs where previous  changes had been made. CANADA preferred to reflect that groups  other than Parties are also developing registries, and that  appropriate ways to exchange technical information with  administrators of similar types of registry systems should be  explored. Regarding the test plan and schedules for the  initialization of the electronic communications with registry  systems, the EU preferred this to be carried out prior to  COP/MOP-1 in order to ensure the prompt start of the CDM. CHINA  expressed concern about the verification of the tests.

Chair Murray Ward presented delegates with three paragraphs, to be  taken as a package, requesting the Secretariat to convene  consultations at SBSTA-22 on the checks to be performed by the  international transaction log (ITL) and their conformity with the  provisions of relevant COP decisions. The text also requests the  Secretariat, as administrator of the ITL, to report the results of  the standardized testing and independent assessment of the ITL and  the outcomes of the SBSTA-22 consultations. It then invites  COP/MOP-1 to approve the operation of the ITL. The contact group  continued consultations informally throughout the day and into  the night.

### LULUCF

Eugene Hendrick (Ireland) reported on the informal  drafting group on HWP. He proposed new text inviting Parties,  inter alia, to: submit data and information on HWP if they have  not done so already, and provide updated information on experience  with the IPCC 1996 Greenhouse Gas Inventory Guidelines and the GPG  Appendix on the HWP methodological issues, by 1 August 2005. The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION cautioned that the HWP methodology should not  be addressed prior to the completion of the GPG, as  inconsistencies could arise. He also proposed deletion of  reference to the GPG Appendix. BRAZIL, for the G-77/China,  proposed that submitting data and information on HWP should  explicitly apply to Annex I Parties. The US, with CANADA and the  EU, proposed that non-Annex I Parties should also be allowed to  submit information if they wish to do so. The G-77/CHINA requested  time to consult on the issue internally. Following informal  discussions, delegates agreed to refer only to Annex I Parties.

Peter Brisbane (Australia), facilitator of the drafting group on  the organization of a technical LULUCF workshop before COP-11,  reported that Parties had not been able to reach consensus. AOSIS  expressed willingness to move forward on the issue, but emphasized  that a dialogue on issues related to the second and subsequent  commitment periods must consider wider matters. Parties reached  consensus on a paragraph relating to the possible application of  biome-specific forest definitions. Delegates agreed to forward the  draft conclusions to SBSTA-22.

### MITIGATION

Co-Chair Toshiyuki Sakamoto introduced a draft  decision based on informal consultations. The G-77/CHINA  reiterated that socioeconomic aspects and technological  cooperation should be given greater emphasis in the text.  AUSTRALIA noted that discussions should not be limited to  bilateral activities, but should include multilateral and  international activities. Regarding themes for a future SBSTA  in-session workshop on mitigation, Parties discussed whether the  workshop proposal should specifically mention renewable energy and  efficiency, or regulatory policies and frameworks. SAUDI ARABIA  reiterated the need to focus on existing technologies and, opposed  by AUSTRALIA, CANADA, US, CHILE, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN, pointed to  the necessity to address the spillover effects of mitigation. He  said land-use changes and non-CO2 gases should also be addressed.  The EU, supported by the US, proposed addressing co-benefits.  Opposed by AUSTRALIA, CANADA, US, CHILE, NEW ZEALAND and JAPAN,  the EU, with NORWAY, proposed focusing on energy efficiency and  renewables, as well as policy and regulatory frameworks. The US  said that he did not object to renewable energy, but would prefer  no reference to it in the text.

CHINA said policies and frameworks are not technological issues,  while the EU argued that they are related to barriers and  deployment. On renewable energy, CANADA, with the G-77/CHINA and  SAUDI ARABIA, argued that no specific technology should be  promoted. SAUDI ARABIA reminded Parties that the UNFCCC is not an  energy convention. The US stressed the need to focus on practical  opportunities and solutions. Agreement could not be reached, and  discussions continued informally into the night.

### ADAPTATION

Co-Chair Philip Gwage asked delegates to comment on an  Argentine proposal to adopt a work programme on adaptation.  Describing the proposal, ARGENTINA proposed to adopt a substantive  decision on adaptation, and outlined elements for a work programme  on adaptation that seeks to, inter alia, address the domestic  measures that Parties should take to adapt to climate change and  climate variability. He identified a list of elements for future  work on: data and methodologies; vulnerability assessment;  adaptation planning; integration of adaptation into sustainable  development; and adaptation actions.

The EU said the roles of SBSTA, SBI and the COP should be  clarified. She also said that this agenda item should not focus on  adaptation only, but should include aspects of impacts and  vulnerability as well. MICRONESIA said that adaptation actions are  key, and expressed concern that the proposed time-frame to conduct  assessments during 2005-9 is too long, considering the urgency of  the matter. JAPAN said that adaptation is an important issue but  expressed concern over the discussions underway on decision  5/CP.7. He stressed that consistency should be kept between  decisions on both agenda items.

SUDAN, on behalf of the Africa Group, supported the proposal and  said the SBSTA-21 in-session workshop results should be included.  SOUTH AFRICA underscored that it is important to have a work  programme on this issue, and to put existing knowledge to use.  CHINA, supported by SOUTH AFRICA and ARGENTINA, said that most of  the proposed actions should be adopted by States and that the  Argentine proposal could be included in the draft decision  requesting SBSTA to organize an in-session workshop on these  issues.

ARGENTINA said that his country's proposal sought to address  adaptation in a substantive manner and to provide a clear  political, scientific and technological framework for action. He  emphasized that the proposal includes only the scientific aspects  of adaptation, as there had been no consensus on SBI and SBSTA  working together on this matter.

The US commended the Argentine proposal but preferred to postpone  making a decision until discussions on the implementation of  decision 5/CP.7 conclude, to prevent overlaps. PERU considered  implementation of decision 5/CP.7 a prerequisite for the type of  assessment outlined in the Argentine proposal. AUSTRALIA,  supported by the EU, noted that the proposal establishes a  framework for a programme of work, and that the programme itself  and its detailed activities could be adopted at a later stage.  Discussions continued into the night.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The contact group, co-chaired by Kishan  Kumarsingh and Holger Liptow, met in the evening. Tentative  agreement on the draft conclusions' paragraph on fossil fuels was  reached informally earlier in the day, paving the way for further  discussion on a draft decision. The Co-Chairs introduced a revised  text on a draft decision. Issues related to networking between the  UNFCCC's technology clearing house (TT:CLEAR) and technology  information centers were agreed. Discussions then focused on: the  Expert Group on Technology Transfer's (EGTT) framework for  enhancing implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology  transfer); terms of reference for this framework; and the review  of EGTT as mandated by decision 4/CP.7 (development and transfer  of technologies). The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, EU, CANADA  and AUSTRALIA, proposed to include reference to the implementation  of the framework.

The US asked for confirmation that the draft conclusions had been  agreed, and the G-77/CHINA expressed that without agreement on the  decision, the informally agreed draft conclusions remain  unapproved as well.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Returning to La Rural after their leisurely day off, delegates  appear to have suddenly recalled that SBI and SBSTA are supposed  to complete their work and close by Tuesday, 14 December.  Observers commented that morning contact groups had been quickly  converted into informal consultations, apparently to get the 'real  work done.' This may indicate that deliberations have not made  sufficient progress.

While the Argentine proposal on an adaptation work programme has  finally been circulated, the corridors were buzzing about the  rumored decision on seminars to address the future of the climate  regime beyond 2012. Elsewhere, many delegates were also commenting  on the draft text on input into other multilateral processes,  which has been prepared before any informal consultations have  been held. Observers noted that this would make it the second  attempt to table something on this agenda item without holding  prior discussions.
