# OPENING OF THE SESSION

S.N. Sok Appadu, Mauritius Meteorological Service, opened the  session and welcomed delegates. In thanking Mauritius for hosting  the meeting, IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri (India) noted the  importance to Mauritius of assessing climate change because of  potential sea level rise and the role of agriculture in its  economy. He highlighted the benefits of holding IPCC meetings in  different locations, including the opportunity for IPCC members to  interact with local scientific and governmental experts. IPCC  Chair Pachauri suggested that delegates, in starting to think  about the future work of the IPCC, allow new ideas to stimulate  discussions.

Hong Yan, Deputy Secretary-General, WMO, noted the commitment of  Mauritius to meeting the challenge of climate change. He said the  IPCC has become an authoritative voice on the science of climate  change and added that several decisions taken at COP/MOP 1 and COP  11 were based on IPCC findings. He also indicated the readiness of  WMO bodies to cooperate with the IPCC.

Alexander Alusa, Division for Environmental Conventions, UNEP,  highlighted the IPCC's experience in informing the climate change  debate and in triggering cooperative action. He underscored UNEP's  intention to support the IPCC in disseminating the results of the  AR4 as widely as possible and noted that UNEP's Information Unit  for Conventions is already disseminating a simplified version of  the Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage.

Halldor Thorgeirsson, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC, noted  the development of the carbon market under the Kyoto Protocol and  the impacts of the IPCC's work on the UNFCCC agenda. On important  areas for the interplay of science and policy, he referred to the  five year programme of work on adaptation and to the proposal  under the UNFCCC to address emissions from deforestation.  Thorgeirsson drew attention to the reference to the IPCC in the  COP's decision on long-term cooperative action on climate change  under the UNFCCC and stressed the IPCC's role in directly  influencing national positions.

Anil Bachoo, Minister of Environment and National Development  Unit, Mauritius, urged the IPCC to provide regionally relevant  information to developing countries and cautioned that the full  impacts of climate change on the ecosystems of small island  developing states may not be appreciated due to lack of  information and scientific research.

# APPROVAL OF THE IPCC-24 DRAFT REPORT

Delegates approved the draft report as presented (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 2),  noting that the Panel can consider decisions taken at IPCC-24  again at this meeting under the relevant agenda items.

# IPCC PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2006-09

Renate Christ, IPCC Executive Secretary, introduced the IPCC  Programme and Budget for 2006-09 (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 3, Add. 1) and  emphasized that any decisions taken at this meeting will need to  be reflected in the budgets for future years. With IPCC Chair  Pachauri, she stressed the need for governments to make their  financial contributions for 2006.

During the lunch break, the FTT, co-chaired by Marc Gillet  (France) and Zhenlin Chen (China), held its first meeting. The FTT  will prepare a draft decision for approval by the plenary.  Discussion centered on the reasons for consistent budgetary  carryovers, including the possibility that such carryovers might  be a disincentive to future government contributions to the IPCC.  The FTT will reconvene on Thursday morning, at which time the  Secretariat will present a summary of expected expenses until the  end of this assessment period (2008), while the Technical Support  Units (TSUs) will provide additional information on their own  activities.

# 2006 GUIDELINES

Co-Chair of the Bureau of the Task Force on National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories (TFB) Thelma Krug (Brazil) introduced the draft  2006 Guidelines (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 4b). She explained that more than  100 comments from 17 governments were received and addressed, and  that the resulting revisions were contained in a new document  (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 4b, Add. 1).

The RUSSIAN FEDERATION requested clarification on whether all  government comments had been taken into account and on the timing  for use of the new methodologies. BRAZIL expressed concern that  its submission on estimating emissions from flooded lands had not  been taken into account and expressed reservations about  acceptance of the 2006 Guidelines as drafted. GERMANY, supported  by NORWAY, requested more time to consider the revisions contained  in IPCC-XXV/Doc. 4b, Add. 1. AUSTRIA and NORWAY supported BRAZIL's  reservation on estimates from flooded lands and cautioned against  possible inconsistencies in the methodologies when used at the  project level. FINLAND requested clarification on the role and  classification of peat. Noting that the section on flooded lands  represented a prudent compromise, CANADA supported acceptance of  the 2006 Guidelines as drafted. CHINA proposed deletion of the  reference to spontaneous combustion, stating that this represents  a natural phenomenon and not an anthropogenic source. EGYPT called  for the inclusion of the global warming potential of aerosols,  particularly from industry. The US cautioned against further  changes to the document, stating that the 2006 Guidelines were  designed as a comprehensive package and underscoring the danger of  deleting sections or relegating them to appendices.

In a lunchtime question and answer session with the Coordinating  Lead Authors, delegates discussed carbon stock versus flux methods  to calculate emissions from flooded lands and the potential for  overestimating and double counting. They agreed to continue, in a  contact group, discussions on how to incorporate into the section  of the 2006 Guidelines on flooded lands pertinent sections of the  IPCC Good Practice Guidance for LULUCF. Delegates also agreed to  keep in an appendix a reference to methane from wetlands and  discussed spontaneous combustion and a range of other comments  submitted previously by governments.

In the afternoon plenary session, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION,  supported by SAUDI ARABIA and SWITZERLAND, requested that the  compilation of governments' comments on the 2006 Guidelines be  made available to the plenary. TFB Co-Chair Taka Hiraishi (Japan)  stated that it was not the practice of the IPCC to distribute  these to everyone, and the IPCC Secretariat explained that all  written comments are available upon request. BRAZIL stressed the  need to resolve pending matters in the 2006 Guidelines before  proceeding to the Overview Chapter.

The UK, supported by MAURITIUS, NORWAY, CANADA, MOROCCO and  others, underscored the importance of accepting the 2006  Guidelines and adopting the Overview Chapter at this session.  Urging parties to be practical, he called for focusing on specific  aspects of the 2006 Guidelines in a contact group and for  discussing the Overview Chapter in the plenary.

Chair Pachauri said the Secretariat would make electronic copies  and a limited number of paper copies of governments' comments  available by Thursday morning, but cautioned against delaying  acceptance of the 2006 Guidelines at this session given the amount  of work ahead in relation to the AR4. He announced that contact  group discussions would convene in the evening and possibly on  Thursday morning to address particular issues in the 2006  Guidelines raised during the day.

# FURTHER WORK ON EMISSIONS SCENARIOS

Following a brief introduction by IPCC Secretary Christ, IPCC  Chair Pauchari summarized his proposal for a decision on further  work on emissions scenarios (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 17). Discussion on how  to proceed was based on this proposal, the recommendations of the  TGNES (IPCC-XXV/Doc. 11), and a letter from John Mitchell, Chief  Scientist of the Met Office, UK, regarding new IPCC emissions  scenarios (IPCC-XXV/INF. 6).

Several delegates, including SUDAN, KENYA, INDIA, SPAIN, VENEZULA,  GERMANY, and FRANCE, supported moving forward with new scenarios.  FRANCE added that integrated scenarios might be beyond the scope  of the IPCC, and, with the NETHERLANDS and others, noted the need  to focus on a small number of scenarios. CHINA expressed concern  that moving forward on new scenarios at present could draw  resources away from the AR4 and suggested delaying work on  scenarios. The UK indicated that there is a requirement beyond  pure assessment that needs to be recognized. AUSTRALIA said it is  important to ensure that any new process is clearly differentiated  from previous processes. Many delegates stressed the need for  developing country participation. The US explained the importance  of taking a fundamental decision on the IPCC's role in new  emissions scenarios and, with SAUDI ARABIA, noted that the IPCC  should not go beyond a facilitation role by commissioning or  directing scenario development as this could compromise its  assessment role.

IPCC Chair Pachauri closed by noting the importance of alerting  the scientific community to a modeling framework and of quickly  embarking upon a course of action. He also underscored the  involvement of experts from developing countries.

In an evening contact group, delegates continued discussions on  emissions scenarios, discussing topics such as the definition of  the term 'coordination' and the importance of ensuring broad  support for the role of the IPCC. The US stressed the function of  assessment over coordination and discussed the importance of  continued involvement from the US climate modeling community.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates at IPCC-25 were in good spirits on Wednesday, despite  having an ambitious agenda to get through and a number of  potential pitfalls in the way. Newcomers to the process may have  felt that progress in plenary was slow going, but veteran  observers were more sanguine. One observer's prediction that the  meeting would include the 'usual mischief making' seemed well  placed, as discussions on the 2006 Guidelines were held up on a  couple of technical and procedural issues. Progress was also  protracted, as several participants expected, on flooded lands.

With only one day of the meeting gone, the mood at the close of  the session remained upbeat, even though many delegates had to  forgo the evening reception to continue contact group discussions,  and many were scheduled to return early on Thursday morning for  more of the same. Several delegates were optimistic that momentum  would increase over the next two days.
