Over 4000 participants are expected to attend the session, where  delegates will continue to address a number of issues.  Participants will consider financial matters, including the  Secretariat's programme budget for 2004-5 and the Special Climate  Change Fund, as well as other issues related to the review of  implementation of commitments and provisions of the UNFCCC. Issues  related to the preparations for the first session of the COP  serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol  (COP/MOP-1) will also be addressed, including land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF) activities under Protocol Article 12  (Clean Development Mechanism). A high-level segment including  round-table discussions will be held from 10-11 December.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  sustainable development, with negative impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and a majority of  scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is  necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 188 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, and charged it with reaching agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  (EITs) to achieve quantified emission reduction targets. These  countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to  reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at least  5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment  period), with specific targets varying from country to country.  The Protocol also established three mechanisms to assist Annex I  Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively: an  emissions trading system; joint implementation (JI) of emissions- reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and a Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM) that encourages projects in non-Annex  I (developing country) Parties.

At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how countries will cut emissions  and measure and assess emissions reductions. To enter into force,  the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, and by  Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total carbon  dioxide emissions for 1990. To date, 120 Parties have ratified the  Protocol, including 32 Annex I Parties, representing 44.2% of the  emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

In November 1998, Parties met at  COP-4 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and agreed to a set of decisions  known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The BAPA set  COP-6 as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational  details of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the  UNFCCC. Issues to be addressed included rules relating to the  mechanisms, a regime for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting  methods for national emissions and emissions reductions, and rules  on crediting countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC  requiring resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed SB-13 were held in The Hague,  the Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000. During the second week  of negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk (the Netherlands)  attempted to facilitate negotiations on the many disputed  political and technical issues by convening high-level informal  Plenary sessions. After almost 36 hours of intense talks in the  final two days of COP-6, negotiators could not agree on a range of  topics, particularly financial issues, supplementarity in the use  of the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF. On Saturday afternoon,  25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates had failed  to reach agreement. Delegates then agreed to suspend COP-6 and  resume negotiations in 2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  agreement reached in Kyoto, stating that it considered the  Protocol to be 'fatally flawed,' as it would damage its economy  and exempt key developing countries from emissions reduction  targets. Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II and SB-14 from 16-27  July 2001, in Bonn, Germany. After protracted consultations,  President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft political  decision. Despite support from several Parties, disagreements  surfaced over the nature of the compliance regime. After several  days of consultations, ministers agreed to adopt President Pronk's  political decision, with a revised section on compliance on 25  July 2001. The political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - needed  to be operationalized through COP decisions. These decisions were  considered a 'package,' and since no agreement was reached on the  mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF, all draft decisions were  forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates continued discussions on the 'Bonn Agreements' at  COP-7 and SB-15 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10  November 2001. After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on  LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), and  input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was  proposed. Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups,  some Annex I Parties, including Australia, Canada, Japan, New  Zealand, and the Russian Federation, did not join the consensus,  disputing, among other things, eligibility requirements and credit  banking under the mechanisms. However, following extensive  negotiations, the 'Marrakesh Accords' were agreed.

### SB-16

Parties met at SB-16 in Bonn from 5-14 June 2002.  Participants considered several issues previously left off the  agenda due to the pressing BAPA negotiations. Views on the  direction of the climate process differed, with some Parties  looking back to recent debates and others looking ahead toward the  next commitment period. Many hoped the Protocol could enter into  force by the WSSD in August 2002. The EU and Japan announced their  Protocol ratifications just prior to the WSSD.

### COP-8

Delegates to COP-8 and SB-17 met from 23 October to 1  November 2002, in New Delhi, India. On the final day of COP-8,  they adopted the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and  Sustainable Development. The Declaration reaffirms development and  poverty eradication as overriding priorities in developing  counties, and recognizes Parties' common but differentiated  responsibilities and national development priorities and  circumstances in the implementation of UNFCCC commitments. Parties  at COP-8 considered institutional and procedural issues under the  Protocol and adopted several decisions, including on the rules and  procedures for the Executive Board (EB) of the CDM.

### SB-18

Delegates to SB-18 met in Bonn from 4-13 June 2003, and  continued to address issues under negotiation since COP-8 and  prepare for the Kyoto Protocol's entry into force. Conclusions  were agreed on a number of issues, but the issue of the  Secretariat's programme budget for 2004-5 and the Special Climate  Change Fund proved to be particularly difficult, and will be  further considered at COP-9.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### WORKSHOPS ON SYNERGIES AND COOPERATION WITH OTHER CONVENTIONS

Two  workshops, one mandated by SBI-15, and the other mandated by  SBSTA-17, were held back-to-back in Espoo, Finland, from 2-4 July  2003. Participants discussed different approaches to addressing  synergies among MEAs, focusing on several challenges, including:  principles to guide efforts to achieve synergies; practical ways  to achieve synergies at the national level; the role of the  international community in providing impetus to achieving  synergies; and enhancement of synergies and linkages at the  convention level by the international community. Participants also  heard presentations on national experiences in achieving synergies  and discussed cross-cutting areas under the UNFCCC, the UN  Convention to Combat Desertification and the Convention on  Biological Diversity.

### WORLD CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE

The World Climate Change  Conference was held from 29 September to 3 October 2003 in Moscow,  the Russian Federation, and was aimed primarily at the scientific  community to address divergent views on existing scientific  findings, including those reflected in the IPCC Third Assessment  Report (TAR).

### WORKSHOP ON ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION

This workshop, mandated by  decision 5/CP.7 (adverse effects), was held from 18-19 October  2003, in Tehran, Iran. Participants discussed the needs and  options of non-Annex I Parties regarding the need to address  economic diversification in the contexts of the adverse effects of  climate change and the impact of the implementation of response  measures. Participants also considered possible support programmes  by Annex II Parties to address developing country needs for  economic diversification.

### EXPERT WORKSHOP ON LOCAL COPING STRATEGIES AND TECHNOLOGIES FOR  ADAPTATION

This workshop was held in New Delhi, India, from 12-13  November 2003, in conjunction with the Climate Technology Bazaar  and Conferences hosted by the Government of India. Participants  addressed local coping strategies in the context of the science  and methodologies for adaptation to climate change. They also held  an exchange of experiences on coping strategies and technologies,  addressing cross-cutting issues, drought and aridity, and floods,  cyclones and tropical storms.

### MEETINGS OF CONSTITUTED BODIES

Several meetings of the UNFCCC's  constituted bodies have been held since SB-18. The CDM EB met for  its tenth meeting from 28-29 July 2003, in Bonn, and for its  eleventh meeting from 16-17 October 2003, also in Bonn. The Least  Developed Countries (LDCs) Expert Group (LEG) held its fourth  meeting in Thimpu, Bhutan, on 8 and 12-13 September. The  Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I national  communications (CGE) met from 23-24 September 2003, in Mexico  City, Mexico. A special meeting of the Expert Group on Technology  Transfer (EGTT) was held from 11-12 November 2003, in New Delhi,  India.

### PRE-SESSIONAL CONSULTATIONS

Pre-sessional consultations were held  in Milan in the days leading up to COP-9, addressing: the IPCC  TAR; registry systems; definitions and modalities for including  afforestation and reforestation activities under the CDM; and the  implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects) and  progress on the implementation of activities under the related  decision 5/CP.7. The twelfth meeting of the CDM EB was held from  27-28 November, and the EGTT convened its fourth meeting from 28- 29 November.
