# AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE

The third meeting of the AGBM convened to consider Agenda  Item 3 (strengthening commitments) on Articles 4.2(a)  (national policies) and (b) (communications) of the FCCC.  Kilaparti Ramakrishna (Woods Hole Research Center) reported  on a Round Table concerning impacts on developing countries  of new commitments by Annex I Parties.

The Chair summarized discussion under the agenda item. He  regretted that very little was done to narrow down policies  and measures issues. Outstanding issues on QELROs include  emission levels, whether commitments should be binding,  multiparty obligations, and base and target years. Some  delegations believe the SAR provides the basis for ambitious  QELROs. Several supported QELROs in the AOSIS protocol.  Uncertainties remain about costs and impacts of GHG  reductions. A number stressed flexibility and  differentiation of commitments, possibly including different  base years to take account of national circumstances. Some  questioned the possibility of agreeing differentiated  policies in time. The Chair will include a request for a  follow-up meeting and the view that non-action is not an  option in his report. SAUDI ARABIA requested that an  assessment of impacts be annexed to a protocol. Reports from  the three Round Table Chairs will be annexed to the Report  of the AGBM Session.

Under Agenda Item 6 (taking stock, report to COP), the Chair  said that one year remains to complete the work. Assessment  and analysis has not been concluded and little has been done  on the negotiations. The AGBM will meet three times before  COP-3. A number of proposals are on the table and the Chair  hopes further proposals will follow. He adopted an EU  proposal inviting governments to send new suggestions or  proposals until October 1996. SAUDI ARABIA said a mechanism  must be found to keep non-Annex I Parties informed about  discussion in Annex I Parties. The EU noted its concern that  the process is not advancing as intended. A first draft  protocol should be under negotiation at AGBM-6.

The AGBM Chair invited comments on his Draft Conclusions  (FCCC/AGBM/1996/L.2). The EU and Saudi Arabia objected to a  reference to an 'equation' to express linkage between  policies and measures and QELROs. In a paragraph on  elaboration of policies and measures the US, supported by  AUSTRALIA, objected to the inclusion of 'a menu approach.'  FRANCE qualified a reference to harmonized policies and  measures by prefacing the reference with 'and/or'. GERMANY  replaced mandatory with 'required' approach to policies and  measures. AUSTRALIA incorporated sentences from the fourth  paragraph, which notes the argument that no set of policies  and measures may be appropriate for all Annex I Parties and  concerns about competition.

On the paragraph concerning the adoption of policies and  measures, SAUDI ARABIA called for language noting the need  for further studies. The EU proposed that action be  'coordinated' rather than 'common or harmonized'. KUWAIT  said policies and measures should be assessed in terms of  their 'economic' costs and their impact on developing  countries. GERMANY and the US recommended that  'environmental' costs and benefits be considered and EGYPT  said their role in enhancing carbon sinks should also be  noted. The paragraph was adopted to reflect that several  criteria were identified for assessing policies and measures  including their: potential to limit GHG emissions and  enhance carbon sinks; economic costs and benefits; long and  short term impact on economic growth in developing  countries; and political feasibility as well as the need for  coordinated action.

In a paragraph dealing with outstanding issues on QELROs,  KENYA, supported by the US, FRANCE and GERMANY, noted that  it was left open whether the level of emission reductions  should be politically or scientifically based. KUWAIT  proposed that QELROs' impact on the economic and social  structure of developing countries as well as their effect on  atmospheric GHG concentrations be recognized. These  proposals were adopted.

The paragraph relating to the SAR was adopted without  amendment in recognition of SBSTA's administration of the  issue. After CHINA, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT,  VENEZUELA and COLOMBIA, objected to joint implementation and  tradable emission permits in a paragraph on mechanisms to  promote flexibility, the US inserted an additional reference  to specify Annex I Parties. In a paragraph on approaches to  differentiation of commitments, AUSTRALIA added a proposal  based on 'projected' emission trends. The NETHERLANDS added  market-based differentiation mechanisms. In a paragraph  concerning the impact of Annex I commitments on developing  countries, SAUDI ARABIA, supported by KUWAIT, added  references to burden sharing for all Parties and relevant  studies. PERU specified negative impacts.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

On the development and transfer of technology and the  establishment of a roster of experts, the Chair stated that  while both issues were to be resolved jointly between the  subsidiary bodies, the SBI will manage their remaining  progress, given the technical nature of the issues. The  Chair proposed a revised draft decision on use of the SAR.  The decision notes the Parties' differing opinions on the  SAR and SBSTA's inability to achieve consensus on the issue.  A final decision should be left to the COP.

NIGERIA requested that the different views be presented in a  non-biased way. The MARSHALL ISLANDS expressed concern that  presenting the two views equally would not accurately  reflect what transpired in SBSTA, because a majority of  Parties endorsed the SAR. Following distribution of the  Chair's written text, several Parties said that it did not  accurately reflect his stated proposal. The Chair then noted  that the original bracketed text or the revised draft were  the only options left at this stage. SAUDI ARABIA stated  that several delegations have accepted proposals that they  did not completely support in order to avoid using brackets.  If brackets are included here, then other decisions may have  to be reconsidered.

The Chair then proposed using the original text and noting  that SBSTA 'took note of' the two views on the SAR, rather  than 'decides'. Several delegations, including KUWAIT,  CANADA, the MARSHALL ISLANDS, and the EU objected. The US,  supported by AUSTRALIA, proposed language urging the COP to  take a decision on the issue at this session, and the EU  objected.

The Chair reminded delegates that there were no more SBSTA  meetings in this session and the only option is the original  text. He noted the attempts to avoid brackets, but said it  cannot avoided at this point. SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT and OMAN  voiced strong objections, but the Chair noted many  delegations could not accept the revised version. He will  provide a full explanation of the results with his summary.  Many delegations recorded objections, including SAUDI  ARABIA, KUWAIT, QATAR, NIGERIA, OMAN, UAE, KUWAIT, LEBANON,  CHINA, SYRIA and JORDAN.

SBSTA also considered the draft decisions of the contact  group on communications from non-Annex I Parties, which  incorporates several additional responsibilities. BRAZIL  said that the contact group decided that its work would not  be prejudiced by the COP's decision on guidelines for  initial communications on the abatement of emissions.  Several delegations, including CHINA, KUWAIT, INDIA, COSTA  RICA, the PHILIPPINES, CANADA, the US and JAPAN, endorsed  the decisions and acknowledged the cooperative efforts of  non-Annex I Parties. The EU recognized the added  responsibilities for non-Annex I Parties. The PHILIPPINES  also linked the expanded commitments of non-Annex I Parties  to their potential role in obtaining funding.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

SBI met to consider a number of draft decisions negotiated  in closed contact groups. The draft decision on Agenda Item  3(b) (non-Annex I communications) addresses assistance to  developing country Parties in preparing initial  communications, and in its Annex lists guidelines for the  preparation of these reports. The draft decision was  adopted. The draft decision on Agenda Item 5 (technology  transfer) addresses transfer of environmentally-sound  technology (EST) and calls for measures such as reports,  workshops and a roster of experts to expedite this. The  draft decision was adopted.

The session then adopted a draft decision on Agenda Item 6  (activities implemented jointly), which is also on the  agenda of SBSTA and had been negotiated by that body. The  WORLD BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  underscored the role of the private sector in AIJ for the  transfer of ESTs. The draft decison on Agenda Item 4(a)(i)  (guidance to the GEF) emphasizes provision of agreed full  costs by the GEF for preparation of national communications  by non-Annex I Parties. The draft decision was adopted. The  PHILIPPINES emphasized the paragraph calling on non-Annex I  Parties to follow guidelines and format adopted by COP-2.  The US supported this and highlighted other guidelines for  the GEF as well.

The draft decision on Agenda Item 4(a)(ii) (Annex to the MOU  between COP and GEF) had not been agreed to prior to the  meeting. The Chair referred the matter to the Bureau. INDIA  highlighted a paper by the G-77/CHINA which sets out  concerns on the Annex. SBI also adopted draft decisions on  Agenda Item 4(b) (Secretariat activities relating to  technical and financial support to Parties) and Item 7(a)  (establishment of the permanent secretariat).

Delegates also considered a recommendation on the volume of  documentation. On Agenda Item 3(a) (Annex I national  communications), the Chair of the contact group presented  the draft conclusions of SBI-3 and a draft decision to be  submitted by the Chair. KUWAIT, OMAN and SAUDI ARABIA  requested more time for consideration. The Chair reminded  delegates that there had been many consultations on this  item and the conclusions and decision were adopted. SBI also  accepted the draft decision on its programme of work. On  Agenda Item 5 (a) (implementation of Article 4), delegates  recommended that COP refer review until COP-3. Delegates  also accepted the draft report of SBI-3 (FCCC/SBI/1996/L.3).

# IN THE CORRIDORS I

Some delegations are reported to have expressed interest in  supporting a new NGO initiative that will highlight the  concerns of both vulnerable and low island states. The group  will combine demands for 'contraction' (60% reduction of  global fossil fusel use within a given time-frame) and  'convergence' (an equity principle based on convergence of  above-par and below-par per capita consumption of fossil- carbon).

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

A contact group of the SBI failed to agree on a draft  decision, SBI Agenda Item 4(a)(ii), defining the Annex to  the Memorandum of Understanding between the COP and the GEF  Council. The Annex is intended to specify funding necessary  to implement the FCCC. According to observers, a compromise  measure requesting the COP to work out funding requirements  in consultation with the GEF was rejected. The matter will  be taken up by the Bureau.
