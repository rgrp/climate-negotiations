# SBSTA

## TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

On the development and transfer of  technologies, delegates considered the technology information  system, which includes an inventory of environmentally sound  technologies and a prototype web-based clearinghouse. SWITZERLAND  and the EU supported holding an expert meeting. The G-77/CHINA  encouraged continued funding. SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CHINA,  PERU and PANAMA, stressed the need for actual transfer of  technology in addition to information. Chair Dovland said informal  consultations would be held to prepare draft conclusions.

## METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Greenhouse gas inventories: Chair Dovland  recalled the SBSTA-12 invitation for Annex I submissions of  experiences in preparing greenhouse gas inventories using IPCC  good practice guidance. Noting that an expert inventory review  meeting is to take place in December 2001, he proposed deferring  evaluation of experiences to SBSTA-16.

###     Bunker fuels:

Taka Hiraishi, IPCC Inventories Task Force Bureau,  noted that the IPCC good practice guidance aims to complement the  revised 1996 IPCC greenhouse gas reporting guidelines and includes  a chapter on bunker fuels. The EU reiterated concerns about  increasing greenhouse gas emissions from international aviation  and called for guidelines compatible with the Protocol for  emissions allocation methodologies.  He urged the International  Maritime Organization (IMO) to work on emissions reductions  activities. SWITZERLAND proposed that the International Civil  Aviation Organization (ICAO) Council continue initiatives on  guidelines on emissions reductions. The G-77/CHINA proposed that  work take place within the framework of Protocol Article 2.2,  which stipulates that Annex I Parties shall limit emissions from  aviation and marine bunker fuels, working through the ICAO and  IMO. Informal consultations will be held.

###     Methods and tools to evaluate impacts and adaptation:

Noting the  complexity of methodologies, CANADA proposed that regional  workshops on integrated assessment include consideration of  impacts and adaptation. Supported by MALAYSIA, he suggested that  the technology information system also include impacts and  adaptation. MALAYSIA and THAILAND proposed joint research projects  between developed and developing countries. Chair Dovland said  informal consultations would be held.

###     Development of good practice guidance and other information for  the LULUCF sector:

IPCC Chair Bob Watson outlined the future of  the IPCC and highlighted the LULUCF work programme under the IPCC  National Greenhouse Gas Inventory programme, which focuses on:  good practice guidance; definitions for direct human-induced  degradation and devegetation, and inventory and reporting options;  and methodologies to factor out direct human-induced changes from  indirect human-induced changes and natural effects.

The EU, supported by INDONESIA, proposed that the SBSTA develop  terms of reference for IPCC work on CDM modalities for LULUCF  during its current session. The US, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, CANADA and  AUSTRALIA cautioned that the draft decision on LULUCF has yet to  be finalized. AOSIS stressed that issues related to Articles 5, 7  and 8 need to be resolved before further guidance is given to the  IPCC, and supported broader consultation. The matter will be  further examined in informal consultations.

###     Emissions from forest harvesting and wood products (HWP):

The EU  noted a proposal to develop approaches and methodologies  supporting the use of sustainably produced wood in replacing  energy intensive materials and fossil fuels. The EU, supported by  AOSIS, CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed the inclusion of HWP in the  first commitment period. NEW ZEALAND noted slow progress on the  development of technical methodologies and, supported by JAPAN,  CANADA and MALAYSIA, suggested further technical review. Informal  consultations will be held.

## POLICIES AND MEASURES

Noting a recent workshop on P&Ms, Chair  Dovland suggested that in-depth discussion be deferred to SBSTA- 16. After comments from Parties, he said he would produce brief  draft conclusions.

## COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The GLOBAL  CLIMATE OBSERVING SYSTEM (GCOS) reported on its regional workshop  programme and on a proposal for a second assessment of the  adequacy of observing systems. He noted concerns over  deterioration of existing networks and historical databases and  ongoing work to arrest this trend, as well as efforts to exploit  new observing methods. Several Parties expressed concern at the  deterioration of networks. The EU proposed inviting the GCOS  Secretariat to present an interim review of adequacy of networks,  addressing national activities, in time for consideration at  SBSTA-16. MALAYSIA suggested accessing GEF funds in this area.  Chair Dovland said informal consultations would be held to develop  draft conclusions on this matter.

On cooperation with other multilateral environmental agreements  (MEAs), the IPCC reported on its technical paper on interlinkages  between climate change, biodiversity and desertification, and on  the relevance of the Millennium Assessment to the climate change  process. The CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, CONVENTION TO  COMBAT DESERTIFICATION and RAMSAR CONVENTION ON WETLANDS outlined  linkages, synergies and collaborative activities between MEAs.  Regarding cooperation with other UN bodies, the WORLD HEALTH  ORGANIZATION reported on its work on human health and climate  change.

In the ensuing discussion, Parties stressed enhancing cooperation  between conventions, strenghtening such cooperation at the  national level, and furthering the international environmental  governance process. Chair Dovland indicated that an informal  contact group would be convened to develop draft conclusions.

# SBI

### LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

Delegates discussed how to move forward  in addressing: the establishment of an LDC expert group; support  for the preparation of National Adaptation Programmes of Action  (NAPAs); and guidance to the LDC fund. MALI, on behalf of the  LDCs, highlighted the need for terms of reference for the expert  group, and said his group is currently formulating proposals for a  draft decision on this matter. UNEP advocated a 'package' approach  involving NAPAs, the LDC expert group and the LDC Fund. Chair Ashe  indicated that a contact group would be established on this  matter.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

On the feasibility of developing  guidelines for the review of national communications, delegates  agreed to a proposal by Chair Ashe that this issue be considered  after the review of third national communications. On the review  and roster of experts in relation to third national  communications, Chair Ashe noted that these communications are due  by 30 November 2001, and said he would prepare draft decisions on  these matters.

### MATTERS REFERRED TO THE SBI BY THE COP

Report of the GEF: The SBI  considered the report of the GEF, with the G-77/CHINA highlighting  concerns over the length of time between project approval and  availability of funds, the impact of currency fluctuations, and  the need for adequate funding for support programmes. Chair Ashe  said he would produce draft conclusions.

###     Programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003:

UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Cutajar introduced the revised UNFCCC programme budget,  produced following SBI's recommendation at SB-14 of a budget for  2002-2003 of US$32.8 million. The US noted its position on the  Protocol and signaled its intention to reduce its share of funding  to the core budget so it does not contribute towards the  US$535,000 set out as a contingency in case of a 'prompt start' to  the CDM. Chair Ashe noted a number of instances where countries  stipulate specific activities for which their funding must not be  used. He indicated that consultations on a draft decision would be  held.

Addressing other matters, Chair Ashe noted that a draft decision  on late payments of contributions would be prepared following  informal consultations.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### MECHANISMS

Co-Chair Ra√∫l Estrada (Argentina) indicated that the  group, assisted by its two drafting groups, should complete its  work on Thursday, 1 November. He said CDM issues requiring  resolution to allow a 'prompt start' included election of members  of the Executive Board and budgetary issues. NIGERIA expressed  concerns over cross-cutting issues needing to be resolved,  including the eligibility requirement in relation to the  compliance system.

The EU, also speaking for the CG-11 and SWITZERLAND, introduced a  proposal on Article 6 (JI) containing appendices on standards for  accreditation of independent entities and on criteria for baseline  setting and monitoring, as well as several amendments to the draft  decisions (FCCC/CP/2001/MISC.5).

Delegates then heard a presentation from the Secretariat on  modalities under Article 7.4 (assigned amounts) focusing on the  elaboration of assigned amounts, registry requirements and the  compilation and accounting of emissions inventories and assigned  amounts.

The G-77/CHINA said the drafting groups should focus on technical  rather than high-level political issues. Co-Chair Kok Kee Chow  (Malaysia) suggested focusing on the establishment of registries,  starting with the CDM, but leaving the highly technical details to  the experts. Following the negotiating group meeting, the two  drafting groups convened in the evening to begin their work.

### COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Tuiloma Neroni Slade (Samoa) proposed working  on the basis of a Co-Chairs' non-paper on the status of  negotiations highlighting editorial changes as well as initial  agreement reached on text on the procedures and mechanisms  relating to compliance. JAPAN, also on behalf CANADA, the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION and AUSTRALIA, put forward a proposal for a draft COP  decision expressly deferring the issue of the nature of the  consequences to COP/MOP-1. The G-77/CHINA and the EU said  Ministers had agreed during COP-6 Part II that the consequences  would be binding and that only the mode of adoption had been  deferred to COP/MOP-1. The group then started consideration of the  Co-Chairs' non-paper, going through the sections on the preamble,  the objective, the Compliance Committee, the plenary of the  Committee and the facilitative branch. The Co-Chairs will hold  consultations on disputed paragraphs.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The first meeting of the negotiating  group on Articles 5, 7 and 8 began late evening. Delegates  discussed several issues raised by Chair Dovland, including expert  review teams and the standing group of review experts, and  supplementarity.

# INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

In addition to discussions in the negotiating groups, a number of  informal contact groups also held their first meetings to develop  draft conclusions or decisions for SBI and SBSTA on the review of  decisions concluded at COP-6 Part II, the Consultative Group of  Experts, and the budget.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates 'got down to business' Tuesday as negotiating groups  took up outstanding work left over from Bonn on compliance, the  mechanisms and Articles 5, 7 and 8. Participants seemed pleased  that some groups were already addressing substantive issues in a  productive way, even if some noted that it was too early to expect  significant movement, or to gauge overall progress, especially as  much of the detailed technical work will be taking place in  informal consultations.

In other news, a few delegates in informal drafting groups on JI  and the CDM expressed concern at what they saw as moves to apply  'double standards' to JI and CDM that could reopen 'old divisions'  on project review processes and environmental assessments. Others  dismissed such suggestions, noting that it was appropriate for  some differences to exist.
