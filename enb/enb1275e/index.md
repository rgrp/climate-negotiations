# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

Many developing country speakers, including EGYPT, ZAMBIA,  the PHILIPPINES, TOGO, MICRONESIA, ZIMBABWE, GAMBIA,  SWAZILAND, LESOTHO, GHANA, MYANMAR, SENEGAL, MAURITIUS,  MALAWI, CAMBODIA, ERITREA, SOLOMON ISLANDS, SUDAN, KENYA,  UGANDA, LAOS, MALTA, BHUTAN, PERU, VIET NAM, COTE D'IVOIRE,  KIRIBATI, ETHIOPIA and TUNISIA called on Annex I Parties to  commit to meaningful and prompt reduction targets. They  also, inter alia: highlighted the principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities; objected to commitments  for developing countries; and stressed that industrialized  countries have a moral obligation to take responsibility  for their historic emissions. Many noted that developing  countries are already implementing sustainable development  policies and objected to being labeled 'free riders.'  ETHIOPIA and SWAZILAND noted poverty eradication as a  developing country priority. SINGAPORE noted its emissions  will increase as its economy and population grows.

Other speakers, such as KAZAKHSTAN, NIGER, VIET NAM,  KIRIBATI, EGYPT, JORDAN, LEBANON, ECUADOR, URUGUAY,  LESOTHO, KENYA, BAHRAIN, TURKMENISTAN and SLOVENIA  recounted the effects of climate change and national  efforts to address these problems and lower GHG emissions.  BHUTAN noted its effort to maintain its forests as carbon  sinks. FIJI stated that island states would experience the  worse effects of climate change. CUBA noted that even under  an unfair economic blockade it has taken action on climate  change as a small island developing country.

Many countries, including KAZAKHSTAN, EGYPT, ZIMBABWE,  ZAMBIA, MALAWI, CAMBODIA, SOLOMON ISLANDS, LAOS, URUGUAY,  VIET NAM, GAMBIA, KENYA, TUNISIA, MYANMAR, NIGER, UGANDA,  MOROCCO, LESOTHO, SWAZILAND emphasized the need for  technology transfer, financial resources and capacity  building to address climate change. Some countries, such as  PERU, CHILE and COLOMBIA, supported a clean development  fund. BELGIUM called for a more equitable way of sharing  technologies between North and South.

LATVIA said Annex I countries should lead the process of  GHG reduction, but developing countries should demonstrate  the political will to follow. SLOVAKIA agreed to commit to  reductions even if its economy is not highly developed.  ESTONIA said advanced developing countries should begin  adopting some commitments. THAILAND supported dividing  developing countries into two groups with different  timeframes for reaching targets while calling for support  and leadership from developed countries. AZERBAIJAN,  ARMENIA and CROATIA said difficulties in the transition to  a market economy should be taken into account.

AUSTRIA and ITALY described their target within the EU  proposal. AUSTRIA said the number of outstanding issues  underscores the need for a follow-up process. ITALY  highlighted domestic increases in renewable energy  investments. FINLAND highlighted its actions on climate  change and called national actions the most critical.  IRELAND noted that its indicative emissions target for 2010  represents a 15% increase over 1990 levels rather than the  55% increase that would be realized otherwise. The CZECH  REPUBLIC and MONACO supported the EU's targets and policies  and measures for achieving them.

KAZAKHSTAN, SLOVENIA, LATVIA and ESTONIA supported  emissions trading but emphasized strong monitoring and  compliance mechanisms. POLAND called for a budget approach  to allow countries that reduce emissions before 2000 to  bank those credits against later emissions. MALAWI,  URUGUAY, ETHIOPIA, COLOMBIA and ROMANIA welcomed activities  implemented jointly (AIJ). CAMBODIA said emissions trading  and joint implementation (JI) could be useful if focused on  clean technology dissemination. The PHILIPPINES cautioned  against using sinks, emissions trading and JI.

TURKEY said it is not able to be a Party to the FCCC, due  to unfair social and economic burdens stemming from being  included in both annexes.

The UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, YEMEN and GAMBIA supported a  compensation mechanism for countries that suffer economic  losses under the Convention. GAMBIA and YEMEN called for  more enhanced and effective support from the GEF. ALGERIA  called for simplified procedures for disbursing assets for  priority needs of developing countries.

Delegates also heard statements from the IPCC, GEF, IEA,  GLOBE International, World Business Council for Sustainable  Development, Climate Action Network-South East Asia, OPEC,  UNDP, US Climate Action Network, Japan Federation of  Economic Organizations International (Keidanren), Business  Council for Sustainable Energy, International Youth  Movement for the UN, IOC, International Confederation of  Free Trade Unions, the Climate Train, World Council of  Churches, International Federation of Chemical, Energy,  Mine and General Workers' Unions, the World Food Programme,  Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development, the Permanent Commission of the South  Pacific, SPREP and the UN Economic and Social Commission  for Asia and the Pacific.

# COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

Chair Raul Estrada introduced a new draft text  (FCCC/CP/1997/CRP.4) at an early evening session of the  COW, with recommendations from a number of negotiations  including those on Article 3 (QELROs).

He indicated that the proposed text on Article 3 would be  treated as a take it or leave it 'kind of offer' and he  would allow time for delegations to acquaint themselves  with the content and consult. The QELROs proposal was the  global bubble as suggested at different moments during the  negotiations, in particular by Russia. The Chair's text  contains a proposal amounting to a global reduction of 5  per cent in emissions of CO2, CH4, NO2 from 1990 levels,  for the commitment period between 2006 and 2010, with the  possibility that Parties fulfil the commitment individually  or jointly. It is expected that COP-4 will adopt an annex  to the Protocol establishing reduction comitments covering  HFCs, PFCs, and SF6 with commitment linkage between the two  baskets. He said the global reduction commitment had been  distributed in a differentiated way, with some countries  possibly increasing emissions, others keeping their current  levels, and most reducing. Afforestation, reforestation and  deforestation had been included as sinks, with provision  for further analysis. The text for draft Article 6 on  emissions trading was negotiated at AGBM-8 in Bonn. On  Article 7, Chair Estrada said joint implementation between  Annex I and non-Annex I Parties had been dropped. Draft  Article 10 on voluntary commitments by non-Annex I Parties  remains by default as presented after AGBM-8.

Chair Estrada said the proposed Clean Development Mechanism  (CDM) had evolved in such a way that it now deserved  separate treatment in the new Article 14. He invited  Parties to read the text with care. The Chair of a working  group on Article 12 dealing with the relationship between  the protocol and FCCC Article 4.1, Bo Kjell√©n (Sweden),  said he was prepared to recommence negotiations on  outstanding issues, hopeful that resolution of related text  on policies and measures and on finance would help.

The Chair of the working group on Article 14, Luis Gylvan  Meira Filho, said he had introduced a bracket free text as  time restraints had not allowed his group to complete its  work. Chair Estrada suggested consultation with the legal  drafting group. URUGUAY sought clarification on provision  in Article 14 for Annex I Parties to use certificates of  reductions accruing from CDM projects to contribute to  compliance 'with part of their' QELROs commitments. Meira  Filho said there had been no full agreement on the text  because a number of delegations thought that either a  number should be specified in the text as a percentage of  commitments or that the COP should determine a percentage  representing a maximum of commitments that could be met  using the CDM. Others preferred a more general restriction.  SAUDI ARABIA objected that an alternative text from Chair  Estrada's negotiating text had been dropped. Chair Estrada  said it was clear that the draft Article 14 did not reflect  a consensus.

Chair Estrada said the article on compliance is the softer  of the two available options. On entry into force, he chose  the threshold of 60 ratifications, incorporating Annex I  Parties which account in total for at least 60% of the  total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990 of Annex Parties.  He explained that 60 percent was just outside the limit of  giving a veto to one Party. The biggest emitter within the  group is responsible for 34 percent.

BURKINA FASO, supported by BANGLADESH and UGANDA, called  for a reference to an FCCC provision on taking full account  of the situations of the least developed countries in  Article 3. MAURITANIA said the Burkina Faso concern had  been addressed in draft Article 2. IRAN said Parties should  not make Chair Estrada's job more difficult by making  issues complicated. Chair Estrada said it was clear that  one group wanted a reference to FCCC Article 4.9 and  another did not. He invited Iran to consult with Burkina  Faso. KUWAIT suggested adjourning the meeting. MAURITANIA  said he would assume that OPEC countries were opposed to  their inclusion among the least developed countries. He  asked if that was the position indicated by Iran, Kuwait  and Nigeria in their interventions. NIGERIA described  Mauritania's intervention as undiplomatic. He invited  Mauritania to submit a fresh proposal on incorporating a  reference to FCCC Article 4.9. The G-77/CHINA said  delegations had just heard a display of the group's unity  in diversity and the transparent way in which the group  conducted its business. He offered to take up the question  within the group. MAURITANIA apologized and welcomed  Nigerian support for including a reference to least  developed countries. Chair Estrada said he saw no  objection. The meeting was suspended.

The COW resumed at 3:20 am Wednesday. Chair Estrada said  intense negotiations and consultations had been conducted  within and between groups since the draft protocol text had  been circulated earlier. He said he expected a positive end  to negotiations, but there were still some points to  settle.

He highlighted areas needing discussion in Article 3 on  QELROs. He said questions had been raised whether the  global five percent reduction commitment could be  understood as the responsibility of each Annex I Party. He  said the text needed refinement to indicate that each Party  would be responsible for its respective number in Annex A.

He noted a real possibility to reach agreement on covering  six gases from the beginning, rather than the 'three plus  three' approach. Different wording would be needed,  particularly regarding base years for each group of gases:  1990 for CO2, CH4 and NO2; and 1995 in some cases for other  gases. He said this required careful drafting to provide  the necessary transparency.

He said there were some proposals to change the commitment  period, 2006-2010, in the draft. The G-77/CHINA and other  countries prefer to begin as soon as possible. Others are  reluctant to start before 2008.

He said everybody agrees that the questions on Article 3  need to be solved to solve the rest. He noted ongoing  negotiations and telephone calls to capitols, and proposed  delaying discussion until later in the day. He also asked  delegates to devote some thinking to Article 12 on existing  commitments under Article 4.1.

BRAZIL said he hoped a reopened discussion on sinks would  only address baselines, and that he would not agree to  including all managed sinks in QELROs. Chair Estrada said  sinks are not a matter to be discussed.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates indicated that a number of major issues were  still in play after the adjournment of the COW early  Wednesday. A revised sinks text was reportedly circulating.  Several delegations suggested they were not yet ready to  accept the quantified emission limitation and reduction  commitment in the Chair's draft Annex A, which put the EU  at -8 percent, the US, Russia, Canada and Ukraine at -5  percent, Japan at -4.5 percent, New Zealand even, Australia  and Norway at +5 percent, and Iceland +10 percent compared  to 1990 levels. Delegates are also thought to be re- crafting the proposal on evolution, a follow-up to New  Zealand's bid to get developing countries on board.
