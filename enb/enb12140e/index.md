# PROJECT-BASED ACTIVITIES

### IPCC OVERVIEW

Presentations: IPCC Chair Bob Watson said  the first question relating to project-based activities was  whether or not to include sinks in the CDM and, if they are  included, which ones to allow. Sandra Brown, IPCC Lead  Author, provided information on, inter alia: development of  baselines, which can be project-specific or generic, and  fixed or regularly updated; approaches to accounting for  and mitigation of leakage; permanence; and measuring,  monitoring and verification of selected pools. Watson noted  that these issues must also be addressed in energy  projects, while observing that the question of permanence  is considered more difficult for LULUCF projects.

Question-and-answer session: In the ensuing question-and- answer session, the EUROPEAN COMMISSION drew attention to  the possibility of leakage having positive effects. In  response to a question on leakage by the NETHERLANDS,  Sandra Brown highlighted the development of 'look-up  tables' for leakages covering different types of tree  species and based on market supply and demand. The US  underscored the distinction between the cost and price of  carbon, and said there may be opportunities to sell at a  significant profit. Brown stressed the current lack of a  price, since there is no market and the only information  available is on investment costs.

In response to a question by the US on baselines, Brown  said baselines in some existing projects are now being  revisited to add field data. She noted that, with more  projects, there will be added incentive and data to develop  generic baselines. CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC queried what  could be done to monitor small-scale projects in rural  areas, and Brown said it was a question of encouraging  cooperation at a local level, after which standard  statistical sampling could be used. With regard to a  possible minimum area size or carbon offset, she said  several small projects could be bundled into larger ones.

FINLAND drew attention to the complexity of the underlying  causes of deforestation, highlighting structural and socio- economic factors, and questioned how much a project  approach would actually address the wider problem of  deforestation. Watson replied that, while it is important  to identify the root cause and to change policy and  institutional frameworks, projects could be of value and  are the only feasible approach under the climate change  framework.

In response to a comment by the UK on the possibility of  using sectoral baselines, Watson said this could be a  viable option, although it required careful consideration.  AOSIS noted the potential benefits of projects for  indigenous peoples.

### PRESENTATIONS

Following the IPCC overview and question- and-answer session, participants heard presentations from  representatives of Parties, NGOs and the business sector.

NGO and business presentations: Igino Emmer, Consultant,  FACE Foundation, presented on the design and management of  reforestation projects, outlining the Foundation's  portfolio of reforestation projects to sequester CO2. He  emphasized the benefits of certification and verification  of forest management projects and called for development of  sound monitoring programmes.

Gareth Phillips, Société Générale de Surveillance (SGS),  outlined early experiences with verification of land-based  projects. Highlighting the importance of eligibility, he  said SGS has developed its own carbon offset verification  scheme, including acceptability, additionality,  externalities, and capacity. He suggested that a number of  potential JI/CDM projects exist, and said these will need  to overcome challenges relating to, inter alia: eligibility  criteria; accounting methodology; and defining  rules/guidance on baselines. He recommended using average  carbon capacity for calculating stock changes.

Ken MacDicken, Director of Research, Center for  International Forestry Research, presented on the  opportunities for rural livelihoods under CDM forestry  projects. He highlighted the dual purposes of the CDM and  outlined potential benefits and risk associated with these  projects. He emphasized the importance of undertaking  social impact assessments. He highlighted the need for,  inter alia: incentives for multiple benefits; the inclusion  of a broad range of LULUCF options under the CDM; a  reduction in transaction costs; the approval of tonne-year  accounting; and strengthening of local capacities. He  concluded that livelihood issues are not a reason to  exclude LULUCF from CDM and that rulemaking can increase  the probability of positive impacts.

Bill Hare, Climate Policy Director, Greenpeace  International, spoke on land-use change and forestry  activities under the CDM. He opposed inclusion of these  activities, stressing problems related to: climate change  mitigation, as every tonne of CO2 sequestered permits an  additional tonne of emissions; the sustainable development  criterion and its lack of positive impacts on social and  equity issues and technological development; and a likely  over-estimation of forest conservation and biodiversity  protection due to leakage and a focus on inexpensive  sequestration projects.

Party presentations: Sergio Jauregui, Advisor on LULUCF and  Climate Change, Bolivian Vice Ministry of Environment,  spoke on the Noel Kemmpff Mercado Climate Action Project in  Bolivia. He highlighted the two components of emissions  reduction: eliminating logging, and eliminating conversion  of forest to agricultural land. He said the project  addresses leakage by providing alternative economic  opportunities for the affected communities. It also  addresses the issue of permanence by: assimilating the area  indefinitely into a national park; controlling fires;  including local communities in park management; and  discouraging migration by providing key infrastructure for  the local population.

Ken Andrasko, Office of Atmospheric Programs, US  Environmental Protection Agency, outlined US views on  project-based LULUCF activities. He noted the importance of  LULUCF in the global carbon cycle, the fact that projects  could be widely distributed internationally, and the  potential for co-benefits that may be larger than the  carbon benefit. He argued that the potential problems of  additionality, leakage and permanence should be addressed  through appropriate rules and project design.

Question-and-answer session: In the ensuing question-and- answer session, GERMANY asked whether the prospect of  carbon credits for emissions avoidance - such as prevention  of planned deforestation - could act as an incentive for  deforestation activities. In response, Sergio Jauregui said  this was not a problem in Bolivia, where deforestation is  primarily due to socio-economic reasons, and where most  people involved in deforestation would not be aware of the  Kyoto Protocol or carbon credits. He said any attempts to  manipulate the credit system would be identified at the  accreditation stage.

In response to a question from SWITZERLAND on how  compatible Greenpeace's opposition to LULUCF projects under  the CDM is with the objectives of the Protocol, Bill Hare  noted that LULUCF carbon credits would not be an  appropriate means of achieving stable atmospheric  concentrations of CO2, given questions of permanence and  additionality, and said that, based on current scientific  knowledge, emissions reductions were a safer way to  proceed. He also suggested that the Protocol was not  necessarily the most suitable context for addressing in- depth forest management issues. Responding to comments on  how best to move forward, Ken Andrasko said the US  supported working in parallel on the key issues rather than  addressing one after the other.

NIGERIA questioned whether developing countries would  benefit from sinks projects under the CDM, and emphasized  the need for social impact assessment of projects' long- term implications. Bill Hare suggested that Parties only  consider renewable energy projects under the CDM.

MEXICO commented on the importance of co-benefits in sinks  projects. Ken MacDicken agreed, suggesting harmonization of  projects with co-benefit elements from the CBD and GEF  programmes. AUSTRIA underscored the risks of increased  forest losses due to perverse incentives. In response,  Gareth Phillips said that clear guidelines are necessary to  avoid potential deforestation arising from perverse  incentives. Responding to a question from SENEGAL on  baselines in Bolivia, Sergio Jauregui said the baseline  assumes that: logging companies continue to exploit and  farmers continue slash and burn practices; parameters are  dependent on the rate of logging of nearby forest  concessions and historical land-use trends established by  communities; and carbon monitoring relies on satellite  data, data from nearby logging concessions, and permanent  plots. AUSTRALIA queried the lack of carbon projects in  degraded land areas in Africa. Ken MacDicken responded that  restoring degraded savannah lands using sinks projects  would require the transfer of sophisticated technology to  resolve the problem of water constraints.

# GENERAL ACCOUNTING, VERIFICATION AND REPORTING ISSUES

Workshop Co-Chair Thorgeirsson introduced this topic,  noting that accounting, verification and reporting  represent the backbone of LULUCF activities.

### IPCC OVERVIEW

Ian Noble, IPCC Lead Author, noted that the  Special Report had addressed issues of accounting,  verification and reporting. He stated that the Revised 1996  Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories were  devised for the purposes of the FCCC rather than the  Protocol, and said an elaboration will be needed. Co-Chair  Thorgeirsson highlighted the importance of distinguishing  between what broad decisions need to be taken by COP-6, and  what issues can be dealt with at a later stage.

### PRESENTATIONS

Thomas Häusler, Remote Sensing Expert from  the Company for Applied Remote Sensing (GAF), presented on  earth observation in the context of LULUCF applications. He  highlighted, inter alia, the reliability and cost benefits  of using remote sensing to provide data for forest  inventories and to monitor afforestation, reforestation and  deforestation at frequent intervals. He stressed the need  for a standardized nomenclature and harmonized technical  procedures. He noted, however, that remote sensing cannot  be used to measure carbon stocks, and suggested the use of  appropriate indicators.

Ian Carruthers, Australian Greenhouse Office, made a  presentation outlining Australia's perspective on carbon  accounting for LULUCF. He said land areas would enter into  an accounting system for Article 3.3 and 3.4 once eligible  LULUCF activities were established on that land. He  suggested that, once the land area entered into the  accounting framework, all changes in greenhouse gases and  carbon stocks from all relevant pools should be included,  and the land should remain within the system into future  commitment periods. He expressed a preference for a narrow  approach to the selection of activities and land-based  accounting. He drew attention to Australia's work on  developing a national carbon accounting system, which he  said could be applicable to other countries.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### GENERAL ACCOUNTING, VERIFICATION AND REPORTING ISSUES

Participants will resume consideration of this matter at  9:00 am.

### KEY ISSUES

Once discussion of general accounting,  verification and reporting issues has concluded, it is  expected that a session will be held drawing together  important issues that have emerged during this workshop.  The Co-Chairs will then present their conclusions on the  workshop, and are expected to close the meeting late  afternoon.
