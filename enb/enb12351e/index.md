The AWG agreed on text requesting the Secretariat to organize the AWG meetings in conjunction with other meetings and activities under the Convention and Protocol. AWG Chair Charles indicated he would continue informal consultations and reconvene the AWG plenary in the coming days. Outstanding issues included whether to reference paragraph numbers in the report from the first part of AWG 4, or to insert language on the need for global emissions to peak within 10-15 years and be reduced to well below half of 2000 levels by the middle of the century; and on the 25-40% indicative range of emissions reductions by 2020. In addition, some of the AWG tasks for its sixth, seventh and eighth sessions remained in brackets. Delegates approved the draft outline of the report (FCCC/KP/AWG/2007/L.5).

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS SECOND REVIEW OF THE PROTOCOL UNDER ARTICLE 9

## SCOPE AND CONTENT:

The group met informally in the morning and in a contact group in the afternoon. Disagreements remained on a number of issues, including: whether the aim of the review should be the implementation or the effectiveness of the Protocol; linkages of the review with the AWG; compliance under the Protocol; procedures for amending the annexes to the Protocol; the elaboration of an information note by the Secretariat on the AWG work; and an intersessional workshop.

## LONG-TERM COOPERATIVE ACTION UNDER THE CONVENTION:

Co-Facilitators Bamsey and De Wet reconvened informal discussions. On the process, parties discussed options in the draft decision and proposals for: a negotiating or intergovernmental negotiating committee; informal consultations; and synchronizing meetings with the AWG process. On inputs to the work programme, parties considered a two-track approach, opposition to references to inputs/outputs from processes such as the G8, the AWG, the IPCC and Article 9 review of the Protocol. Co-Facilitator Bamsey explained that the COP President would convene a group on Wednesday to finalize a decision. On Tuesday afternoon, a revised draft text was issued. The revised draft no longer includes an annex with a list of activities. It describes the process, replaces a reference to objectives with quantified national emission limitation and reduction commitments, and reorganizes sections containing operative paragraphs under the themes of the four building blocks. The decision states that the process should begin without delay, with a first meeting in March 2008. Negotiations reconvened in the evening. One party introduced three paragraphs based on the UNFCCC and citing per capita emissions. On mitigation, a number of alternative paragraphs were proposed. The Co-Facilitators invited parties to form a small drafting group, which worked late into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Even as veterans of the process were enjoying a series of celebrations to mark the Kyoto Protocol tenth anniversary on Tuesday, observers were detecting a shift in the tone of some negotiating groups. As the SBI and SBSTA concluded their work late in the night, some were already casting blame for the apparent failure of talks on technology transfer, with anger and dismay evident among many parties. A few wondered if a deal might still somehow be salvaged later, however. Meanwhile, informal discussions on the critical post-2012 process were also viewed by some as less positive, with observers noting some difficult talks of increasing complexity under the Convention track. I don t know where this will take us, but the clock is now ticking down to Friday, noted one.
