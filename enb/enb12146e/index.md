# INFORMAL MEETINGS

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

On 8 September, delegates completed  discussions on the Co-Chairs' draft negotiating text.  Several Annex I countries, opposed by some developing  countries, suggested deleting a paragraph on actions  related to policy options. AOSIS presented alternative text  for this section, suggesting the deletion of the paragraph.  UGANDA said those supporting its deletion were avoiding  commitment. SAUDI ARABIA stressed the importance of  assisting economic diversification in oil-exporting  developing countries, and supported tax restructuring in  Annex I Parties. With LIBYA, QATAR and VENEZUELA, he  supported discouraging fossil fuel production in Annex I  countries. LIBYA underscored the externalities of nuclear  energy. On the preamble, SAUDI ARABIA suggested separating  it between two decisions, one on FCCC Article 4.8 and  Article 4.9, the other on Protocol Article 3.14. A revised  Co-Chairs' text will be available Monday.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

On 8 September, delegates  completed discussions on the guidelines under Article 7.  The EU, opposed by the US, questioned the need for the  section on reporting on domestic enforcement. SAUDI ARABIA,  for the G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU, suggested new  headings on information related to transfer of technology  and additional financial resources, and highlighted their  textual proposal on information on implementation of  Protocol Article 3.14. NEW ZEALAND proposed a new heading  on issuance and cancellation of assigned amounts under  Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4. The group then continued  discussion on the draft guidelines on Article 8.

On 9 September, Parties continued deliberations on Part I  of the guidelines under Article 8. The G-77/CHINA bracketed  most of the text, citing insufficient time to consider it.  The Secretariat distributed new versions of the guidelines  under Article 7 and of Part II of the guidelines under  Article 8, which had been prepared by a small drafting  group. The Secretariat distributed draft decisions on  national systems under Article 5.1, methodologies for  adjustments under Article 5.2, and guidelines under  Articles 7 and 8.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Economies in Transition (EITs): On 8  September, participants considered the revised paper on  possible elements of a draft framework for capacity  building in EITs. Participants gave their initial comments  on the Purposes, Objective and Scope and Implementation  parts of the framework.

Participants highlighted the need for, inter alia: the  framework to provide a clear basis for action; a results- based approach to capacity building to ensure its  effectiveness; consideration of past and present  activities; elaboration of mutual responsibilities; and  consistency between any additional reporting obligations  with the guidelines of national communications. HUNGARY,  for the EITs, noted the importance of defining a timeframe  and emphasized the need for an early start to capacity  building.

Non-Annex I Countries: On 8 September, participants  discussed the draft elements for a framework on capacity  building in developing countries, and considered a revision  of the text on 9 September.

Issues raised included the need to: mobilize regional and  sub-regional institutions; strengthen existing  institutions; provide good guidance to the GEF; and take  into account past actions and develop coherence with  present activities in order to define activities that will  support FCCC implementation.

AOSIS said capacity building is a dynamic and iterative  process that will be augmented by experiences from  implementing other aspects of the FCCC. She said the needs  assessment should not be used as an excuse to delay action  on those needs that have already been identified. Delegates  diverged over whether to delete language on synergies with  other global environmental agreements and the reference to  the requirement that capacity building activities be  results-based and implemented in a programmatic manner.

Chair Ashe said a report on the informal group's meetings  would be presented at SB-13 and a contact group would be  set up to prepare a draft decision to which the framework  would be annexed.

### LULUCF

On 8 September, delegates discussed key areas of  contention as identified by the Co-Chairs based on  discussions related to the consolidated synthesis of Party  submissions on LULUCF. On separation of natural versus  human-induced effects, SWITZERLAND, opposed by CANADA,  supported a negotiated threshold to deal with the human- induced effects, which could also be adjusted to deal with  issues of uncertainty and permanence.

On eligibility of Article 3.4 activities, TUVALU drew  attention to the insufficiency of existing data, suggesting  it would be difficult to base a sound decision on such  data. On limitation of debits and credits of additional  activities, the US supported using a threshold, opposed  using a cap, and said a possible phase-in approach should  provide incentives to take action. On aggregation- degradation, AUSTRALIA said the issue was not a priority,  and said he could support a process decision at COP-6.

On 9 September, Co-Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the new  Co-Chairs' text on elements related to Article 3.3 and 3.4  that would be the basis for deliberations during SB-13.

### MECHANISMS

On 8-9 September, Parties considered text on  guidelines for implementing Protocol Article 6 (JI), and  the draft decision on Article 12 (CDM). On the COP/MOP,  JAPAN, CANADA, the US and POLAND reiterated a preference  for existing Article 6 provisions. The G-77/CHINA urged the  same rigor for JI as for CDM. On participation, the EU  outlined its two-track approach. The US and NORWAY  expressed interest in the proposal, with caveats. On  monitoring, the EU, supported by several Annex I countries,  proposed an option consistent with its two-track approach.  SAUDI ARABIA, supported by CANADA, bracketed reference to  the CDM Reference Manual.

On supplementarity, the EU, G-77/CHINA and HUNGARY  emphasized domestic action as the primary means to fulfill  commitments. SAUDI ARABIA, with the AFRICA GROUP, suggested  a cap of 25-30%. The EU elaborated on two formulae: for a  ceiling on net transfers and for a ceiling on net  acquisitions. The US and CANADA emphasized concerns with  quantitative caps.

On an interim CDM, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, and NORWAY  underlined the need for a prompt start. SAUDI ARABIA  highlighted legal difficulties with a prompt start, and  suggested expanding the AIJ pilot phase to accommodate  this. The EU and SWITZERLAND said the CDM should commence  immediately after COP-6 on a permanent rather than interim  basis. The AFRICA GROUP proposed a stand-alone decision on  interim arrangements. Parties differed on the use of a  positive list of CDM projects. BOLIVIA and CANADA  emphasized inclusion of LULUCF in the CDM.

### COMPLIANCE

On 8 September, Parties continued discussions  on the Co-Chairs' text. On proceedings of the compliance  committee, the G-77/CHINA said procedures relating to  decision-making, participation, conflict of interest and  information sources should be equally applicable to both  branches. The US suggested having two separate and complete  procedures. SAMOA and the US said the enforcement branch  could address specific provisions and the facilitation  branch could have broad jurisdiction. BRAZIL, opposed by  AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported  distinguishing between facilitation available to Annex I  and non-Annex I Parties. NEW ZEALAND proposed an appeal  system. The US retained the option of no appeal procedure.  With BRAZIL, she said any appeal body should be limited to  overriding decisions. SAUDI ARABIA suggested the COP/MOP be  the appeals body.

On 9 September, Parties discussed outcomes and consequences  of non-compliance and adoption. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by  the US, NEW ZEALAND and AUSTRALIA, suggested  differentiating between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.  Parties disagreed on whether the facilitative branch should  be able to publish non-compliance or potential non- compliance, initiate the enforcement procedure and issue  cautions. AUSTRALIA, with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and  opposed by SAMOA, PALAU, the FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA  and BRAZIL, argued against binding consequences.

On Adoption, the US outlined three options: the COP  recommends to the COP/MOP that the attached decision be  adopted; the COP recommends to the COP/MOP that the  attached decision be included in the decision on the second  commitment period; or the COP adopts a legal instrument  that enters into force at the same time as the Protocol.  The EU, opposed by AUSTRALIA, stressed the link between  adoption and use of the mechanisms. A new text will be  available Monday.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

This informal group met on 8 and 9  September to consider draft text on a framework for action  to implement technology transfer under the FCCC. On  capacity building, some participants stressed the need to  avoid duplication of matters being addressed elsewhere and  to enhance the capacity of existing institutions. The US  said capacity building for the identification of CDM  projects could maximize their use for technology transfer.

On mechanisms for technology transfer, participants  discussed the GEF's role, whether to establish an  intergovernmental technical advisory panel and a funding  mechanism for technology transfer, and the need for  integrated approaches. Several participants said ODA should  not be used for technology transfer, as this would be a  distortion of development priorities. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA  noted that the discussion focused mainly on the demand side  of technology transfer and stressed the need to examine the  supply of technology. The GEF noted that existing  programmes, such as the Medium-Sized Projects, could be  used as a means for transferring technology. A revised Co- Chairs' text will be available Monday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The week-long informal meetings ended with a number of  participants expressing concern over slow progress on most  issues, given the limited time for COP-6 preparation.

The informal week also witnessed the formation of a new  negotiating group, the 'Environmental Integrity Group,'  which includes Switzerland, the Republic of Korea and  Mexico. The aim of the group is to ensure that its members  can participate in smaller group negotiations likely to  take place during critical eleventh hour talks at COP-6.  Observers are taking a 'wait and see' approach regarding  the possible impact of the new grouping.

This news coincided with Vanuatu's announcement that the  LDCs will take group positions on issues such as FCCC  Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects). Some suggest that  this reflects the predictable divergence of interests and  priorities among sub-groups within the G-77/China, readily  apparent during the informals.
