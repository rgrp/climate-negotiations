# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

Ryutaro Hashimoto, Prime Minister of Japan, urged developed  countries to agree on meaningful, realistic and equitable  emissions reduction targets that are legally binding. He  called on all Parties, including developing countries, to  voluntarily enhance their measures. He disagreed with the  idea that strict rules adversely affect the economy, and  noted they could trigger innovation, promote capital  investment and give rise to new industry.

José María Figueres Olsen, President of Costa Rica, said  the Kyoto agreement must include significant cuts in  emissions by the industrialized countries, a financial  mechanism bridging developed and developing countries, and  active voluntary participation by the developing nations.  He noted that Costa Rica has developed a marketable  instrument that will value emission reductions. He also  called on developing countries to do their part.

Kinza Clodumar, President of Nauru, called the willful  destruction of small island states with foreknowledge an  'unspeakable crime against humanity.' He said solving the  problem requires more than stabilization of GHGs. He noted  US President Clinton's pledge for significant future  reductions and called for an announcement on this from Vice  President Gore.

Albert Gore Jr., US Vice President, said realistic binding  emissions limits would create new markets for technologies  to ameliorate the problem. He reiterated the US commitment  to reduce emissions by 30% of projected levels by 2010 and  key elements of the US proposal. He announced increased US  flexibility for working towards a commitment with realistic  targets and timetables, market mechanisms, and  participation of key developing countries.

Maurice Strong, Under-Secretary General and Executive  Coordinator for UN Reform, delivered a statement for UN  Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He said many would be  disappointed that the Kyoto agreement would be a modest  step. But the very fact that legally binding targets and  timetables were in prospect showed how far the community of  nations had come in taking responsibility.

COP President Hiroshi Ohki (Japan) reported substantial  progress at the intensive discussions in Kyoto and  expressed confidence about a breakthrough for final  agreement. He called on ministers to bring political will  to the objective of getting developed countries to take the  lead.

FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar commented  on the remarkable nature of the Conference given the media  interest and the scale of the UN Internet broadcast, which  have focused world attention on Kyoto. He said the zen  practice of breaking through mental boundaries provided a  good theme for the days ahead when negotiators would have  to break through the tendency to consider the short-term  costs while neglecting the long -term economic  opportunities.

For the G-77/CHINA, Bakari Mbonde (Tanzania) said decisive  action would be needed to strengthen developed country  obligations. He underlined the Berlin Mandate to achieve  QELROs and advance implementation of commitments under  Article 4.1 without new commitments for developing country  parties. Developing countries had undertaken their own  measures and the success of these was predicated on Annex I  country fulfillment of their commitments including transfer  of technology. He rejected offshore extra-territorial  implementation of targets and welcomed the clean  development fund initiative.

The EU rejected differentiation that makes targets weaker.  Instead, it must guarantee comparable commitments for major  economies at least. Flexibility resulting in  environmentally detrimental loopholes is unacceptable. He  supported: the 'three plus three' gas proposal; trading  only with strong targets and domestic action, monitoring,  sanctions and market safeguards; and JI with rules and  safeguards. He said mandatory internationally coordinated  P&Ms are indispensable. Suggestions that developing  countries should take up new commitments are not helpful to  negotiations and are contrary to the Berlin Mandate.  Mobilizing new and additional resources through the  financial mechanism could foster voluntary limitation of  developing country GHG emissions.

Many speakers focused on elements necessary for a Kyoto  agreement. SAMOA, for AOSIS and supported by NIUE, stated  that a Kyoto agreement must contain strong, short- and  medium-term targets for Annex I Parties and a mechanism for  early review of their adequacy. NORWAY said developed  countries must agree on an overall reduction target for the  emission of all GHGs of 10 to 15% by 2010. A flat rate  approach fails in fairness and effectiveness, and renders  an ambitious agreement impossible. SOUTH AFRICA supported  the EU-proposed targets.

Many speakers, such as IRAN, INDIA, BANGLADESH, VENEZUELA,  KOREA, INDONESIA, MALAYSIA, MALDIVES, CHINA, PARAGUAY,  SEYCHELLES and BARBADOS on behalf of Caribbean Community,  opposed any new commitments for developing countries since  developed nations had not met their existing commitments.  Many described national actions already underway. CHINA  said it could not undertake reduction commitments because  its main priority is development. MEXICO is taking on  responsibilities and will continue to do so regardless of  the outcome in Kyoto.

JAPAN sought voluntary commitments for more advanced  developing countries and a process to review commitments by  all Parties. ARGENTINA called for binding commitments for  Annex I Parties and differentiated targets. RUSSIA declared  its intention to turn quantitative commitments into  practice jointly with all other countries whose interests  are restrained by the concept of partial differentiation.

AUSTRALIA said the agreement must include sources, sinks  and criteria for differentiation. CANADA proposed  reductions of 3% for the period 2008 - 2012 and 5% by 2013  - 2017. She noted that developing countries' emissions are  growing and supported the sequencing of obligations of  developing countries. NEW ZEALAND stated that a target for  Annex I Parties of 5% below 1990 levels is achievable  within a decade and that many reduction measures are not  available to less heavily industrialized countries.

Some delegations, such as INDIA, SYRIA, MOLDOVA, BOLIVIA,  PAPUA NEW GUINEA, HONDURAS, NIGERIA, PAKISTAN and BOTSWANA  stressed that developing countries' capacities have to be  enhanced through the transfer of technology and financial  resources. The UK noted the possible economic benefits of  measures such as improved transport, housing, energy  efficiency and environmental technology. AUSTRALIA  highlighted the need to develop and market energy-efficient  technologies. MOZAMBIQUE said pollution permit trading  could help technology transfer.

Other speakers offered differing views on flexibility  mechanisms. SWITZERLAND and NORWAY supported joint  implementation (JI) once modalities are agreed, but  developed countries should not circumvent reduction  objectives. RUSSIA said JI and emissions trading could  foster partnership between developed and developing  nations. CANADA said flexibility is needed to adjust to  changes required for implementation and cost-effective  reductions.

VENEZUELA, CHINA and INDONESIA objected to emissions  trading. FRANCE said flexibility alternatives should not be  used until quantifiable reductions have been achieved.  ARGENTINA, UZBEKISTAN and LITHUANIA supported JI as useful  to access environmentally sound technologies. DENMARK said  trading offers no end of possibilities for fraud and 'hot  air' trading should not be allowed. BRAZIL called for  further consideration of emission trading permits between  developed countries.

Ministers highlighted a number of other issues. AOSIS,  BRAZIL, NIGERIA and DENMARK supported a clean development  fund, funded by developed countries in proportion to their  degree of non-compliance with targets. ARGENTINA sought  common definitions of sinks, including restoring degraded  soils. HUNGARY recalled its agreement to join Annex I and  noted its changes toward sustainable development.

VENEZUELA, QATAR, KUWAIT, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA called  for a mechanism to compensate fossil fuel exporting  countries for the economic losses resulting from the full  implementation. SPAIN, PORTUGAL, GERMANY, GREECE and  DENMARK noted their plans to cut emissions within the EU's  overall plan. ICELAND said that renewable energy would have  to play an increasing role.

# COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE

Delegates discussed the protocol draft contained in the COW  Chair's non-paper of 7 December. RUSSIA, supported by  NORWAY, UKRAINE, AUSTRALIA and ICELAND, proposed text  setting a collective Annex I net aggregate CO2 equivalent  emissions objective, with annexes for individual Parties'  objectives. The US expressed interest. Chair Estrada said  he would not discuss proposals without numbers. The G-77/CHINA said the proposal delayed the discussion of  numbers. TRINIDAD and TOBAGO, with TUVALU, said the annexes  would be problematic. The UK did not support the proposal  without numbers.

Several delegations suggested changes to the draft article  on sinks. The US proposed counting emissions on a net basis  but discounting 75% of emissions from sinks in the first  commitment period. Chair Estrada said sources and sinks  should not be selected to disguise what is being decided.  He asked delegates to be sincere for 48 hours.

Chair Estrada introduced a discussion on gas coverage.  Recalling his 'three plus three' proposal, he suggested a  different base year for the second basket. The US,  supported by NEW ZEALAND, proposed 1995. RUSSIA suggested  dealing with the six gases basket in the second commitment  period. ICELAND, supported by NORWAY and the EU, objected  to the US proposal because some countries had already made  efforts to reduce their emission of gases in the second  basket. NORWAY asked whether those Parties with sufficient  1990 data on the gases in the proposed second basket could  proceed with a full basket approach.   INDIA said the G-77/CHINA wished to revisit the issue after announcements on  QELROs numbers.

CANADA, suppported by NEW ZEALAND, RUSSIA and the US, asked  that its emissions trading text be substituted for Article  6, noting its guidelines and a section assigning  responsibility to Parties for all transactions, including  those by intermediaries. The G-77/CHINA and URUGUAY  requested deletion of the article, but said the text could  remain under consideration. He said the core issue is the  numbers. Chair Estrada said he failed to see how the  proposal reduces emissions. TOGO, supported by MALAYSIA,  proposed adjourning until numbers were proposed. NEW  ZEALAND said resolving trading would allow progress on  commitments. CHINA replied that until QELROs are resolved,  the protocol is meaningless.

The US said its number is a package, depending on what  gases are included, how sinks count, and what kinds of  flexibility are available. If there is no trading, the  number changes. He proposed an additional paragraph  extracted from Article 7 (Joint Implementation) permitting  projects between Annex 1 parties. The EU said the scope of  flexibility, including emissions trading, was contingent  upon QELROs numbers. COLOMBIA said the ability to display  flexibility had just about run out among non-Annex I  countries. SAMOA suggested that the provision of a range of  numbers would assist the debate on emissions trading.  UKRAINE defended retaining Articles 6, 7 and 8 because they  define the mechanisms for implementation. RUSSIA supported  a proposal from the Chair to close discussion, and  suggested a protocol between the EU and G-77/CHINA. UGANDA  said there would be no 'free' trading of emissions. Chair  Estrada announced his intention to produce a paper with a  proposed final approach, with QELROs numbers and positions.  The deadline for Parties to deliver their own numbers would  be 3:00 pm Tuesday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Pressure is building on Annex I countries to deliver their  target numbers for QELROs as negotiations go to the wire.  Tensions emerged at a meeting of the newly formed extended  Bureau Monday - a meeting of delegates and ministers  described by one participant as a 'poker game' where only  half the players are in on the final deal. Developing  country Parties had reportedly lost patience with  industrialized countries determined to bring home a final  package without consulting their 'significant others' from  the G-77/CHINA, now represented on the extended Bureau.  This despite the expectation that after this complex  endgame a number of key G-77 players are expected to  participate meaningfully, having calculated their potential  gains from incentives offered. So far, though, the only  number coming out of the negotiations is Chair Estrada's 3  o'clock QELROs deadline.
