# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND (SCCF)

Following agreement on the SBI  Chair's request not to propose new language but rather to work  from the existing text, delegates discussed ways to remove the  remaining brackets on priority and focal areas for the Fund.  Portugal, for the EU, and South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA,  expressed optimism that an agreement could be reached. However,  delegates were unable to make significant progress. Areas of  disagreement included a proposal by the EU, opposed by the  G-77/CHINA, that the SCCF be used to 'support technical  assistance.' Following consultations with the Co-Chairs, it was  decided that negotiations would cease, and that the text would be  given to the SBI Chair, with a recommendation that it be  forwarded to COP 11 for its consideration.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Informal consultations on national  communications from non-Annex I Parties convened in the morning.  The G-77/CHINA summarized discussions leading up to Australia's  proposal to combine a submission window with a possible extension  period. He reiterated his understanding that the starting point  for the submission period was four years, with the possibility of  a one-year extension, without any implications for GEF funding.  The EU offered to drop any reference to the length of the  submission period, retaining only text noting that any extensions  will not imply additional financial resources from the GEF. The  consultations were adjourned until the afternoon, while Parties  from GEF donor countries verified that the draft language  circulated had no implications for GEF guidance. On reconvening,  the EU, CANADA, JAPAN, US, AUSTRALIA and the G-77/CHINA agreed to  the draft decision. The US added that, while she was pleased to  have reached agreement, there were elements missing from the draft  decision that should be kept in mind for a future negotiation.

The draft decision, as agreed, acknowledges the importance of  updating inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources and  removals by sinks, and the importance of measures to facilitate  adequate adaptation. It decides, inter alia: that non-Annex I  Parties shall make all efforts to submit their second and, where  appropriate, third national communication, within four years of  initial disbursement of finance; that Parties, if necessary and  based on national circumstances, may use an extension of up to one  year for submission and that any extensions shall not imply  additional GEF funding; that LDCs may submit second national  communications at their discretion; and that further discussion  will take place on implementation of UNFCCC Article 12.5 (national  communications) at COP 15. SAUDI ARABIA was offered reassurance  that the decision does not set a deadline of 'before 2006' for  applications for financing subsequent communications for Parties  that have had an initial disbursement more than five years ago.  With agreement on the text, the consultations were closed.

### RESEARCH NEEDS RELATING TO THE CONVENTION

In the morning,  delegates met in informal consultations to draft SBSTA conclusions  and COP decisions, which were later presented to the contact  group. Co-Chairs Castellari and Cigarán presented the two draft  texts, noting that these were based on previous conclusions and  discussions held since SB 16, and that the draft texts aimed to  establish dialogue between the research community and SBSTA. In  the draft conclusions, SBSTA stresses the need for research into  technologies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change.  After making minor editorial changes, delegates agreed to the  draft SBSTA conclusions and draft COP decisions.

### MATTERS RELATING TO THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

Delegates  continued informal discussions on draft COP 11/MOP 1 decisions in  the morning. They reconvened in a contact group throughout the  afternoon and into the evening. Debate centered on an EU proposal,  supported by NORWAY, CANADA and JAPAN, that the text should  indicate that the LDC Fund should provide additional costs  required to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change as  identified and prioritized in the NAPAs. Delegates also debated  other issues, including how to reference the application of a  co-financing model for NAPA activities. CANADA, supported by  several parties, proposed that such a model should be developed by  the GEF 'taking into account the circumstances of LDCs.' The  contact group was suspended at 11:40 pm and will reconvene on  Thursday.

### ADAPTATION

Delegates met for informal consultations in the  morning and afternoon on the five-year programme of work on the  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change. They also  continued discussions in a contact group in the late afternoon and  evening, where Co-Chair Shevlin presented draft text for general  comments. On the objectives of the programme, the G-77/CHINA  proposed alternative text stressing practical actions and the  needs of the most vulnerable. The EU and the US objected to this  reference, saying that the programme of work should be relevant to  all parties. Further areas of disagreement included whether and  where to include reference to Decision 1/CP.10, or to the section  within 1/CP.10 that relates to SBSTA. On issues to be addressed by  the work programme, the G-77/CHINA called for reference to both  adaptation and vulnerability assessments. Consultations were  continuing as of 11:00 pm.

### MITIGATION

Delegates met informally to consider the Co-Chairs'  draft conclusions. Agreement was reached on the Secretariat  reporting on lessons learned from the mitigation workshops, and on  invitations to Parties to submit their views on these lessons and  on future steps under this agenda item. However, differences  persisted on whether or not to provide an opportunity for Parties  to make presentations on these issues at SB 23, and on what format  this would take. The EU, JAPAN and CANADA, opposed by G-77/CHINA,  US and AUSTRALIA, proposed a pre-session workshop. Consultations  will continue Thursday morning.

### EMISSIONS FROM INTERNATIONAL AVIATION AND MARITIME TRANSPORT

Informal consultations were facilitated by José Romero  (Switzerland), with delegates considering draft conclusions.  Highlighting various methodological and other issues, the EU  suggested setting out a process, which might include a workshop or  other experts' event. Some other Parties, including the US,  questioned whether or not a workshop was needed. SAUDI ARABIA  objected to the EU proposal, preferring shorter text that did not  elaborate on the issue.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates met throughout the day in two  informal sessions and in a small group setting. The morning  session focused on the terms of reference of the EGTT. Agreement  was reached on the paragraph on involvement of the private sector.  However, little progress was reported on the other outstanding  issues: assessment of implementation of COP decisions, the review  of progress made under the framework, and consideration of  long-term strategies for technology transfer.

During the afternoon session, Parties addressed draft conclusions,  paragraph-by-paragraph. Agreement was reached on text referring to  the TT:Clear technology information clearing house, the follow-up  workshop for innovative options for financing, engaging the  private sector, and inviting additional financial support.  Delegates also agreed to delete a request to SBI regarding the  SCCF and the GEF. Disagreements persisted on text referring to  UNDP and the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI), publicly-owned  and public domain technologies, adaptation technologies, and the  consideration of specific technologies. Consultations will resume  Thursday.

### SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES

Informal consultations continued,  with delegates considering text on how SBSTA, SBI and/or the COP  might address the issue of further implementation of the Mauritius  Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action  for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.  An attempt at a compromise formulation was proposed by Australia,  which suggested text inviting Parties to submit 'views on further  implementation of relevant aspects of the Mauritius Declaration  and Strategy through ongoing work of the SBI and SBSTA as  appropriate.' Further consultations will be held.

### CDM AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES

Draft conclusions were  finalized by Chair Børsting on the implications of project  activities under the CDM for the achievement of objectives of  other environmental conventions and protocols, as no further  comments were received by Wednesday midday. The Chair's draft  conclusions, inter alia, request the Secretariat to prepare an  options paper with relevant inputs from submissions by Parties and  by the Executive Board of the CDM.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates were celebrating in several contact groups Wednesday at  the completion of their work. In particular, the conclusion of  discussions on non-Annex I Parties' submissions of national  communications, which have been under negotiation for two and a  half years, resulted in 'a collective sigh of relief,' according  to one observer.

Meanwhile the decision to forward ongoing debates over the Special  Climate Change Fund to Montreal was a sign of SB 22's 'technical'  and 'low key' nature, according to several participants. 'At this  stage, anything remotely political or problematic will likely end  up on the COP or COP/MOP's plate,' said one delegate.
