# INFORMAL MEETINGS

### LULUCF

The group resumed discussions on the consolidated  synthesis of Party submissions on LULUCF. Regarding which  additional activities should be included under Protocol  Article 3.4, JAPAN and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION said  activities should be defined broadly and based on national  circumstances. JAPAN, supported by AUSTRALIA, and opposed  by TUVALU, said Article 3.4 should be applied from the  first commitment period. The EU supported a phased-in  approach. CANADA and AUSTRALIA noted inclusion of  revegetation on degraded lands as a point of convergence.

On accounting for additional activities under Article 3.4,  AUSTRALIA supported a comprehensive accounting system  including non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Regarding overall  accounting approaches, TUVALU supported accounting for  social and cultural implications, and consistency with the  ecosystem approach under the Convention on Biological  Diversity and with the principles of sustainable  development. AUSTRALIA opposed including textual reference  to sustainable development specifically for LULUCF.

On accounting interlinkages and Protocol Article 3.7  (calculating assigned amounts in the first commitment  period), the EU and the UK highlighted the potential  problem of double-counting and the need for consistency.  Regarding accounting for human-induced and natural changes  in carbon stocks, SWITZERLAND supported a political rather  than technical decision to distinguish human-induced and  natural changes.

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson then introduced the compilation text  of country-specific data and information submitted by  Parties, and the document on implications of accounting  frameworks on preliminary assigned amounts during the first  commitment period. The EU and TUVALU highlighted the  incompleteness of existing data, and delegates discussed  specific data submissions.

### COMPLIANCE

Parties resumed discussions on the respective  mandates of the facilitation and enforcement branches of  the compliance body. The G-77/CHINA expressed preference  for, inter alia: delineating mandates clearly; implementing  the principle of comprehensiveness; limiting the  enforcement branch's mandate to Annex I Parties; and  ensuring that the enforcement branch only address issues  following specific requests. The EU, opposed by CHINA and  SAUDI ARABIA, preferred the branches to have different  expertise corresponding to their functions. AUSTRALIA, the  US and NEW ZEALAND supported legal expertise for the  enforcement branch, but with access to technical expertise  when required. The US suggested that the enforcement  branch's mandate include, inter alia: determining non- compliance with Protocol Article 3.1 (commitments);  determining failure to meet eligibility requirements for  mechanisms; and applying outcomes that have been agreed in  advance, with discretion regarding submission of issues to  the facilitation branch. CHINA, with SAMOA, BRAZIL, CHILE  and VENEZUELA, and opposed by AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN, the  US and NEW ZEALAND, argued that the mandate of the  enforcement body should include Protocol Articles 2.3 and  3.14 (adverse effects). The UK clarified that there were  two types of obligations, namely obligations of conduct and  obligations of result. While results could be measured,  conduct could not, and therefore only obligations of  results should be subject to the enforcement branch.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

CDI Presentation: Avani Vaish, GEF,  presented an overview of the Capacity Development  Initiative (CDI). He said the first phase of the CDI  consisted of generic assessment of country-level capacity  needs conducted at the regional level. The next phase would  be the development of a strategy and multi-year action  plan. He said the CDI is neither meant to launch projects  nor form the basis for a general global programme. John  Hough, UNDP, said the second phase will be a consultative  process based on, inter alia, guidance from the COP,  assessment reports and consultations in a second round of  regional meetings. Participants then heard presentations of  the key findings from the CDI regional assessments  outlining issues, priorities, problems and needs.

In the ensuing discussion, the G-77/CHINA questioned the  value of the CDI as a separate initiative, noting that much  of what had been raised through this process had been  previously elaborated in COP decisions. In response, Avani  Vaish said the CDI aimed to produce a systematic and  comprehensive approach to better implement COP decisions.  The AFRICA GROUP recommended reformulating the Africa  regional report to reflect COP decision 10/CP.5 (capacity  building). The COOK ISLANDS, for AOSIS, stressed that the  special needs of Small Island Developing States (SIDS)  should be reflected in the synthesis report.

The G-77/CHINA requested the GEF to present a full report  on the CDI at COP-6, and asked if it was funded from the  budget allocated for climate change activities. GRENADA  stressed the need for an immediate response to the  identified needs.

Economies in transition: SBI Chair Ashe invited comments on  text outlining elements of a draft framework for capacity  building in countries with economies in transition (EITs).  Several Parties said the document would serve as a useful  text for further discussion. SLOVENIA stressed that EITs'  capacity and institutions needed strengthening to enable  fulfillment of commitments.

On guiding principles and approaches, CANADA suggested  removing a specific reference to the GEF, noting that it  was covered under a reference to 'multilateral and  bilateral funding agencies.' On objectives and scope of capacity building, CANADA and  the US questioned reference to supporting new institutions.  HUNGARY proposed new 'institutional capacity.' The US, with  HUNGARY, suggested that capacity building focus on  implementation of the FCCC and Protocol, rather than  sustainable development. She sought clarity on references  to timeframes and benchmarks, and, with the EU, queried  whether support for technologies constituted capacity  building.

On implementation, the EU, with NORWAY and the US,  emphasized the need for EITs to provide an enabling  environment. The US, with HUNGARY, emphasized the need for  coordination between EITs and donor agencies. CANADA and  the US questioned reference to the 'prompt implementation'  of the framework. Revised text will be considered on  Friday.

### MECHANISMS

The FCCC Secretariat presented eight liability  options for emissions trading, namely originating party  liability, shared liability, acquiring party liability,  trigger, compliance reserve, commitment period reserve,  units in surplus to plan, and surplus units. He divided the  options into two groups: those following determination of  non-compliance and those seeking to prevent non-compliance  due to over-selling. The US, NEW ZEALAND, CANADA and  AUSTRALIA stressed the role of the private sector and the  advantages of issuer liability. SWITZERLAND highlighted  concerns with the problem of overselling, cautioned against  relying solely on seller liability, and re-emphasized his  support for units in surplus to plan. The EU presented an  option representing a mix of shared and acquiring party  liability. He noted a preference for the last-in-first-out  system, arguing that it reduces the domino effect and  introduces a level of certainty in the system. The G-77/CHINA supported surplus units, and emphasized the  importance of nature and scope, supplementarity, and the  precautionary approach. SAMOA said the emphasis should be  on the preventative options in the text. NEW ZEALAND urged  an integrated domestic and international trading system,  while SAMOA noted that such a system was not mentioned in  Protocol Article 17 (Emissions Trading), and highlighted  the need to discuss it in the context of the nature and  scope of emissions trading.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

The group met to consider the  cross-cutting issue of assigned amount reporting by  Parties. Following the introduction of the draft text from  the mechanisms group, SAUDI ARABIA said the G-77/CHINA was  not in a position to comment on the text. Co-Chair Plume  responded that the purpose of introducing the text was  simply to assist in work on the guidelines under Article 7,  not to make decisions on the text. The group then  considered the section of the guidelines under Article 7 on  transfer and acquisitions of emissions reduction units,  certified emission reductions, and assigned amount units  corresponding to work in the mechanisms groups. Delegates  discussed timeframes and modes for reporting on information  under assigned amounts. The US suggested that the FCCC  Secretariat consolidate a new version of the text  discussed, in consultation with the Parties.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Participants continued consideration  of the draft framework for meaningful and effective actions  to enhance the implementation of FCCC Article 4.5  (technology transfer) contained in the non-paper. The  PHILIPPINES, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern that  needs were still being assessed after five years. She  recalled her proposal to include a section in the framework  addressing actions taken to implement the commitment to  transfer technology, and suggested revisiting the issue of  developing an Intergovernmental Advisory Panel on  Technology. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, supported by CHINA,  called for clarification on the means of implementation of  FCCC Article 4.5, and on the responsibility and conditions  for implementation.

On needs assessment, CANADA proposed an integrated approach  beyond needs assessment in a narrow sense, to improve the  enabling environment for technology transfer. The G-77/CHINA volunteered to draft a concise paragraph summing  up the issues related to needs assessment.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Resuming discussions on the Co-Chairs'  text, ZIMBABWE, for the G-77/CHINA, indicated that emphasis  on the use of national communications to report on actions  and assess vulnerability should not constrain actions in  the most vulnerable and least developed countries that may  not already have disseminated or compiled this information  due to, inter alia, lack of capacity and funding. The US  said other sources of information were acceptable, and  stressed that actions should be focused and effective. The  G-77/CHINA highlighted that the text should reflect the  importance of creating a fund to support these activities.  JAPAN, supported by the US, recalled that the GEF was the  vehicle for this funding. CANADA, supported by NORWAY, the  UK, and US, stressed the need for strengthening references  in the text to the country-driven approach, national  circumstances and sustainable development. CANADA suggested  requesting the FCCC Secretariat to organize workshops on  adverse effects and on response measures, and report the  outcomes at COP-7. Delegates discussed the importance of  rapid response systems to climate events. The EU cautioned  against creating a separate disaster fund for climate- related events.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some participants speculated that the reasons for the  criticisms levelled at the GEF's Capacity Development  Initiative during Wednesday's meeting could be sourced to  concern about the financing of the CDI and the implications  in terms of support for other climate-related activities. A  number alleged that a lack of transparency in the selection  of regional consultants and in the manner in which the  process was conducted in certain regions detracted from  substantive discussions on the assessment results. On a  more optimistic note, others pointed out that the CDI's  reports have at least reaffirmed the main priority areas  previously highlighted for urgent action, and added that  this can contribute to the development of a clear and  focused COP-6 decision.
