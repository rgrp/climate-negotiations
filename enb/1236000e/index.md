# PLENARY

### MINISTERIAL SEGMENT

COP President H.E. Chen Chimutengwende  (Zimbabwe) introduced the high level segment of the Plenary.  He said high level input will be instrumental in advancing  the Berlin Mandate process. A new impetus is needed in the  work of the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin Mandate so that  negotiations can begin. FCCC Executive Secretary, Michael  Zammit Cutajar, invited Ministers to: undertake additional  efforts; endorse the SAR; start urgent negotiations on the  Berlin Mandate; address developing country Party needs for  financial support; and ensure serious review of  implementation of future commitments.

### SWITZERLAND

Ruth Dreifuss, Federal Councillor and Head,  Federal Department of the Interior, recommended that the COP  endorse the SAR and invited countries whose economic  development is sufficient to join the OECD to voluntarily  fulfill Annex I responsibilities. The Swiss GHG inventory  indicates that carbon dioxide emissions may stabilize at  1990 levels by 2000.

The G-77/CHINA: Manuel Dengo, Ambassador of Costa Rica to  the United Nations, said developed country Parties must  strengthen their commitments in Articles 4.2 (a) and (b),  including elaboration of policies and measures and QELROs  with specified time frames. They are setting a bad precedent  by evading responsibilities. The GEF's actions depend on  decisions of the COP and not the reverse.

The EU: Brendan Howlin, Minister for the Environment of  Ireland, reaffirmed the EU's commitment to an ambitious  outcome to the Berlin Mandate. The EU is on course to return  CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. Carbon dioxide  concentration levels lower than 550 parts per million should  guide global efforts. He called for a ministerial  declaration that endorses the SAR and the precautionary  principle, calls for enhanced implementation, and invites  new proposals on the Berlin Mandate process, which must be  accelerated.

### AOSIS

Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of Western Samoa to the United Nations, said  GHG reductions are technically possible and economically  feasible. He advocated the targets and timetables set out in  an AOSIS protocol and endorsement of the SAR.

### CENTRAL AMERICA GROUP

Luis Flores Asturias, Vice President  of Guatemala, described political changes in the region and  said Parties must strengthen commitments in Articles 4.2 (a)  and (b) and support the Berlin Mandate process to establish  verifiable and time tabled reductions.

### POLAND

Stanislaw Zelichowski, Minister of Environmental  Protection, said reduced emission levels by economies in  transition helped to offset slight increases by OECD country  Parties. Some countries may be obliged to increase GHGs to  pursue their right to economic and social development.

### AUSTRALIA

Robert Hill, Minister of the Environment, voiced  his commitment to fulfilling his obligations under the FCCC  and acknowledged the importance of the SAR. He said it would  be premature to establish a particular point at which levels  of GHGs become dangerous. He supported the reduction of CO2  emissions under the precautionary principle, the enhancement  of carbon sinks, the cultivation of AIJ programs and a  cooperative and equitable approach.

The US: Timothy Wirth, Under-Secretary of State for Global  Affairs, endorsed both the IPCC and the SAR, noting the SAR  as a basis for urgent action. He called on countries not to  ignore the science nor allow action to be delayed by those  'bent on obfuscating the results'. He stressed the need to  focus on real and achievable targets which incorporate  measured adjustments. He opposed mandatory harmonized  policies and measures.

### GERMANY

Angela Merkel, Federal Minister for the  Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, said  the SAR confirms the need for more intensive action. The  goals of the FCCC can only be achieved through international  cooperation that recognizes Parties' 'common but  differentiated' responsibilities. She stressed the need for  flexibility, particularly for economies in transition, as  well as legally binding commitments for policies and  measures, noting that some measures will only be effective  if harmonized among Annex I countries.

### JAPAN

Sukio Iwadare, Minister of State, Director General of  the Environment Agency, urged the COP to shift its emphasis  from analysis and assessment to negotiation by consolidating  the points and proposals. He called for the formulation of a  legal instrument that reflects: precautionary measures;  environmental effectiveness; equitable and efficient  distribution of policy efforts; positive direction; creation  of a foundation for global measures; and the active  development and transfer of clean technologies.

### INDONESIA

Sarwono Kusumaatmadja, Minister of the  Environment, noted his country's efforts to manage GHG  emissions, enhance its carbon sink capacity through improved  agricultural and land use practices and incorporate  precautionary measures into its coastal zone management  plan. He called on Annex I countries to increase their  efforts to reduce GHG emissions to levels stipulated in the  FCCC and urged the COP to adopt its rules of procedure. He  welcomed AIJ on a voluntary basis in accordance with the  Berlin Mandate, assistance with human resource development  and national capacity building, and equitable sharing of  benefits and differentiated responsibilities under the  Convention.

### CANADA

Sergio Marchi, Minister of the Environment, strongly  supported the SAR as a basis for urgent action, noting that  uncertainties regarding the rate and level of climate change  are not grounds for inaction. He said countries need to work  'harder, faster and smarter' and encouraged the development  and use of clean technologies, projects aimed at energy  efficiency and the involvement of governments, international  institutions, industry and NGOs in an open and transparent  process. He called for the establishment of targets for the  year 2000 and beyond.

### CHINA

Li Zhaoxin, Vice Minister, Ministry of Foreign  Affairs, fully supported the G-77/China. He called for the  use of sustainable consumption and production patterns, the  development of domestic policies and measures, recognition  of Parties' common but differentiated responsibilities, and  the need to set GHG emission targets with specific time  frames. He commended Annex I countries for their efforts in  producing national reports. He sought financial and  technological assistance for non-Annex I countries in  meeting their responsibilities under the FCCC.

### SWEDEN

Anna Lindh, Minister of the Environment, said a  continued strategy for reducing CO2 emissions should include  concrete technical measures in a protocol and called for  wise transformation of industrial processes, energy systems  and transport patterns. She also focused on economic  instruments to promote cost-effective measures and noted  Sweden's positive experiences with environmental taxes. She  recommended harmonized taxation on CO2 emissions as an  effective measure.

The NETHERLANDS: Margaretha de Boer, Minister of Housing,  Spatial Planning and Environment, said she is prepared for  serious negotiations on a protocol to the FCCC. She  supported the findings of the SAR and expressed confidence  that emission reductions can be achieved, provided that  industrial countries coordinate their actions. Parties  should accept that costs differ from country to country and  achieve reductions at the lowest cost. She also reported on  the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI) on behalf of the  OECD and the EUROPEAN COMMISSION. The CTI is a linked set of  international measures to promote awareness of technical  responses to climate change and identify and share expertise  between countries.

### GHANA

Sam P. Yalley, Deputy Minister of the Environment,  Science and Technology, noted that the anticipated impact of  climate change will be irreversible in his country. Although  Ghana has not prepared a national communication, it has  prepared an inventory of GHGs and has initiated 'no regrets'  measures. He highlighted the slowness of the process and  called for expeditious funding from the GEF. He expressed  strong concern regarding attempts to sway delegates from  taking measures recommended by the IPCC, particularly those  who based their arguments on economic losses.

The UK: John Gummer, Secretary of State for the Environment,  noted that in Rio developed countries agreed that they had  enjoyed the benefits of development, and must now shoulder  the burden. Many will not make their emission targets. He  disagreed with calls for a long-term GHG regime and said no  developed country can avoid taking action now. Developed  countries must help by exporting only clean technology. He  called for removing subsidies on the use of fossil fuels,  introducing competitiveness into energy markets, increasing  road fuel duties, improving fuel efficiency in cars,  increasing tax on aviation fuel by removing the present  exemption and improving domestic efficiency standards. He  noted that some of the most inefficient offices are owned by  the governments who talk the most about climate change.

### PORTUGAL

Elisa Ferreira, Minister of the Environment and  Natural Resources, said this Conference is the moment to  confirm agreements and to reaffirm the political will to  negotiate practical action. She noted a number of measures  currently underway in Portugal, and distinguished between  the need for economic growth and the need to lower  emissions. At the bilateral level, her country will engage  in many development projects designed to support the goals  of the FCCC.

### DENMARK

Svend Auken, Minister for the Environment and  Energy, contrasted the need for reductions and the forecast  for energy needs for the coming years and noted that even  the OECD countries will experience substantial growth. He  supported coordinated measures in taxation. He noted that  there will be an enormous volume of investment in the energy  sector and AIJ must be truly additional to this investment.  AIJ must not be a loophole for subsidizing energy exports to  developing countries, not a 'sorry excuse' for postponing  actions needed in developed countries.

# IN THE CORRIDORS I

Individuals attending the Ministerial Round Table reported  that participants addressed the theme of new scientific  findings and opportunities, and discussed whether the SAR  provided additional justification for political action, what  action is needed to reaffirm the credibility of existing  commitments of Annex I Parties and what action is needed to  give a new impulse to the negotiating phase of the Berlin  Mandate process. One observer reported that the Round Table  discussions mirrored those held throughout COP-2, with  delegates disagreeing on the weight to be given the SAR.  Some delegations strongly promoted both a protocol and a  ministerial declaration. It was reported that the Round  Table heard many interventions but had limited substantive  debate. Observers were unable to state decisively whether  the discussions were effected by the increased number of  participants or simply reflected how far ministers were  willing to go at COP-2.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

Consensus continues to elude COP-2 on a number of issues.  Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth, Chair of the Subsidiary Body for  Implementation, held separate consultations yesterday with  delegates of developed and developing countries to discuss  the Annex to the Memorandum of Understanding between the COP  and the GEF. Additionally, some observers suggested that the  deadlock over the rules of procedure will continue beyond  COP-2.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY
