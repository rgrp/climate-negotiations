# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### LULUCF

In the LULUCF contact group, Co-Chair Thorgeirsson  informed participants that the group's meeting on Thursday, 16  November, will focus on providing technical advice to the contact  group on mechanisms regarding inclusion of sinks under Protocol  Articles 6 (JI) and 12 (CDM). Participants then discussed the  sections on Definitions, Eligibility and Accounting Specific to  Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation, deforestation) in the  Co-Chairs' text.

On the definition of 'forest,' TUVALU supported the biome  approach, and said it should be elaborated by COP-7. The EU, the  ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, NORWAY and CHILE agreed, but said  the approach is not yet mature and the definition in the Co- Chairs' text will suffice for the time being. They said guidance  on the biome approach should be sought from the IPCC. The EU  stressed the need for consistency and symmetry within all  definitions, while CHINA said it would be premature to agree on  definitions relevant to Protocol Article 3.4 (additional  activities).

The EU, with NEW ZEALAND and opposed by CHINA, MALAYSIA and  BHUTAN, supported including the promotion of natural regeneration  within the definitions of 'afforestation' and 'reforestation.'  BRAZIL and PERU said natural regeneration is a management approach  according to the IPCC Special Report, and is not always human- induced.

On 'revegetation,' the EU, NORWAY and PERU noted the need for a  corresponding definition of 'de-vegetation.' On forest management,  CANADA, NEW ZEALAND and the US called for a simple and clear  definition.

The EU said the discussion should focus on definitions under  Article 3.3 and 3.4, noting that these definitions would not  necessarily be applicable under Articles 6 and 12, should sinks be  allowed under them. TUVALU, supported by MALAYSIA, objected to  defining assigned amounts (AA) within this contact group.

The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, PERU, MALAYSIA and CHINA,  opposed by CANADA and NEW ZEALAND, supported the COP, rather than  each Annex I Party, selecting the criteria for applying the  definition of 'forest' in the first commitment period.

On the issue of Eligibility, TUVALU and PERU said activities under  Article 3.3 subsequent to 1990 should not be eligible. Delegates  then discussed two eligibility requirement options: a list of  international agreements or a list of ancillary environmental  effects to be taken into account. NEW ZEALAND, with CANADA and  AUSTRALIA, proposed including text on the relationship between  implementation of activities and other international agreements in  the preamble. TUVALU proposed a new principle referring to the  non-eligibility under Article 3.4 of activities that convert  native forests.

On additional activities during the first commitment period, the  EU, TUVALU, CHINA, NORWAY and MALAYSIA, opposed by JAPAN, said  these should not be pursued. TUVALU and the ENVIRONMENTAL  INTEGRITY GROUP requested deletion of text that would allow  Parties to 'elect' the activities under Article 3.4 to be included  in the first commitment period. On additional activities during  the second and subsequent commitment periods, the EU, NORWAY,  TUVALU and MALAYSIA, opposed by JAPAN, said the COP should  establish a list prior to the second commitment period. AUSTRALIA  suggested introducing text ensuring definitional and accounting  consistencies between first and subsequent commitment periods. The  ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP supported a full carbon accounting  system that would not require the listing of activities, while  COLOMBIA expressed concern with an activity-based approach and  proposed a symmetrical approach.

Regarding the section of the text on Accounting Specific to  Article 3.3, the EU, US, PERU and TUVALU called for symmetry in  terms of credits for afforestation and reforestation on one hand  and debits for deforestation on the other.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

On reporting under Articles 10  (existing commitments) and 11 (financial mechanism), the G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US and EU, said Annex I Parties should  also be requested to report on the implementation of their  commitments related to the transfer of technologies and the  provision of 'new and additional' financial resources.

Regarding issuance and cancellation of assigned amounts (AA)  related to Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4, the G-77/CHINA, supported  by the EU and US, suggested referring to 'additions' and  'subtractions' from AA in the guidelines under Article 7. Opposed  by NEW ZEALAND and supported by INDIA, he added that, pending  agreement of this issue in the LULUCF group, any reference to  Article 3.4 should be bracketed. Co-Chair Newton Paciornik  (Brazil) said the Co-Chairs would consult on this issue with the  Co-Chairs of the contact group on LULUCF. In the guidelines under  Article 8, the G-77/CHINA suggested deleting Part III on the  review of information on AA. INDIA explained that AA are fixed  amounts and therefore cannot be reviewed, however the information  on additions and subtractions would be reviewed. BRAZIL, on behalf  of the G-77/CHINA, then introduced a text for a new Part III bis  that addresses the terminology 'initial AA' and replaces it with  'amounts that contribute to the compliance of a Party included in  Annex I with the quantified emission limitation and reduction  commitment under Article 3.' On expert review teams (ERTs), the G-77/CHINA recommended drawing  on a roster of experts and reflecting regional balance. He said  teams should be supported by the Secretariat and not by  governments, in order to ensure their impartiality.

On confidentiality, the EU introduced new text that provides,  inter alia, that the ERTs shall guarantee the confidentiality of  information that a Party indicates is confidential, and that if a  Party does not provide sufficient information for the assessment  of its conformity with the revised IPCC guidelines, the ERT shall  assume the estimate was not prepared accordingly. Commenting on  this proposal, SAMOA suggested that the Party be required to  provide the basis for confidentiality protection under domestic  legislation and that potential conflicts of interest with an ERT  member be dealt with before the team is formed.

On reporting of supplementary information under Article 7, the EU  proposed text for a section on 'domestic programmes,' which  requires reporting on domestic policies and measures as well as on  the domestic system for monitoring legal entities' participation  in international emissions trading. SAMOA supported this text,  while the US, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and NEW ZEALAND opposed it.

On 'questions of implementation,' the US, G-77/CHINA, BRAZIL and  INDIA opposed JAPAN's proposal to limit this concept to the  mandatory requirements of the guidelines under Articles 5.1  (national system) and 7.2 (supplementary information). Co-Chair  Paciornik said the Co-Chairs would prepare a revised text and  consult on it with different groups.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Delegates heard brief  reports from the two drafting groups that convened on Tuesday, 14  November to work on the Co-Chairs' revised text on a framework to  enhance the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (development and  transfer of technology). The EU reported that no major differences  remained in the group that had worked on the first three themes -  technology needs assessment, technology information, and enabling  environments. Speaking for the second drafting group, GHANA said  only the section on capacity building had been considered. He said  divergence remained on the inclusion of CDM and JI in the  framework. He also noted the discussion on and differences in the  use of the terms  'are encouraged to' or 'shall' when describing  actions in the framework.

Delegates then began considering the revised text from the first  drafting group. On the paragraph defining technology needs and  needs assessment, delegates debated whether to retain reference to  'Parties not included in Annex II, particularly developing country  Parties' as a way of addressing the proposal to also include  countries with economies in transition (EITs). The G-77/CHINA and  BRAZIL urged consistency with UNFCCC language and preferred  inserting 'other countries, particularly developing countries.'   The G-77/CHINA said the paragraph only refers to developing  country responsibilities and not how the needs assessment will  contribute to fulfilling commitments on technology transfer.  Discussion on this issue was deferred to further consultations.

Regarding the purpose of technology needs and needs assessment,  the PHILIPPINES sought clarification on how these would contribute  to the implementation of Article 4.5. She opposed a US proposal to  state that technology needs assessments can 'attract and focus  efforts by Annex II Parties to enhance development and transfer of  technology.' The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said the needs assessment  should be used to 'facilitate efforts' by Annex II Parties, while  the G-77/CHINA preferred stating that they should 'facilitate  transfer of and access to ESTs.' On financial resources to support needs assessment, the  PHILIPPINES proposed deleting 'subject to the availability of  resources,' noting that provision of financial resources is a  commitment elaborated under UNFCCC Article 4.3 (new and additional  financial resources). CANADA said Article 4.5 is not limited to  financial resources and preferred a general reference to  'resources.' The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, with PERU, said too much emphasis was being  placed on the needs assessment while losing focus on implementing  technology transfer. He said it would be difficult, if not  impossible, for public sectors to provide all information that  also covered the private sector. He emphasized the need to build  on existing activities and information. Cautioning against  shifting responsibility to developing countries, NIGERIA stressed  the need to refer to who will be responsible for the needs  assessment.

On the paragraph addressing implementation of technology needs and  needs assessment, the EU noted that differences of opinion  remained over the timing for SBSTA's consideration on this matter,  and on whether a fixed date should be set. Citing the possible  need for confidentiality of information, the PHILIPPINES opposed a  suggestion to make available such information through national  communications. The US supported the use of national  communications. The contact group adjourned to continue  deliberations in the two smaller drafting groups.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Delegates continued to discuss the text in the  draft decision, retaining brackets around a sub-paragraph on  'demonstration adaptation projects,' and on immediate  implementation of certain adaptation activities. On a sub- paragraph on disaster preparedness and management, CANADA,  supported by AUSTRALIA and the US, said disaster prevention was  impossible, and the terminology should reflect this. The G-77/CHINA, supported by MARSHALL ISLANDS and SAUDI ARABIA, said  that disasters were dependent on the impact of weather events on  human beings, and could therefore be prevented.  She supported  retaining the term 'prevention.' Discussion on the proposed  disaster fund was postponed pending outcomes on financial  discussions elsewhere.  Several brackets remained in the discussed  paragraph, pending decision on the wording of the chapeau, which  identifies financial resources for the activities outlined in this  paragraph. Later in the evening, a small Friends of a Chair group  met in a closed session to continue discussing the text. This  group will meet on Thursday to resume consideration on the  numerous outstanding issues, while the full contact group will  resume on Friday.

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Delegates resumed discussion on the  elements for a draft decision on 'best practices' or 'good  practices' in P&Ms among Annex I Parties. On the decision  requesting the Secretariat, under the guidance of the Chair of the  SBSTA and in collaboration with relevant international and  intergovernmental organisations, to support future work on P&Ms by  organizing, inter alia, workshops and side events, the EU,  supported by the US, CANADA and JAPAN, proposed removing reference  to specific international organizations. The G-77/CHINA and SAUDI  ARABIA urged retaining reference to the specific organizations,  and particularly OPEC. Reference to the international  organizations was bracketed. Delegates agreed that the Secretariat  operate under the guidance of the SBSTA, rather than the SBSTA  Chair.

On the decision inviting international organizations to present a  status report on their activities relating to P&Ms, the US,  supported by the EU and AUSTRALIA, proposed that this should be  integrated within the decision requesting the Secretariat to  support future work. The G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and BRAZIL urged  keeping this as a separate decision, noting that it included  additional proposals. Parties did not reach agreement on this  issue.

The US and AUSTRALIA proposed deleting text requesting the  Secretariat to compile information on P&Ms implemented and planned  by Annex I Parties,  noting the significant resource implications  for the Secretariat. They said that if it was retained, then  reference should be limited only to the Convention. The G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA, SAMOA and BRAZIL proposed retaining the  request, and urged specific reference to the Protocol. AUSTRALIA  and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, SAUDI ARABIA and SAMOA,  said the information to be compiled by the Secretariat should be  based exclusively on information supplied in the national  communications.

Following discussion, two alternative options for this decision  were developed: the first requests the Secretariat to compile  information on P&Ms implemented and planned under the Convention  and its Protocol by Annex I Parties, while the second requests the  Secretariat to compile information on P&Ms as reported in the  national communications by Annex I Parties and in the reports of  workshops and other events.

### MECHANISMS

Over thirty delegates from a range of Parties met in a  second closed 'informal informal' session until late on Wednesday  evening. Discussions, which at times took place in sub-groups,  focused on sections of the text relating to the CDM. It is  understood that on some of the issues 'steady progress' has been  made. Delegates will reconvene in an open session of the contact  group on Thursday at 12:00 pm.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Delegates met in 'informal informal'  consultations to consider a revised Co-Chairs' text on additional  guidance to the operating entity of the financial mechanism.  Discussions focused on text relating to the provision of GEF  resources for country-driven Stage II adaptation activities,  particularly the extent to which such activities are based on  national communications. Consultations are set to continue on  Thursday.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

A closed 'informal informal' meeting on  capacity building in developing countries was held late Wednesday  night to discuss the Co-Chairs' paper containing a draft decision  and an annex outlining a capacity-building framework.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Delegates commented on the Co-Chairs' draft proposals presenting  three options for the adoption of procedures and mechanisms on  compliance. The G-77/CHINA, supported by several members of its  group, said it was premature to decide on one option since the  mode of adoption depends on the content of the procedures and  mechanisms. However, she added that there was clearly a need for  legally-binding consequences and that consequently Protocol  Article 18, which refers to an amendment, would need to be taken  into account. JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, opposed  by the US and CANADA, supported adoption by a decision.  SWITZERLAND and NEW ZEALAND said adoption should be through a COP- 6 decision adopting an agreement becoming an integral part of the  Protocol, while the EU favored the option whereby the agreement  would be adopted at COP-7.

On consequences of the enforcement branch, NEW ZEALAND, opposed by  BRAZIL and INDIA, suggested new text on the issuance of assigned  amounts under Article 3.3 and 3.4. On the consequences of the  facilitative branch, the G-77/CHINA rejected an EU proposal that  does not differentiate between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. On  appeal, delegates made preliminary comments on a Co-Chairs'  proposal providing for the possibility of an appeal to the  COP/MOP. The G-77/CHINA favored a narrow scope such as issues of  due process and Article 3.1. A number of delegations said they  needed more time to consider the proposal.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The issue of nuclear energy in the CDM resurfaced on Wednesday,  with a number of observers picking up on possible shifts in  positions among some Parties. While talk in the corridors  suggested that some developing countries seemed to be taking a  more favorable view on including nuclear energy, some commentators  pointed to recent comments by a key Annex I Party that suggested  it might in fact be softening on its previously pro-nuclear  attitude.
