abstract: "Delegates to SB-20 resumed deliberations on Monday, convening in  SBSTA Plenary, numerous contact groups, and two SBSTA events. In  Plenary, delegates discussed the two in-session workshops on  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts of, and  vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change, and scientific,  technical and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation (adaptation and  mitigation). SBI contact groups discussed UNFCCC Article 6  (education, training and public awareness), arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings, non-Annex I national communications,  and capacity building. SBSTA contact groups addressed policies and  measures (P&Ms), technology transfer, adaptation and mitigation,  and small-scale afforestation and reforestation (A&R) project  activities under the CDM."

Two SBSTA events discussed information and research initiatives to  address recommendations of the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR),  and scientific and methodological aspects of the Brazilian Proposal  on differentiated emissions reduction targets for Parties according  to the impact of their historic emissions on temperature rise.

# SBSTA PLENARY

Chair Benrageb said Tony Surridge (South Africa) would co-chair  the contact group on P&Ms with Anders Turesson (Sweden).

### ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION

Chair Benrageb reported on the  in-session workshops on adaptation and mitigation. SOUTH AFRICA,  for the Africa Group, supported by the G-77/CHINA, AOSIS, and the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION, called for separate contact groups on  adaptation and mitigation. JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the US and EU  supported one contact group. AUSTRALIA, with several Parties,  suggested future in-session workshops. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  underscored addressing mitigation at the regional level. Many  Parties stressed the importance of regional modeling, and noted  the importance of integrating sustainable development policies  with adaptation measures. The US highlighted innovative  technologies. PERU suggested separating short-term needs from  long-term effects of climate change. MAURITIUS stressed increasing  adaptive capacity of vulnerable Parties. SAUDI ARABIA called for  addressing the impacts of response measures. The INTERNATIONAL  ALLIANCE OF TRIBAL PEOPLES OF THE TROPICAL FORESTS emphasized the  need to consider the concerns, rights and knowledge of indigenous  peoples when developing adaptation strategies. The WORLD  AGROFORESTRY CENTER called for broadening the debate beyond a  technological focus. Chair Benrageb proposed to have one contact  group co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and Kok Seng Yap  (Malaysia), with separate draft conclusions for each item.

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Chair Markus Nauser opened discussions on a  paper consolidating Parties' views and guidance to the Secretariat  for inclusion in the terms of reference for potential clearing  house contractors. The G-77/CHINA called for reference to clear  timelines and financial resources, and suggested inviting private  sector involvement in the development of the clearing house. Chair  Nauser cautioned against setting a schedule, as financing for  activities remains unresolved. The G-77/CHINA suggested  identifying costs as an initial task, and stressed the importance  of ensuring sustained financial flow for activities. The EU,  supported by NEW ZEALAND and the G-77/CHINA, suggested proceeding  with the call for tenders, while mentioning that any or none may  be chosen.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Chair Karsten Sach  presented draft conclusions covering the five agenda sub-items. On  arrangements for COP-10, the EU, CANADA and others supported the  themes as proposed for discussion in the high-level segment. SAUDI  ARABIA, with others, opposed by NORWAY, AOSIS, BURKINA FASO and  SOUTH AFRICA, suggested abandoning proposed discussions on energy.  The US, supported by the G-77/CHINA, and opposed by the EU, called  for reviewing the approach for selecting constituencies. On  effective participation in the UNFCCC process, the US, opposed by  the EU, called for text clarifying that participation includes  physical presence, and suggested reviewing the issue at SBI-22.  NORWAY pointed to financial implications of ensuring physical  presence of all Parties in all meetings related to the process.  Delegates exchanged views on textual proposals regarding  participation of indigenous peoples. While some Parties supported  exploring opportunities for participation by indigenous peoples,  others felt representation on national delegations would be  sufficient.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Chair Sok Appadu invited  delegates to discuss proposals from the US and EU on submission of  non-Annex I national communications. Regarding the US proposal,  which requests Parties to submit greenhouse gas inventories every  two years, BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, with others, raised  concerns that the proposal would impose additional costs. In its  proposal, the EU suggested a submission cycle of around 5 years,  and emphasized continuity. While agreeing to consider it, the  G-77/CHINA stressed that the proposal did not take into account  delays in funding disbursement. Parties discussed, inter alia, the  GEF funding guidelines and the timing of funds for preparing  subsequent national communications, while work on the previous one  is being completed.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Continuing negotiations on the draft conclusions,  delegates commented on reference to a technical meeting to complete  the review of the effectiveness and range of capacity-building  activities in developing countries. JAPAN opposed reference that  would make the completion of the review conditional on input from  such a meeting, while the EU agreed that further work is needed to  complete the review. She suggested a round-table discussion at  COP-10. Parties considered various options. The text remained  bracketed. Delegates also discussed dates for submitting information  on the effectiveness of capacity-building activities by EITs.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### P&MS

SAUDI ARABIA emphasized the importance of emissions reductions  and information sharing by Annex I Parties, and minimizing adverse  effects, including of P&Ms. The EU urged avoiding selective quoting  and ensuring a comprehensive understanding of decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms).  Parties agreed to use the latest version of a non-paper from COP-9,  with an amendment proposed by Saudi Arabia, as the basis for  discussion. SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/China, said the draft  conclusions should not be considered approved until agreement is  reached on all paragraphs. The LDCs said that the G-77/China did not  have a consensus position on P&Ms. SAUDI ARABIA suggested removing  reference to a status report on information exchange and deleting  text on the Secretariat's role in considering relevant on-going  activities under other agenda items and those undertaken by  international and intergovernmental organizations.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Parties continued discussions on new draft  conclusions. Delegates discussed reference to additional regional  workshops and the establishment of national databases of  technology needs assessments. Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh requested  the EU, US, CHINA, JAPAN and other interested Parties to consult  informally. Regarding topics for consideration for the EGTT's 2005  work programme, GHANA stressed the importance for the EGTT to  identify, assess and prioritize joint research programmes between  Annex I and non-Annex I Parties. Parties deliberated the extent to  which the EGTT has the authority to prioritize activities, and  agreed to a proposal by CANADA to request the EGTT to identify  possible joint research programmes. Parties then discussed  alternatives for text referring to the TT:CLEAR survey, and the  deadline for submissions on enhancing the implementation of the  framework for technology transfer for a possible COP-10 decision.

### ADAPTATION AND MITIGATION

Parties discussed format and content of  future workshops and activities. On adaptation, CHINA noted the  possibility of convening pre-sessional workshops. NEW ZEALAND,  with the GAMBIA, noted that this may prevent some Parties from  attending. The EU and CANADA called for written reports. The US  proposed allocating more time for discussion. CHINA, supported by  INDIA, suggested developing an action plan. The EU, US and CANADA  called for a more focused agenda and suggested developing an  Internet site. The EU, supported by INDIA, proposed Parties'  submissions on issues that should be considered. CANADA stressed  adaptive capacity and understanding local conditions. BRAZIL  highlighted integration of natural and social sciences. The GAMBIA  supported an integrated assessment of adaptation approaches. JAPAN  highlighted information exchange. SAUDI ARABIA highlighted  integrating economic diversification with sustainable development  efforts.

On mitigation, SWITZERLAND favored convening expert workshops.  UGANDA proposed developing a work programme. JAPAN, CANADA and the  EU preferred in-sessional workshops. JAPAN called for further  information sharing and, with the US and CANADA, discussing  technologies. SAUDI ARABIA said information exchange should be in  accordance with UNFCCC Article 4 (commitments). The US, with  CANADA, proposed examining 'win-win' opportunities. UGANDA, with  CHILE, proposed developing a plan of action. CANADA stressed the  importance of considering implementation barriers and barriers,  incentives and options to promote technological research and  development. PERU proposed working in small groups during workshops.

### SMALL-SCALE A&R PROJECTS UNDER THE CDM

Parties heard reports from  informal groups and considered a non-paper. Delegates agreed to  include environmental and socioeconomic impact assessments in the  project design document with bracketed text referring to 'adequate  to scale.' On baselines, Parties agreed to assume the baseline  carbon stock is constant throughout the crediting period, and  decided that the CDM EB would develop simplified monitoring  methodologies for actual net removals. On monitoring, BURKINA  FASO, BOLIVIA and others called for explicit reference to  involvement of local participants.

# SBSTA EVENTS

### RESEARCH IN RESPONSE TO THE IPCC TAR

This event was chaired by  Pier Vellinga, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Jean  Palutikof, IPCC, explained how research needs on impacts  identified in the TAR are being addressed under the Fourth  Assessment Report. Ogunlade Davidson, IPCC, outlined research  needs on mitigation identified by the TAR. Anver Ghazi, European  Commission, outlined climate change research undertaken under the  5th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development  and other initiatives.

Frank McGovern, European Community, presented on climate change  research initiatives in EU Member States. Hiroki Kondo, Frontier  Research System for Global Change, Japan, noted several climate  models, including climate change projection scenarios.

Quinchen Chao, China Meteorological Administration, outlined  national climate change plans and research activities. Gilles  Sommeria, World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), WMO, reported  on WCRP's work on global observing systems and modeling. Barbara  Göbel, International Human Dimensions Programme, urged putting  humans at the center of analysis. Janos Bogardi, UN University  Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS), spoke on  the recently established UNU-EHS. John Christensen, UNEP,  highlighted UNEP's role in capacity building and facilitating  applied research.

In the discussion, participants addressed the need to review the  adequacy of research to meet UNFCCC needs, coordinate the work of  institutions, and address the gap between natural and social  sciences.

### BRAZILIAN PROPOSAL

Murray Ward (New Zealand) chaired this event.  Niklas Höhne, EcoFys, Germany, presented on the modeling and  assessment of contributions to climate change (MATCH), noting that  MATCH includes an ad hoc group initiated by the UK and Brazil.  Xiaosu Dai, China Meteorological Administration, spoke about the  status of the MATCH process, and said its strengths include  participation of leading experts, joint research efforts, and peer  reviewed publications. Höhne outlined the models used to calculate  accumulated emissions contributions and the indicators used to  address these. Michel den Elzen, National Institute of Public  Health and Environment, the Netherlands, discussed policy options  under the Brazilian Proposal in terms of time frames. He said that  the research had evaluated different influences of policy-related  and scientific choices. Chair Ward informed participants of other  scientific groups working on the Brazilian Proposal.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Despite the previous week's apparent lack of momentum, the final  week of the meeting began with an intense schedule of contact  groups, leaving delegations exhausted, if only from running around  the Maritim. Some observers felt that many of the discussions saw  at least the creation of a basis for progress, with important  ground-work laid in the contact groups on adaptation and  mitigation, and on national communications. Others feared  entrenchment of negotiating positions on accounting for sinks  would heat up the rest of the week.
