# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme  (UNEP). The purpose of the IPCC is to assess the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding  the risks associated with human-induced climate change. The IPCC  does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor  climate-related data, but bases its assessments on published and  peer-reviewed scientific and technical literature. Its  Secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is staffed by  WMO and UNEP.

Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of  comprehensive assessments, special reports and technical papers,  providing scientific information on climate change to the  international community, including policymakers and the public.  This information has played an important role in the negotiations  under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC). The UNFCCC, which provides the overall global policy  framework for addressing climate change, was adopted in 1992 and  entered into force in 1994.

The IPCC currently includes three working groups: Working Group I  addresses the scientific aspects of the climate system and climate  change; Working Group II addresses the vulnerability of  socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, negative and  positive consequences of climate change, and options for adapting  to it; and Working Group III addresses options for limiting  greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change.

The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas  Inventories. This Task Force oversees the IPCC National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories Programme (NGGIP), which aims to develop and  refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the  calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and  removals, and to encourage the use of this methodology by  countries participating in the IPCC and by UNFCCC signatories. The  IPCC Bureau, which has roughly 30 members elected by the Panel,  assists the IPCC Chair in planning, co-ordinating and monitoring  progress in the work of the IPCC.

### KEY IPCC PRODUCTS

The IPCC completed its initial comprehensive  assessments of climate change in the First Assessment Report in  1990 and the Second Assessment Report in 1995. The IPCC's Third  Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001. It addresses  policy-relevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic  dimensions of climate change, and concentrates on findings since  1995 at both regional and global levels. The TAR, which was  subject to extensive peer review from experts and governments, is  composed of a comprehensive assessment from the three IPCC Working  Groups, a Summary for Policymakers and a Technical Summary of each  Working Group report, and a Synthesis Report. The TAR Synthesis  Report is written in a non-technical style aimed at policymakers  and addresses nine policy-relevant questions identified by the  IPCC based on submissions by governments. The IPCC's Fourth  Assessment Report (AR4) is due to be released in 2007.

Since 1991, the IPCC has also worked on technical guidelines for  assessing greenhouse gas inventories. The IPCC Guidelines for  National Greenhouse Gas Inventories were first released in 1994,  and a revised set was released in 1996. The UNFCCC's 1997 Kyoto  Protocol reaffirmed the use of the Guidelines for preparing  national greenhouse gas inventories by Parties to the UNFCCC and,  in the future, by Parties to the Kyoto Protocol. In 2000 and 2003,  the Panel approved additional good practice guidance reports that  complement the Revised 1996 Guidelines and, also in 2003, approved  a process for producing a further revised set of Guidelines in  early 2006.

### NINETEENTH SESSION

Beginning at its nineteenth session, held from  17-20 April 2002, in Geneva, Switzerland, the IPCC began work on  the AR4. Participants made a number of decisions, including in  relation to a draft work plan for developing definitions for  forest degradation and devegetation, methodological options for  recording and reporting on emissions from these activities, and  aspects of the procedures for agreeing on NGGIP products.  Participants also decided: on the timing of the AR4; to hold a  workshop on geological and oceanic carbon separation, capture and  storage; to draft a scoping paper on climate change and water; and  to hold an expert meeting on climate change and development.

### TWENTIETH SESSION

IPCC-20 was held from 19-21 February 2003, in  Paris, France. Participants agreed on a work plan for two expert  'scoping meetings' on how to structure the AR4. They also  discussed a framework and a set of criteria for establishing  priorities for special reports, methodology reports and technical  papers for the period of the fourth assessment. They also decided  to hold a high-level scientific meeting to survey the processes  affecting carbon stocks and human influences upon them and to  produce two special reports: one on safeguarding the ozone layer  and the global climate system; and the other on carbon dioxide  capture and storage.

### TWENTY-FIRST SESSION

At IPCC-21, held from 3-7 November 2003, in  Vienna, Austria, participants reviewed the outlines of the  proposed Working Group contributions to the AR4 and the Chair's  proposal for an AR4 Synthesis Report. Participants agreed that a  technical paper on climate change and water should be completed in  2007, discussed terms of reference for a document on the AR4  product set, and reviewed the report of the IPCC expert meeting on  processes affecting terrestrial carbon stocks and human influences  upon them. The IPCC also approved the terms of reference for the  revision of the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National  Greenhouse Gas Inventories and agreed on a revised mandate and  changed the name of the Task Group on Scenarios for Climate and  Impact Assessment to Task Group on Data and Scenarios Support for  Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA).

### TWENTY-SECOND SESSION

IPCC-22 convened from 9-11 November 2004,  in New Delhi, India. Participants discussed the scope, content and  process for an AR4 Synthesis Report, AR4 products, outreach, the  IPCC programme and budget for 2005-08; and election procedures.  Participants also heard progress reports on: Working Group  contributions to the AR4; the Special Report on Safeguarding the  Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System; the Special Report on  Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage; the 2006 Guidelines for  National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; and the work of the TGICA.  The Panel adopted a decision on the IPCC programme and budget for  2005-08 and agreed to work towards a 30-page AR4 Synthesis Report  with a five-page Summary for Policymakers to be approved by the  IPCC in late October 2007. The Panel also discussed activities for  IPCC products.

### TWENTY-THIRD SESSION

IPCC-23 was convened on 8 April 2005, in  Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to consider the joint activities of Working  Groups I and II on the Special Report on Safeguarding the Ozone  Layer and the Global Climate System. The Panel accepted this  Special Report along with a Summary for Policymakers. In adopting  the draft report of IPCC-22, the participants also agreed that the  IPCC Bureau would further consider arrangements for management of  the AR4 Synthesis Report and report on its progress to the IPCC.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### IPCC EXPERT MEETING ON EMISSION ESTIMATION OF AEROSOLS RELEVANT TO  CLIMATE CHANGE

This expert meeting, organized by the Task Force  on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories with the assistance of WGI,  was held from 2-4 May 2005, in Geneva, Switzerland, to conduct a  preliminary assessment of issues related to developing estimates  for anthropogenic emissions of aerosols and to discuss  methodological approaches. Participants concluded that further  meetings should be held, involving WGI, NGGIP and other aerosol  inventory experts, and that these meetings should focus on several  issues, including: the needs of speciated aerosols emission data  and definitions; the use of existing inventory information; and  improvements in certain key source sectors.

### TWENTY-SECOND SESSIONS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BODIES TO THE UNFCCC

At  SB-22, held from 19-27 May 2005, in Bonn, Germany, the UNFCCC's  Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)  considered the Special Report on Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and  the Global Climate System prepared by the IPCC and the Technology  and Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol. In its conclusions,  SBSTA: encouraged parties to the UNFCCC to use the information in  the Special Report when developing national climate change  strategies; noted the ongoing need for research and measurement  relevant to the ozone layer, the global climate system and  potential interrelations; welcomed information from the  Secretariat for the Montreal Protocol on consideration of the  Special Report by the Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal  Protocol; and invited parties to submit their views to the UNFCCC  Secretariat on aspects of the Special Report relevant to the  UNFCCC's objective for consideration at SBSTA-24.

### IPCC WORKSHOP ON EMISSION SCENARIOS

At this meeting, held from  29 June to 1 July 2005, in Laxenburg, Austria, participants  investigated the possible roles that the IPCC could play in the  development and assessment of new emission scenarios in the period  after AR4 by identifying: various user needs and requirements;  scenarios for meeting those needs; and options for the IPCC with  regard to the development of such scenarios.
