# PLENARY

AGBM Chair Ra√∫l Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) noted that Evans  King (Trinidad and Tobago) had returned home. The non-group  on Article 4.1 will now be chaired by John Ashe (Antigua  and Barbuda). Luiz Gylvan Meira Filho (Brazil), Chair of  the non-group on QELROs, reported that the group considered  issues of coverage and related methodological issues and  noted that a Chair's proposal was forthcoming. He stated  that the non-group has also considered the nature of  targets and baselines and will produce a bracketed paper.  The question of whether the targets will be in annual rates  of emissions or in the form of a budget period was also  discussed. He noted a broad consensus that countries with  economies in transition should receive flexibility on their  initial baselines.

He informed delegates that a contact group will be meeting  to consider the issues of banking, borrowing and trading  emissions and issues regarding activities implemented  jointly (AIJ). On compliance, he noted that there have been  proposals considering the possible impacts on developing  countries. In the observer briefing prior to Plenary, he  stated that he had called on delegates to draft a more  precise text because joint implementation has different  meanings in several proposals. He noted that the text  regarding joint implementation would probably remain in  brackets. He stated that the distribution level and timing  of QELROS would most likely not be considered in this  meeting.

Takao Shibata, Chair of the non-group on institutions,  mechanisms and final clauses noted that there is broad- based consensus on the notion of institutional economy. He  stated that the same COP, Secretariat, subsidiary bodies  and financial mechanism would operate for both the  Convention and the Protocol. He noted that a Chair's  proposal would be available later and that the non-group  will consider issues related to introductory and final  elements at its next meeting.

The Chair established a non-group on policies and measures  (P&Ms) chaired by Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth (Mauritania) and  called on NGOs to make their presentations. The  INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL FOR LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES  (ICLEI) called on delegates to heed the lessons learned by  local governments implementing policies and measures to  reduce CO2 emissions. She said successful communities have  invested in energy efficiency and transportation projects  to reduce local energy use. She called on the AGBM to  implement aggressive emissions targets. She noted that  benefits of local initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions  outweigh the financial costs, and that reductions in CO2  emissions are a boon to the local economy and urban  livability. She noted that the primary constraint for  developing country cities is the lack of adequate financing  for urban infrastructure and called for the enhancement of  the financial mechanism to support developing country  cities.

A representative speaking on behalf of business and  industry NGOs noted the unique role that her sector plays  in furthering the objectives of the FCCC. She called on the  Parties to use the diversity of business interests as a  resource. She noted the following four elements of  sustaining a healthy international economic environment:  open markets free of trade barriers; orderly turnover of  capital stock and infrastructure; free flow of trade,  capital and technology with protection of intellectual  property rights; and a stable and transparent legal and  regulatory framework. She stated that business plays an  integral role in the development, commercialization and  dissemination of technologies. She noted the need to  analyze the impact of climate policies on national  economies, businesses and jobs and the potential benefits  of utilizing the technical and management expertise of the  business community. She stated that flexible approaches  that account for changing circumstances and information  provide for more effective solutions.

A representative from the CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK reminded  delegates of the pledges made by developed countries to  take the lead in combating climate change. She noted that  developing countries are concerned by the procrastination  shown by many developed countries. She highlighted the  impacts of climate change on regions afflicted by poverty  and noted that the IPCC will be releasing a regional impact  assessment in the fall. She stated that climate change  poses the highest risk for developing countries and that  the transfer of technology and financial resources to  developing countries has not occurred. She called on  developed countries to take concrete steps in setting  legally binding targets and timetables and noted support  for the AOSIS draft protocol.

JAPAN commented on an NGO report suggesting that Japan had  proposed targets that would allow for large increases of  CO2 emissions by Annex I countries by the year 2010. He  stressed that Japan had not made such a proposal and  reiterated Japan's position to reduce CO2 emissions to less  than 1 tonne per capita by the year 2100. He noted that any  protocol or legally binding instrument must fully encompass  the Berlin Mandate and the Geneva Declaration. He  underscored Japan's willingness to work with other  developed countries to set meaningful, realistic and  equitable targets that will result in the reduction of GHG  emissions by 2010. On QELROs, he indicated that Japan  places a high priority on finding a common ground  framework.

The Chair of the OECD Expert Group on Annex I Countries  indicated that the group sought to provide analytical  support for AGBM. He noted that it had embarked on an  ambitious programme on trading initiatives. The expert  group was seeking to propose practical options for  emissions trading and was assessing international criteria  on this. He mentioned that studies were being conducted on  monitoring and compliance mechanisms for QELROS and  indicated that the group sought to further support  countries with economies in transition in their GHG  mitigation efforts. He pointed out the expert group's  intention of continuing to report to the AGBM.

# NON-GROUP ON POLICIES AND MEASURES

Chair Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth convened the first meeting of  the non-group on policies and measures. The discussion  focused on whether P&Ms should be legally binding and  whether they should be differentiated. Some delegations  favored legally binding P&Ms and referred to proposals on  several annexes setting differentiated policies and  measures. A group of countries submitted a non-paper on  this issue. Other delegations favored a flexible approach  whereby countries should be able to set their own P&Ms. It  was decided that the Chair would produce a consolidated  text to facilitate the work of the group. However, some  delegations indicated that all positions should be duly  reflected.

# NON-GROUP ON INSTITUTIONS

At its morning session, the non-group discussed the Chair's  consolidated text on dispute resolution. Most of the text  remains in brackets. There was general agreement that there  should be provision for the possibility of a multilateral  co-operative process, while decisions about its relation to  AG13 (Multilateral Consultative Process) were left open.

In the afternoon, Parties engaged in a detailed exchange on  the core issue of the relationship that will be established  between the COP/FCCC and any new protocol or other legal  instrument. While there was general support for  'institutional economy,' whereby the COP shall serve as the  meeting of the Parties to the Protocol, opposing views were  put forward on what procedural rights the COP would have in  regard to the Protocol. Some developing countries were  uneasy with the prospect of the Protocol developing a life  of its own, and eventually subsuming the FCCC. They argued  for the right of all Parties to the Convention to propose  amendments to a Protocol. A number of developed country  Parties argued that this would not be legally possible and  that such a right should derive only from ratification.  Some indicated a concern that non-Parties would exercise  influence over the Protocol without coming into a new  process at some stage.

Much of the argument revolved around Parties' use of the  word 'integral' when describing the Protocol's relationship  to the COP/FCCC. A decisive intervention came when a  delegate with legal expertise suggested that Parties were  confusing a political and legal understanding of the term.  In Article 16.1 (FCCC), for example, the word integral is  used to describe annexes which legally become part and  parcel of the FCCC upon adoption. In such cases the  provisions of the FCCC are used exclusively where  amendments are required. He argued that it was not possible  to describe a Protocol as integral in the same sense. A  Protocol would not be legally part and parcel of the FCCC.  If this were not so, there would be no need to negotiate  formal and separate mechanisms for amending and ratifying a  Protocol, an independent legal instrument. It was fair,  however, to describe the Protocol as politically integral  to the FCCC.

This distinction was heavily criticized by developing  country Parties who continued to argue that a Protocol  would be intimately bound up with the FCCC and subordinate,  citing FCCC Articles 4.2 (a) and (b) on Annex I Party  commitments, and 7.2, which affirms that the COP, as  supreme body, shall regularly review the implementation of  the Convention 'and any related legal instrument.' The  Chair is expected to produce a revised text including a  draft Preamble affirming that a Protocol will be intimately  bound up with the FCCC, with Articles underlining their  dependence on the FCCC process.

In the discussion on annexes, a number of developing and  newly industrialized countries sought to ensure that the  status of any Parties included in annexes evolving out of  the AGBM agreement would be subject to an amendment  procedure as rigorous as that which applies in the FCCC.

# NON-GROUP ON QELROS

The non-group on QELROs engaged in a procedural discussion  and established a series of contact groups on: possible  impacts on developing countries, compensation, policies and  measures, timing, communication of information, compliance  mechanisms and flexibility. It was agreed that contact  groups would produce documents on compliance, compensation  and policies and measures for further consideration. The  contact group on flexibility will consider emissions  budgets, joint implementation and banking. A draft  compilation text on these issues was circulated in the  evening. The group discussed annexes generally but did not  discuss Annex B. The group will consider issues related to  targets and differentiation at its next meeting.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

During the morning observer briefing, business NGO  representatives were unsuccessful in challenging the AGBM  Chair to clarify his earlier statement that a number of  items for discussion are, strictly speaking, not consistent  with the mandate of the AGBM. The Chair declined to comment  and said these matters were subject to interpretation. The  business lobbyists later indicated that they were concerned  about references in AGBM documentation to discussion topics  on evolution and the possible impacts on developing  countries of new commitments, and wondered what precise  instructions had been given to non-group chairs for dealing  with such issues.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

While some delegates and observers are giving increasing  attention to the impact on employment of potential AGBM  outcomes, a number of environmental NGOs have argued that  the issue is being manipulated to frighten political  constituencies in developed countries. They believe that  the success of the strategy has driven some developed Party  views on the need to bring developing countries on board  the Berlin Mandate process sooner rather than later -- and  avoid the alleged economic consequences of unilteral  commitments by Annex I countries.
