# SBSTA

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS

Several Parties stressed  the need to promote capacity building, technology transfer and  reporting as measures to support synergies. FAO reported on its  activities relating to agriculture, energy, and rural development,  and IUCN highlighted the need to integrate climate change measures  into protected areas management. Chair Thorgeirsson said Outi  Bergh√§ll (Finland) and Marcela Maim (Chile) would conduct informal  consultations on draft SBSTA conclusions.

### OTHER MATTERS

Issues relating to cleaner or less-greenhouse gas- emitting energy: CANADA, supported by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, and  opposed by the EU, G-77/CHINA and others, urged SBSTA to invite  Parties to submit views on these issues. Chair Thorgeirsson said  he would consult informally on the matter.

###     Issues relating to the implementation of Article 2.3

SAUDI ARABIA  urged progress on implementation of Article 2.3, while the EU said  issues related to this article have already been addressed in  earlier decisions. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would conduct  informal consultations on the issue.

###     Any other matters

On AIJ under the pilot phase, Chair  Thorgeirsson reviewed the change in frequency of AIJ synthesis  reports, and noted that 1 June 2004 is the deadline for the  submission of reports for inclusion in the seventh synthesis  report.

On the review of the scientific and methodological aspects of the  Brazilian proposal, the UK outlined the background and outcomes of  the third expert meeting, held in Berlin, Germany, in September  2003. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would draft conclusions on this  issue.

# SBI

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Programme budget for 2004-5:  The G-77/CHINA called for increased efficiency, expeditious use of  resources, and geographical and gender balance in the Secretariat,  and supported the inclusion of Protocol-related activities in the  Secretariat's core budget. He said the allocation of resources for  the sustainable development programme is inadequate to support  capacity building, technology transfer, adaptation, and the  implementation of the New Delhi Work Programme on UNFCCC Article 6  (education, training and public awareness). He also called for  more resources to support developing country participation in  UNFCCC-related processes and opposed the application of the UN  scale of assessment. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Waller-Hunter  noted measures taken by the Secretariat to enhance cost  efficiency, but cautioned delegates that despite these measures  the Secretariat will not be able to 'do more with less.' She said  the Secretariat has allocated resources to programmes according to  COP decisions, and applied the principles of equitable  distribution in resource allocation.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### SINKS IN THE CDM

This contact group was co-chaired by Thelma Krug  (Brazil) and Karsten Sach (Germany). Co-Chair Sach presented a Co- Chairs' non-paper based on pre-sessional and other informal  consultations. The non-paper includes amended text as well as a  joint submission by the EU and BRAZIL on non-permanence, and a new  version of Appendix E. Several submissions were also noted,  including on invasive alien species and GMOs, small-scale and  special projects, and the insurance approach to non-permanence.  Informal consultations will be held to advance the discussions.

### GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE ON LULUCF

This group was co-chaired by  Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) and Audun Rosland  (Norway). On the IPCC's Good Practice Guidance (GPG), NEW ZEALAND  suggested focusing on the GPG as a whole. CANADA and AUSTRALIA  said the GPG provides the necessary guidelines for reporting and  should be adopted. The US noted the need for practical experience  with the new reporting guidance and urged taking a decision on the  CRF as soon as possible.

On the CRF, the US and SWITZERLAND urged retaining links with the  Revised 1996 IPCC Reporting Guidelines, and, with the EU, said the  categories in the sectoral tables should be consistent with the  GPG. CANADA stressed the need to streamline the tables and make  them consistent. MALAYSIA urged the simplification of the tables.  Co-Chair Rosland noted that a small group would continue informal  discussions on this issue.

On factoring out, BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, supported by the EU,  said this reflected principles agreed in the Marrakesh Accords and  needs to be addressed before the second commitment period. On  harvested wood products, CANADA, supported by NEW ZEALAND and  NORWAY, proposed a workshop to build capacity and advance  knowledge, while the EU stressed submissions by Parties. Delegates  agreed to submit their views on the issue. Submissions will also  be requested on degradation and devegetation, for further  discussion at COP-10.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

This contact group, co-chaired by Terry  Carrington (UK) and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad & Tobago)  addressed elements of a future EGTT work programme. The US,  CANADA, JAPAN and EU said the EGTT's draft work programme is  ambitious, but manageable. The G-77/CHINA distributed, and later  elaborated upon, a paper on the draft programme of work focusing  on technology needs assessments, TT:CLEAR, enabling environments,  capacity building, mechanisms, innovative financing, and frequency  of meetings. The US and EU noted that several of the points in the  paper are already addressed in the draft work programme. Regarding  a suggestion that Annex I Parties report on capacity-building  activities, the EU said that all Parties should report. On  frequency of meetings, he said the availability of EGTT members  and budgetary restrictions must be considered. Co-Chair Carrington  said the Co-Chairs would prepare draft conclusions.

### R&SO

This group was co-chaired by Sue Barrell (Australia) and  Philip Gwage (Uganda). Parties discussed a draft decision and  draft conclusions on global observing systems for climate.  Co-Chair Barrell outlined the GCOS Cooperation Mechanism, which  identifies the most effective use of existing resources for  improving global observing systems of climate in developing  countries. INDIA, supported by the G-77/CHINA, suggested including  reference to the WMO principles for free data exchange, while the  US cautioned against referring to principles established under any  one specific organization. MALI, for the G-77/China, noted the  need for guidance to the GEF regarding sustaining infrastructure.  He also stressed the importance of implementing regional action  plans. The EU, supported by SWITZERLAND, encouraged digitalizing  historical data. CANADA suggested inviting the Group on Earth  Observations (GEO) to prioritize work on climate monitoring, and  the US proposed requesting GCOS and GEO to coordinate their work.  CHILE stressed the need to call on national governments to provide  financial resources to national meteorological authorities.

# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates heard a  presentation by CGE Chair Brian Challenger (Antigua and Barbuda)  on the proposed work programme of the CGE for 2003-7. Participants  discussed the distribution of regional experts within each of the  thematic groups of the CGE, and funding for workshops. The US,  supported by the EU, suggested that workshops be organized based  on status of preparation of communications, rather than on  regions. Draft conclusions were distributed for discussion at the  next contact group meeting.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This group was chaired by Dechen Tsering  (Bhutan). On actions and steps to complete the comprehensive  review of the implementation of the framework for capacity  building in developing countries, Parties discussed a request to  the Secretariat to produce a technical paper on lessons learned.  The G-77/CHINA, supported by the EU, stressed the importance of  the Secretariat also considering gaps and shortfalls in  implementing the framework.

The EU emphasized the importance of determining capacity-building  needs of developing countries. SWITZERLAND suggested drawing on  work undertaken by UNDP and the GEF, and noted the importance of  ensuring consistency between work done under the GEF and UNFCCC.  Parties agreed that the technical paper should be reviewed by  governments.

JAPAN and SWITZERLAND suggested postponing further guidance to the  GEF until the comprehensive review is completed. Delegates agreed  to request the GEF to report on progress made on its strategic  approach to enhance capacity building. Chair Tsering said informal  consultations will be held to prepare a draft COP decision.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET

Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) emphasized  the group's tasks of determining the budget level and addressing  the Secretariat's proposal for an interim funding allocation for  the entry into force of the Protocol. On the options for the  budget, the EU supported a 9% increase, while Japan supported zero  nominal growth. Regarding the interim allocation, the EU said it  regards this proposal as a positive attempt to give certainty and  security to the financing of the Protocol, while JAPAN said these  costs should be included in the Supplemental Trust Fund, not in  the core budget. The US said Protocol-related developmental  activities, particularly those related to the cooperative  mechanims, should be shifted to the Supplemental Trust Fund or to  the proposal for the interim allocation. AUSTRALIA urged that  Protocol-related activities be funded by Parties to the Protocol  only, and included in a separate budget and trust fund.

### SCCF

Co-Chairs Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Frode Neergaard  (Denmark) opened the session, noting their task to prepare  conclusions and a draft COP decision. The EU and CANADA stressed  the need to build on SBI-18 conclusions, and the G-77/CHINA said  the work should be based on its submission to SBI-18. Several  countries underlined the priority of financing projects in line  with agreed decisions on adaptation and technology transfer.  COLOMBIA, with PERU, proposed categorizing projects as small,  medium or large scale. The G-77/CHINA underscored the importance  of addressing sources of finance and mechanisms for dispersal. The  EU said that the SCCF should support mainstreaming adaptation  activities. PAKISTAN highlighted the importance of financing  enabling environments for renewable energy, and, in particular,  for areas not addressed by the GEF. MICRONESIA underscored the  need for expedited access, and SOUTH AFRICA said the level of  funding to ensure the sustainability of the SCCF needs to be  addressed. UGANDA emphasized that the SCCF should not affect the  level of funding available for the LDC Fund.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With the contact group on the SCCF underway, and negotiations on  the Secretariat's programme budget picking up pace, some observers  decided to call Wednesday the 'show us the money' day. This had  probably less to do with the contact group discussions, and more  to do with the informal meeting of delegates attempting to figure  out their burden sharing arrangements to implement their 'strong  political commitment to climate change funding for developing  countries, ' made over two years ago during COP-6 part II.  Meanwhile in New York, negotiations took place in the second  committee of the UNGA on a request to fund UNFCCC conference  services from the regular UN budget, which according to one  delegate is expected to result in a precedent-setting vote later  today.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### COP PLENARY

The COP will meet in Plenary I at 10:00 am, and again  at 3:00 pm, to address the review of implementation of commitments  and of other provisions of the UNFCCC, Annex I national  communications, and the report of the CDM EB.

### CONTACT GROUPS

Contact groups of the SBSTA and SBI will meet to  address LULUCF good practice guidance, the IPCC TAR,  methodological work under the UNFCCC and Protocol, technology  transfer, the programme budget, and the SCCF.
