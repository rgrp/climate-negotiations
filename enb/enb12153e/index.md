Participants then considered organizational matters,  adopted the meeting's agenda, and heard general statements by  delegates."
---

The thirteenth sessions of the UNFCCC subsidiary bodies resumed  late afternoon in a joint session to consider adverse effects, the  Protocol mechanisms, a compliance regime, and capacity building.  The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice  (SBSTA) convened in the evening to consider several agenda items,  including land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF),  guidelines under Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), and  policies and measures. The Subsidiary Body for Implementation  (SBI) addressed organizational matters, national communications,  the financial mechanism, and administrative and financial matters.  In addition, contact groups met to discuss the mechanisms and  technology transfer.

# WELCOMING CEREMONY

The Welcoming Ceremony began at 10:00 am with the arrival of Her  Majesty Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands. COP-6 President- designate Jan Pronk welcomed participants. Noting the 'unmatched  success' achieved by negotiators at Kyoto in reaching agreement on  quantified emissions targets, he said COP-6 participants face the  greater challenge of agreeing on the instruments and details to  achieve these targets. He noted that developing countries are the  least culpable for problems resulting from climate change and have  the least economic resilience, yet will suffer the most  devastating consequences. While acknowledging the significant  differences between countries' positions on key issues, he said  that reasonable compromises are possible on all issues, and urged  delegates to take principled, balanced and credible decisions.

Wim Deetman, Mayor of The Hague, expressed the hope that this  would become the city where history will be made in the  development of climate change management. He particularly welcomed  young participants and said it was important that their voices are  heard. Delegates then listened to readings by Dutch actor Aus  Greidanus of short quatrains on climate change written by Dutch  national poet Gerrit Komrij.

In a pre-recorded video message to delegates, United Nations  Secretary General Kofi Annan stated that the task of reducing  greenhouse gas emissions was enormous, and would require 'radical  change.' He said success would require a credible rulebook on  climate change, a new path and commitment to development, and a  convincing signal to the business community that reducing  greenhouse gases is in their best interests. He drew attention to  support at the recent United Nations Millennium Summit for every  effort to be made to bring the Kyoto Protocol into force by 2002.

Robert Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC), described the current state of scientific  understanding of the Earth's climate system, highlighted the  vulnerability of ecological systems, and underlined the need for  effective policy and technological responses. Noting that the last  two decades have been the warmest in 1000 years, he said the  question is no longer whether the climate is changing in response  to human activities, but rather how much, how fast, and where. He  noted a projected increase in global mean surface temperatures of  about 1.5oC - 6oC by 2100 (almost double the previous IPCC  predictions), an increase in sea levels, and increases in the  frequency and magnitude of the El Nino effect, and outlined the  negative implications of these increases for water resources,  agriculture, natural ecosystems and human health. He highlighted  anticipated decreases in precipitation in existing arid areas and  underlined the likely increase in insect-borne vector diseases.  Underlining the need to decarbonize the economy, he urged  governments to undertake significant technological and policy  responses, and in particular to promote increased public and  private sector research and development.

# OPENING PLENARY

### OPENING STATEMENTS AND ELECTION OF COP-6 PRESIDENT

Jan Szyszko,  President of COP-5, opened COP-6, stating that it was possible to  reach agreement and ensure that the Protocol entered into effect  before the end of 2002, but that many difficult issues had still  to be resolved. He expressed his gratitude to those who had  provided assistance during his presidency.

Jan Pronk, Minister of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment  of the Netherlands, was elected President of COP-6. He reaffirmed  his commitment to ensuring that the interests of all delegations  will be served by the UNFCCC.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar drew attention  to the evidence presented by Robert Watson, and underscored that  action to deal with climate change cannot be delayed. He said  developing countries should feel supported in their efforts to  address climate change and its impacts, and all Parties should  consider the Protocol to be ratifiable. He said substantive  results should be reached during the first week of COP-6 so  political agreements could be sealed by mid-next week, allowing  technical drafting to take place before close of the meeting.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Status of ratification of the Convention  and its Kyoto Protocol: COP-6 noted that the UNFCCC now has 183  Parties, and invited the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to  participate in its work as an Observer.

### Adoption of the rules of procedure:

President Pronk said there was  still no consensus on draft rule 42 (voting). COP-6 decided to  apply the draft rules with the exception of this provision.

### Adoption of the agenda:

COP-6 then adopted its agenda, with the  exception of item 5 'Second review of adequacy of Article 4.2 (a)  and (b) of the Convention' that the G-77/China has proposed to  amend as 'review of the adequacy of implementation of Article 4,  paragraph 2 (a) and (b) of the Convention'. President Pronk said  he would consult on this issue.

### GENERAL STATEMENTS

NIGERIA, on behalf of the G-77/CHINA, said  COP-6 discussions should be based on equity and justice. Noting  that many Annex I Parties had not fulfilled their UNFCCC  commitments on reducing emissions or on technology transfer and  financial assistance, he said his group rejected the proposal by a  'key Annex I country' tying the provision of financial assistance  for developing countries to some form of new emissions reduction  commitment by these countries. He urged provision of funding  through a mechanism other than the GEF.

SAMOA, speaking for AOSIS, said that despite the adoption of the  precautionary principle in 1992, Annex I countries are yet to act  to address climate change. FRANCE, on behalf of the EU, stressed  that domestic actions should be the main means for fulfilling  developed country commitments.

SWITZERLAND, on behalf of the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP, said  the CDM should be based on an incremental approach, that JI should  follow a two-track approach, and that liability under emissions  trading should be linked to the nature and scope of the  enforcement branch of the compliance regime. On sinks, he opposed  credits for the natural uptake of greenhouse gases.

VANUATU, on behalf of the LDCs, called for assistance in  implementing the UNFCCC and Protocol, and the CENTRAL AFRICAN  REPUBLIC urged a specific decision on UNFCCC Article 4.9 (adverse  effects on LDCs). KAZAKHSTAN reaffirmed its will to become an  Annex I Party and called for no limits on emissions trading.

# JOINT MEETING OF THE SUBSIDIARY BODIES

SBSTA Chair Harald Dovland (Norway) opened the first joint resumed  meeting of the subsidiary bodies. He said the Chairs of contact  groups held at SB-13 Part I would resume their tasks, and  requested reports on recent consultations and workshops held since  SB-13 Part I.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Bo Kjell√©n (Sweden), Co-Chair of the contact  group on UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14  (adverse effects), said progress had been made in recent  consultations, in particular on Article 4.9, following the outcome  of a workshop for LDCs.

### COMPLIANCE

Neroni Slade (Samoa), Co-Chair of the Joint Working  Group on compliance (JWG), reported that informal consultations  had provided an opportunity for delegates to examine the  consequences of non-compliance, as well as the approaches for the  adoption of the compliance procedures and mechanisms. He said a  revised text had been prepared that would serve as a basis for the  negotiations.

### MECHANISMS

Contact Group Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) said new  text had been elaborated drawing on views expressed at SB-13 Part  I, subsequent submissions by Parties, and during bilateral and  multilateral consultations. He also noted that joint consultations  on cross-cutting issues had been held with the compliance group.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Chair Dovland recalled that the subsidiary  bodies had agreed to continue consideration of the issue on the  basis of two draft decisions, one for countries with economies in  transition and one for developing countries.

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY (AIJ)

On AIJ under the pilot  phase, Chair Dovland said Parties had agreed to defer  consideration of the draft revised uniform reporting format to SB- 14. He noted, however, that there may be need for a decision  depending on the outcome of negotiations on mechanisms, and asked  Chair Chow to consult on a possible draft COP-6 decision.

# SBSTA

### LULUCF

Contact group Co-Chair Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland)  reported on recent informal consultations. He identified  outstanding issues to be resolved, including definitions,  accounting and reporting, interlinkages with work on Protocol  Articles 5,7 and 8 and potentially Articles 6 and 12, and a  possible limitation on credits.

Chair Dovland noted that the chairs of the contact groups on  LULUCF and the mechanisms will consult informally on the  relationship between LULUCF and the CDM, and report back to the  COP President's coordination meeting on how to proceed.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Contact group Co-Chair Helen Plume  (New Zealand) reported on progress made at SB-13 Part I, as well  as at informal consultations held in October. She said a number of  difficult issues and technical details remained unresolved.  Without pre-judging the number of decisions to be adopted, she  added that her aim was to complete the guidelines under Articles 7  and 8, and prepare draft decisions on Articles 5.1 (national  systems), 5.2 (adjustments), 7 and 8.

### IMPACT OF SINGLE PROJECTS ON EMISSIONS IN THE COMMITMENT PERIOD

Chair Dovland reminded delegates of the draft decision proposed by  Iceland at COP-4 and said further work would be conducted in a  contact group.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Chair Dovland said the  contact group chaired by Jean Cooper (Canada) and Oladapo Afolabi  (Nigeria) formed at SB-13 Part I will continue its deliberations.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Chair Dovland noted that SBSTA had agreed  to continue consideration of the elements on a draft decision on  'best practices' in policies and measures. He said further  consultations would be held.

### OTHER MATTERS

On international aviation bunker fuels, the  International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) reported that  activities in response to Protocol Article 2.2 (reduction of  bunker emissions) were underway. He said an expert group within  ICAO has initiated actions aimed at providing the technical and  economic policy basis for decisions on limiting or reducing  greenhouse gases that could be taken by the ICAO Council. He  requested SBSTA/COP decisions not to preclude the participation by  international aviation in the Kyoto mechanisms. SAUDI ARABIA  objected to the report, stating that it was yet to be finalized  and adopted by ICAO, and was based on the findings of a very  limited group with experts mainly from Annex I countries. Chair  Dovland said he would consult on wording for the conclusions.

### COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The Global Climate Observing System Secretariat  presented its progress report, highlighting, inter alia: the  significant developments on ocean and terrestrial sequestration  observation systems; and the organization of regional workshops to  identify developing countries' capacity building needs.

The Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity  introduced a note on the cooperation with the UNFCCC. He said  collaboration falls into two main areas: impacts of climate change  on biodiversity and consideration of response measures; and  integration of biodiversity considerations in implementing the  UNFCCC and its Protocol.

# SBI

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

SBI Chair John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda)  opened the meeting and introduced documents containing greenhouse  gas inventory data from Annex I Parties for 1990-98, and on the  progress of the in-depth review of Annex I Parties' second  national communications.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Provision of financial and technical  support: Chair Ashe introduced a document on the financial support  provided by the GEF to non-Annex I Parties in preparating their  national communications. MAURITANIA, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed  that lack of funding and support for inventory compilation and  national communications significantly influenced accuracy of the  data and the rate at which progress was being made.

In addition, a representative of the Consultative Group of Experts  reported on outcomes of the second meeting of the Group and, with  Mexico, emphasized the importance of continuing the UNDP/GEF  National Communication Support Programme. The Secretariat  introduced its Second compilation and synthesis of non-Annex I  Parties' initial national communications.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Chair Ashe introduced documents containing a  report of the GEF to COP-6 on its activities under the financial  mechanism, and a review by the GEF of its climate change enabling  activities. The G-77/CHINA said this review was the function of  the COP, that it had not been requested, and that the funding used  should have gone to developing countries. LEBANON said the review  had fulfilled its objective, and supported the recommendation that  the GEF guidelines be more flexible. SWITZERLAND said the review  of the GEF's enabling activities was a high quality report that is  strong on findings and recommendations. Regarding guidance on the  financial mechanism, Chair Ashe said this issue had been  considered at SB-13 Part I, and consultations would resume later  this week.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

On late payment of  contributions, Chair Ashe noted that informal consultations had  been held, but further consideration would be postponed until SB- 14, given the amount of work during COP-6. He also noted that a  document had been prepared outlining the latest status of  financial contributions.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### MECHANISMS

Delegates considered the recently revised Chairs' text  developed following the recent intersessional consultations. On  the draft decision and rules relating to the CDM, discussions  focused predominantly on the issue of including sinks. BOLIVIA and  COSTA RICA requested Chair Chow to formally seek technical advice  from the LULUCF contact group. TUVALU, SAMOA and the FEDERATED  STATES OF MICRONESIA urged postponing discussions until the  remaining uncertainties relating to LULUCF had been addressed.  Objecting to the tactic of pressing for a discussion on sinks so  as to gain a negotiating advantage, BRAZIL argued that the issue  could only be addressed once key aspects had been resolved in the  LULUCF contact group.

On other CDM issues, SAUDI ARABIA recalled that several Parties  had objected to a prompt start. NORWAY, AUSTRALIA and the US  highlighted the need to streamline the text on participation. The  US underlined the issue of baselines. The EU urged streamlining  text on validation particularly as regards baselines.

On JI, the US and AUSTRALIA urged inclusion of the CDM text on  baselines and additionality. INDIA, CHINA and BRAZIL recommended  inclusion of a clear definition on assigned amounts, and, opposed  by the US, suggested deleting the existing reference to assigned  amount units. INDIA recommended definitions on transfer and  acquisition. SAMOA and MAURITANIA urged specific reference to the  share of proceeds assisting LDCs and Small Island Developing  States.

On emissions trading, CANADA and AUSTRALIA argued that the chapeau  decisions should be brief and reflect Protocol and UNFCCC  provisions. The US, AUSTRALIA and CANADA argued that decision text  relating to verification and accountability procedures for legal  entities should be addressed by the contact group on Articles 5,7  and 8. On registries, INDIA, opposed by the US, argued that there  was no need for a separate addendum.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

This contact group resumed  deliberations on the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5  (development and transfer of technology). Delegates heard brief  reports of the three regional workshops held during 1999 as part  of the consultative process.

Delegates presented their views on the five themes outlined in the  draft framework: technology needs assessment, technology  information, enabling environments, capacity building and a  technology transfer mechanism. The US, NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND,  AUSTRALIA, CANADA and JAPAN jointly presented proposals on each of  the key themes.

The G-77/CHINA and others said the draft text was very weak and  proposed basing discussion on its proposal for a draft decision,  submitted at SB-13 Part I.

The US, on behalf of NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, CANADA and  JAPAN, announced that this group would submit a proposal for a  draft decision. Co-Chair Afolabi said a draft revised text taking  into account Parties' proposals for a draft decision and the  comments presented in the meeting will be available on 14  November.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As negotiations enter their final round, delegates pondered over   how to reconcile the time pressures with the expectation of a  positive outcome by the conclusion of COP-6.  While President  Pronk reminded delegates Monday that 'time is scarce,' some  delegations have been pushing for greater transparency, reminding  colleagues that this is a guarantor of an equitable and just  outcome. Others, however, recall the frantic final days of COP-3  in Kyoto and are tempted to trade inclusiveness for manageability.  As one delegate put it: 'can the process be so transparent that it  becomes invisible,' thus failing to reach a satisfactory  conclusion?
