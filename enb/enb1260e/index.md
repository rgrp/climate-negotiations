abstract: "Delegates to the eighth session of the Ad Hoc Group on the  Berlin Mandate (AGBM-8) met in 'non-group' sessions on  quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives  (QELROs), advancing the implementation of Article 4.1 and  institutions, mechanisms and compliance. The Subsidiary  Body for Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA-7) held an  informal meeting with the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change (IPCC). The Chair of the AGBM conducted a  briefing for observers on the progress of negotiations."

# OBSERVER BRIEFING

AGBM Chair Raúl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) reported that  AGBM-8 delegates should focus on producing consensus, but  noted that many were still 'playing games with brackets.'  He also said that a new 'non-group' (QELROs-2) chaired by  Bo Kjellén (Sweden) was established to address some aspects  of QELROs, as well as articles related to, inter alia,  emissions trading, joint implementation, voluntary  commitments, review of national communications and review  of commitments. The non-group Chairs gave brief statements  on the upcoming work of their groups.

Responding to questions regarding the US position,  announced by President Clinton on Wednesday, he noted that  a number of questions would need to be answered. He  characterized the position as a 'modest' offer but said he  was impressed that the US President had taken up the issue  himself. He said the outcome will depend upon the reaction  of other delegations, but noted that a position issued from  a Head of State does not leave much room for flexibility.

NON-GROUP ON QELROs-1 The US introduced its position as announced by President  Clinton on Wednesday. The position contained three  elements. The US will commit to a binding target of  returning emissions to 1990 levels in a budget period  between 2008 and 2012, to reducing net emissions of all  GHGs below 1990 levels in the five-year period thereafter  (between 2013 and 2018), and working for further reductions  in the years beyond that. It also called for a series of  flexible market mechanisms, including emissions trading and  joint implementation. The US will not assume binding  obligations unless key developing countries meaningfully  participate. He said this position reflects the fact that  if the entire industrialized world reduces emissions while  developing countries continue to grow at their current  pace, GHG concentrations will continue to climb.

The US also recalled that President Clinton announced a  domestic program, including a US$5 billion series of tax  incentives and research investments to encourage energy  efficiency and the use of cleaner energy. He also proposed  the creation of a domestic market-based system for reducing  emissions that will tie national efforts into a global  emissions market.

On the discussion of the consolidated negotiating text,  there was agreement that 'each' of the Annex I Parties  would take on commitments regarding targets. Delegates  discussed whether Annex I Parties would 'reduce,' 'limit'  or 'stabilize' anthropogenic emissions of GHGs with a 'net'  or 'aggregate' approach and whether they would do it  individually or jointly. A regional group favored reducing  or limiting emissions of GHGs jointly and with an aggregate  approach, but met objection from one country. A group of  countries proposed that commitments for Annex I Parties be  spelled out within the text instead of appearing in an  attachment.

# NON-GROUP ON INSTITUTIONS AND MECHANISMS

Delegates in the non-group on institutions and mechanisms  agreed that there was no need to recapitulate elements from  the FCCC in the preamble. On the article listing  definitions, delegates agreed to delete text on the role of  the Meeting of the Parties. A regional group introduced a  new draft article based on the IPCC's scientific findings.  Non-group Chair Takao Shibata (Japan) invited a number of  delegations to consult on a substantive proposal to insert  references to the FCCC objectives in the negotiating text.  There was some resistance to a follow-up suggestion that  the negotiating text also refer to FCCC principles. Of the  two proposals contained in the negotiating text on the  senior body to oversee the Protocol, the alternative which  describes the Conference of the Parties as the supreme body  of the Protocol attracted most support. The Chair offered  to incorporate a number of points raised by one delegation  into a fresh version of the preferred text. There was  general support for institutional economy through which the  existing institutions serve the purposes of the Protocol,  and negotiators will endeavor to detail any new COP  functions arising from new responsibilities.

# NON-GROUP ON ARTICLE 4.1

The non-group on advancing existing commitments in Article  4.1 chaired by Evans King (Trinidad and Tobago) met in the  morning and discussed the chapeau and second paragraph of  the AGBM Chair's draft. There was some support for adding a  reference to common but differentiated responsibilities.   Delegates could not agree on whether to advance commitments  'in accordance with' Convention Articles 4.3, 4.5 and 4.7  as favored by developing countries or 'taking into account'  those articles as proposed by developed countries.  Delegates disagreed about a portion of a consensus text  offered by the non-group Chair in which parties would work  toward sustainable development. A delegation suggested  replacing the chapeau with Convention and Berlin Mandate  language.

On three sub-paragraphs describing national inventories and  related methodologies and cooperation, delegates debated  whether the text constituted a new commitment for  developing countries or was a clarification of existing  common but differentiated commitments. A regional group  suggested combining sub-paragraphs on inventories or  methodologies. Another group suggested replacement text for  all three. A delegation proposed deleting all references to  the Convention and to financial resources. A small group  was convened in the evening to try to address the various  recommendations.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVICE

Dr. Robert Watson introduced a paper containing 16  decisions of the IPCC taken at its September meeting. He  noted that the Third Assessment Report (TAR) would cover a  range of scientific, technical, economic and social issues.  It will consist of reports of IPCC Working Groups I  (scientific aspects), II (vulnerability of systems) and III  (mitigation), and will focus heavily on regional aspects.  The three Working Group reports, which will be approved by  late 2000 or early 2001, will be integrated into a policy  relevant Synthesis Report, which will be completed by the  second quarter of 2001.

The Synthesis Report will be written in a non-technical  style suitable for policymakers and will address a broad  range of key policy relevant questions. The IPCC Chair and  the Working Group Co-Chairs will develop these questions in  consultation with the President of the COP and chairs of  other FCCC bodies. The questions will be circulated to  governments for comment, and the IPCC will approve them at  its Fourteenth Session.

The IPCC also took decisions on enhancing participation of  experts from developing countries and countries with  economies in transition, as well as business and  development organizations. Other decisions related to:  scope of the working groups and nominations of lead  authors; peer-review process for the Working Group Reports  and the TAR; the editorial review process; utilization of  non-English language literature; the structure of the IPCC  Bureau; publication and translation procedures; and the  financial task team.

SBSTA delegates asked a number of questions regarding IPCC  decisions, such as: whether the IPCC would consider  developing an overall environmental objective for the FCCC  processes; whether existing long-term observation and  satellite systems were adequate; and whether the IPCC  deadlines for comments were flexible. Other questions  raised were: whether the 'business as usual' scenario  changes by applying IPCC recommendations; what impact would  developing countries' actions have in changing it; and  whether reducing emissions sooner rather than later would  'buy' greater climatic resilience and certainty.

On the TAR, delegates asked: whether uncertainties in  projections and conclusions would be addressed; whether  research methodologies and techniques would be adequately  spelled out; and whether several options and scenarios  would be included to allow the reader to draw her own  conclusions. Delegates also asked whether: the TAR would  include adaptation options and impacts, particularly for  developing countries; rely heavily on numerical models or  use historical models as well; whether the synthesis report  would address policy questions made by SBSTA; would the  link, if any, between 'El Niño' and global warming be  addressed; and how would IPCC and SBSTA coordinate their  schedules to ensure that TAR was sufficiently informed by  SBSTA.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Reactions to the US positions were the order of the day in  the corridors. Some 'disappointed' EU delegates agreed with  many of the facts underlying the US position, but said  these facts were not properly reflected in the proposed  targets. Recalling that the IPCC science calls for early  action and indicates the need for significant reductions  below 1990 levels, many said the US target, which is even  lower than Japan's 'inadequate' target, is a 'long way'  from this and intensive dialogue with all Parties was  needed.

Some developing countries delegates were not surprised by  the US position and said the G-77/China proposal was  intended to counter-balance it. One developing country  observer noted that the US, in promoting its containment  policies, has played several unilateral cards worldwide as  of late and speculated that inflexibility in this forum  could lead to failure. Another said that no protocol is  better than a protocol with new developing country  commitments.

Environmental NGOs have begun preparing their strategic  response, determined to 'salvage' the AGBM process and  ensure that a reported 'celebration' by the business lobby  on Wednesday evening was premature. Given the high-level  nature of the US announcement, NGOs will focus their  efforts on attempts to convince other Heads of State, such  as British Prime Minister Blair and Germany's Chancellor  Kohl to engage the White House. Japan will also face  intense lobbying, as some NGOs have suggested that the host  government for COP-3 had paved the way for the US  announcement with its own 'extremist' position.

The AGBM process is set to continue along parallel  negotiating tracks, with 'megaphone diplomacy' punctuating  the formal talks in Bonn and beyond. One NGO speaker  underlined his colleagues' determination to pursue the  negotiators to the bitter end in December, with the thought  that 'it's not over til the fat lady sings.'
