# PLENARY

At the opening of the Plenary, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael  Zammit Cutajar called for political imagination over expediency,  urged a focus not only on national interests but also on the  common good, and said he hoped COP-6 would reach a 'sweet rather  than bitter end.' Youth representatives from Kenya and the UK then reported on the  previous week's international Youth Conference attended by 118  young people from 61 countries, and urged all delegates to read  and address the Youth Declaration. The two representatives  recommended the inclusion of youth representation within  environmental councils, underlined the role of women, and called  for the establishment of a regular World Youth Meeting on Climate  Change.

### STATEMENTS BY PARTIES

Delegates then heard formal statements by  high-level representatives from more than 70 Parties, outlining  positions and views on climate change negotiations and issues  related to the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol.

<Editor's Note: A complete collection of Plenary statements will  soon be available online at: http://COP6.unfccc.int>

###     Ratification of the Protocol:

The EU, VISEGRAD GROUP, and numerous  others supported ratification and entry into force of the Protocol  in 2002. MEXICO noted that it was the only one of the world's  fifteen largest economies to have ratified the Protocol. NEW  ZEALAND said it was the first country belonging to the Umbrella  Group that had announced its firm intention to ratify in 2002.  Invoking the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities, BOLIVIA said it was unfair at this stage to make  ratification dependent on additional actions taken by developing  countries.

### UNFCCC and Protocol Commitments:

The G-77/CHINA expressed concern  that most Annex I countries have failed to implement their  commitments. With several other developing countries, he  underlined the need for Annex I Parties to fulfil their  obligations in protecting the climate system on the basis of  equity and in accordance with the principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities. The issue of equity was supported  by the UK. INDIA called for equal per capita entitlements between  countries in terms of greenhouse gases to be the aim.

The US stated that success of the Protocol requires the  involvement of all countries. He said that whereas the US is  willing to be flexible in its positions, it will not compromise  its principles aimed at ensuring that the implementation of the  Protocol is achieved in a cost effective way, while ensuring  environmental integrity.

### Policies and Measures (P&Ms):

DENMARK called for the strengthening  of international cooperation for developing and applying effective  P&Ms, and said those with negative impacts on greenhouse gas  emissions should be phased out.

### Kyoto Mechanisms:

Many countries reiterated the need for the  mechanisms to be supplemental to domestic action. The VISEGRAD  GROUP supported a quantified ceiling on the use of mechanisms,  with preferential projects under Joint Implementation. IRELAND,  ITALY, GERMANY and SLOVENIA stressed domestic action as the main  means of meeting Protocol commitments.

CANADA advocated for maximum flexibility in the use of mechanisms  to ensure that the necessary resources are provided. FINLAND said  the mechanisms must be transparent and reliable and not be a tool  for printing 'forged money' for environmental credits.

On the CDM, COSTA RICA, BOLIVIA and SENEGAL, opposed by IRELAND  and AUSTRIA, favored including sinks in the CDM. INDONESIA said  sinks could be eligible if carbon sequestration is real and  measurable.

NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, AUSTRIA, HONDURAS and COSTA RICA said nuclear  power should not be permitted within the CDM. SAMOA said the CDM  should promote investments on environmentally-safe renewable  energy technologies. JAPAN said that developing countries'  judgment of what constitutes sustainable development should not be  overruled by limiting the types of eligible activities under the  CDM.

A number of countries supported an early start for the CDM.  MOROCCO said the CDM should not be used as a channel for exporting  obsolete technologies from North to South.

### Compliance:

JAPAN said disagreements over the compliance regime  should not delay the Protocol's entry into force. NORWAY said a  firm compliance regime is essential to ensure that the Protocol  and its mechanisms will work. SAMOA, BRAZIL, INDONESIA and  LUXEMBOURG called for strong and enforceable rules and procedures  that penalize non-compliance.

### LULUCF

JAMAICA strongly supported an internationally-defined  biome-based approach for forests. SAMOA and MICRONESIA argued that  countries should be prohibited from offsetting their obligations  through activities that are neither measurable nor permanent.  JAPAN said it was essential not to lose the incentives for  appropriate sink activities. BOLIVIA said reduction credits  resulting from natural variability should be avoided and that  carbon accounting systems should be able to distinguish between  human efforts and natural reductions. NORWAY said that  contribution from sinks should be limited in the first commitment  period. DENMARK argued that the inclusion of sinks should avoid  the crediting of projects that would have happened in any case.

CAMBODIA said the use of sinks is not an equally sustainable  alternative in mitigating climate change. KENYA said though the  benefits of land use activities are undeniable, including them in  the CDM is likely to be counter-productive.

### Capacity building and technology transfer:

Many speakers stressed  that issues such as technology transfer, capacity building, and  adverse effects had to be recognized and addressed, with special  attention given to the least developed countries (LDCs) and those  most vulnerable to climate change. CHINA and several other  developing countries stated that agreement at The Hague was  contingent on 'developing country' issues receiving their due  recognition. Many developing countries stressed the need for new  and additional resources.

The SUDAN noted reluctance by developed country Parties to  implement their commitments in relation to the provision of  finance, transfer of technology and scientific knowledge to  developing countries. BOTSWANA said the reason for the slow  implementation of the UNFCCC by developing countries is due to  lack of capacity. PARAGUAY said technology transfers should not in  any way be discriminatory, and should not exclude local  technologies.

### Adverse effects:

Issues relating to the adverse effects of climate  change and the impacts of response measures were highlighted by a  number of countries. IRAN voiced its concern over the current  energy policies of industrialized countries that generate market  imperfections. SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern over the impacts of  response measures will have, and supported a compensation fund to  assist countries whose economies would be affected by the  implementation of response measures.

### Funding / GEF:

The need for additional resources to support  developing countries to cope with climate change was highlighted  by many speakers. Noting the need to reform the GEF, CANADA called  for the creation of a 'window' within the GEF to deal with special  climate change issues such as adaptation. BENIN said the GEF  should be equipped with additional resources. DENMARK called on  the GEF to be more responsive to LDCs' needs and proposed support  equivalent to 0.1% of Gross National Products in additional funds.  JAPAN said the widest possible range of resources should be  mobilized, including ODA to ensure equitable distribution of CDM  projects.

The UK recognized the value of an adaptation fund and technology  transfer, and expressed a preference for an improved and enhanced  GEF with a 50% increase in contributions. MOROCCO said an  adaptation fund should be funded from financial sanctions in case  of non-compliance and, with SENEGAL, added that the three  mechanisms should feed into it.

### Economies in transition (EITs):

FINLAND said a comprehensive  negotiation package should also address the concerns of EITs.  ARMENIA said EITs have a particular challenge in moving toward a  market economy without increasing their greenhouse gas emissions  and said this transition should be guided by the principles of  sustainable development.

### Other issues:

NORWAY and the UK referred to the recent weather  events in Europe as a sign of climate change. On activities  implemented jointly, MALAWI noted Africa's limited experience and  called for a continuation of the pilot phase.

### Adjournment of the meeting:

Following a request to Plenary earlier  in the evening by President Pronk - which he indicated had been  endorsed by Ministers - interpretation services for the formal  session ended at 9:00p.m, with interpreters moving to cover  parallel informal high-level negotiations. Several delegates,  including the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and SPAIN, objected to the  removal of interpretation services. The Plenary was therefore  adjourned until Wednesday morning, when formal statements by  Parties will resume.

# INFORMAL HIGH-LEVEL PLENARY

President Pronk opened the meeting, and suggested organizing the  work according to the following four 'boxes' that cluster issues  based on previous discussions: (i) capacity building, technology  transfer, adverse effects, and guidance to the GEF; (ii)  mechanisms; (iii) LULUCF; and (iv) P&Ms, compliance and  accounting, and reporting and review under Protocol Articles 5, 7  and 8.

He said he would chair the informal high-level plenary sessions,  and that after hearing statements on the issues in each 'box' a  smaller informal group would be formed, chaired by ministers.   Discussions in the informal Plenary would then proceed to the next  'box.' The informal groups would report back to the informal  Plenary when their discussions had been completed.

### CAPACITY BUILDING, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, ADVERSE EFFECTS, AND  GUIDANCE TO THE GEF

VANUATU advocated for a fund for LDCs that do  not have ready access to GEF funds.  He requested the inclusion of  the new text on LDCs in the decision(s) on UNFCCC Article 4.8 and  4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14. SAUDI ARABIA supported two separate  decisions on Article 4.8 and 4.9, and Article 3.14, with mandatory  language. The US supported one decision for both and, with JAPAN,  opposed compensation for adverse effects.

BULGARIA, for CENTRAL GROUP ELEVEN, and supported by the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION, CHINA and KAZAKHSTAN, for the GROUP OF NINE - an  alliance of Central Asian and Trans-Caucasian countries, and  Moldova - underlined that economies in transition are, like  developing countries, in need of financial aid from the GEF for  the purpose of capacity building, technology transfer and  responding to adverse effects, and requested the removal of the  brackets around text on their needs. BELIZE said that the question  of whether capacity building should be considered under adaptation  should not be difficult to resolve, and supported mandatory  language in decisions.

CANADA, with the US and EU, emphasized support for the GEF. He  recognized that developing countries might find it too slow and  therefore supported enhancing its functioning. FINLAND said the  GEF is not the only funding channel, and stressed the availability  of bilateral and private sector funds. AOSIS supported retaining  the GEF as the financial mechanism, but stated that it needed  improving and strengthening. SOUTH AFRICA opposed the 'dumping' of  unwanted technology by developed countries in developing  countries. CHINA called for concrete progress, stating that  negotiating partners are stalling.

Before breaking, President Pronk summarized the main unanswered  questions: how to give substance to the request for compensation  on Article 3.14; how to organize special facilities for LDCs; how  EITs can also benefit from funding mechanisms, technology transfer  and capacity building; whether the decision language should be  mandatory for all decisions, or only for specific issues; whether  to have one or two decisions on adverse effects; and how to  resolve questions on the role of the GEF. An informal group,  chaired by the Ministers from South Africa and Denmark and  assisted by SBI Chair John Ashe, was established.

### MECHANISMS

In the informal high-level Plenary held in the  afternoon, ministers and senior officials presented their views on  the outstanding 'crunch issues' on mechanisms identified by  President Pronk. On the issue of supplementarity, JAPAN and the US  urged against renegotiating the Protocol. While recognizing the  need for flexibility, the EU drew attention to the importance of  domestic action. INDONESIA argued in favor of requiring 70% of  emissions reductions through domestic action, with the possibility  of this being reduced under certain conditions. HUNGARY and the  AFRICA GROUP, opposed by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and AUSTRALIA,  advocated implementation of a quantitative limitation on the  flexibility mechanisms. CANADA underlined its flexibility on this  issue. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, opposed by HUNGARY and CHINA, argued  in favor of host-generated unilateral CDM projects. COLOMBIA and  BOLIVIA proposed provision for bilateral, multilateral and  unilateral CDM projects.

The EU, supported by HUNGARY, and opposed by JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, the  US, CANADA and SAUDI ARABIA, underlined its preference for a  positive list. She argued that the aim of the positive list is to  assist in getting the CDM started in support of sustainable  projects, and that the list would be subject to review. The G-77/CHINA argued that the host developing country should be the  sole judge in deciding on the project. The US expressed  flexibility on the potential for small projects, on condition that  there is no positive list and that sinks are included.

The G-77/CHINA, AFRICA GROUP and SAMOA, opposed by US, CANADA,  JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, urged the establishment of an adaptation fund  based on a levy applied to all three mechanisms. On the proposal  to levy a 'share of proceeds' on Protocol Article 6 (JI) and  Article 12 (emissions trading), the RUSSIAN FEDERATION expressed  willingness to discuss this possibility only under certain  conditions. HUNGARY said he strongly disagreed with this proposal.  JAPAN, opposed by CHINA and INDONESIA, supported using ODA funding  for the CDM.

On the composition of the Executive Board, the G-77/CHINA  emphasized the need for fair geographical representation. The US  said it could be flexible on this issue. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  argued against the creation of the Executive Board, suggesting the  Secretariat could undertake its functions. The AFRICA GROUP  expressed concern with the proposal that submission of the  national communication be a precondition for CDM participation.

On sinks in the CDM, the US, CANADA, JAPAN, COSTA RICA, AUSTRALIA,  COLOMBIA, HONDURAS and BOLIVIA, opposed by the EU, CHINA and  GHANA, argued in favor of including sinks. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION  suggested that the decision on including sinks be deferred for  possible inclusion in the next commitment period. HONDURAS, SAUDI  ARABIA and HUNGARY argued against inclusion of nuclear power in  the CDM. AUSTRALIA said this issue should be for individual  developing countries to decide, and underlined that US silence on  the matter did not necessarily indicate a lack of support for the  issue.

On emissions trading and liability, the G-77/CHINA expressed  preference for blending the 'commitment period reserve' and  'surplus units' options. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION and CANADA  supported seller liability.

An informal group chaired by the Ministers from Brazil and Japan  was established, with the assistance of the former Chair of the  contact group on mechanisms, Kok Kee Chow. Noting that in the  evening there would only be one set of interpretation facilities,  President Pronk sought the group's approval that these facilities  be used for the purpose of the informal high-level plenary.

### LULUCF

Delegates met from 9:00 pm to discuss LULUCF. The UK, for  the EU, responded to the US proposal made on Monday for phasing in  credits for activities under Article 3.4. He said the EU accepts  the concept of carbon sinks, especially forests, but, with the  CENTRAL GROUP ELEVEN and NORWAY, stressed problems associated with  permanence, uncertainty, risk, additionality and especially scale  as it relates to the Umbrella Group proposal. The US reiterated  its position on the need to include sinks during the first  commitment period and said its proposal provided flexibility and  was based on a long-term perspective. He illustrated the potential  scale of Article 3.4 activities, and said Parties have the ability  to make accurate estimates. The ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP said  it was somewhat reassured by the statement of US regarding their  proposal, and stressed the need for verifiability and  additionality. The G-77/CHINA stressed its principles on LULUCF  and the need to exclude credits for natural uptake. The US, with  JAPAN, said natural effects cannot be factored out in a  satisfactory manner, and said the effect of carbon fertilization  is well under 10%. TUVALU and ARGENTINA questioned whether a final  decision on Article 3.4 was appropriate at COP-6. An informal  group, facilitated by Mexico and Slovakia and assisted by the Co- Chairs of the LULUCF contact group, was convened.

### COMPLIANCE, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Following the completion of the LULUCF meeting at 11:20 pm, a  high-level informal Plenary meeting convened on the fourth cluster  of issues: P&Ms, compliance, and accounting, reporting and review  under Articles 5, 7 and 8. The G-77/CHINA, EU and SAUDI ARABIA  presented their respective positions on some of the issues,  highlighting the agreement reached on elements of the 'crunch  issues,' as well as noting the elements they felt were missing  from President Pronk's informal note. The meeting was adjourned at  midnight following concerns expressed by the G-77/CHINA on  availability of transportation facilities, as well as the limited  capacities of a number of its smaller delegations.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some delegates expressed concern at the pace of talks on Tuesday,  with the informal high-level discussions beginning the day bogged  down in repetitions of previously-stated positions, causing some  to question the approach taken by President Pronk. However, by  late evening, the assessment in the corridors seemed more  positive, reflecting tentative movement on the mechanisms, and the  fact that negotiations during the day had moved into smaller,  closed groups of ministers, which some judged would assist efforts  to broker deals on the key outstanding issues.

Also on a positive note, a number of participants felt that in  spite of there being little new to report on substantive issues by  late Tuesday evening, President Pronk's management style had at  least produced a more open, relaxed atmosphere that was conducive  to making progress in the remaining crucial days. President  Pronk's move to shift late night translation services from the  formal speeches in Plenary to the high-level negotiations was also  well received by some observers. They noted that although it  clearly upset some of the speakers scheduled to deliver late night  presentations on country positions in Plenary, any steps to  facilitate the actual negotiations at this crucial stage should  take priority.

On a related issue, the irony of the gradual move on Tuesday from  larger more open meetings to closed small group negotiations was  not lost on several participants, who asked whether efforts to  ensure transparency could survive negotiating realities as the  time remaining for political deal-making begins to run out.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY
