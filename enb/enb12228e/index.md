# CONTACT GROUPS

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Parties continued  consideration of draft conclusions and draft COP decisions  throughout the day. On a draft decision on submission of national  communications, the G-77/CHINA suggested text stating that  submissions shall be dependent on the availability of funding. The  EU, US and AUSTRALIA favored text requiring that second national  communications be submitted within three years of the availability  of financial resources. The G-77/CHINA underlined that it would  not discuss the issue of frequency of submissions. The US, opposed  by the G-77/CHINA, recommended text requiring non-Annex I Parties  to submit national inventories every two years. Informal  consultations continued throughout the day.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Co-Chair Jim Penman (UK) presented revised  draft conclusions. On holding a workshop on emissions projections,  the US stressed that follow-up activities should not be decided  until the workshop has been completed. Opposed by JAPAN, he said  that there must be a focus solely on fourth national  communications. SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by JAPAN, insisted that the  workshop should focus only on Annex I Parties' projections. CANADA  proposed text requesting the Secretariat to prepare a report on  the workshop for consideration at SBSTA-21.

Regarding the preparation of national greenhouse gas inventories,  the US, opposed by NORWAY, urged that a reference to Protocol  Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information) should be included.  SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern about the possibility of creating  new commitments. CANADA suggested an additional reference to  Protocol Article 5.1 (national systems). Parties agreed to delete  a paragraph noting existing and potential work. Delegates agreed  to forward the draft conclusions to SBSTA.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

Following morning informal  consultations, Parties considered a revised Co-Chairs' draft  decision in the afternoon. Addressing the initial operative  paragraphs of the text, delegates deliberated how to address views  on insurance, with the G-77/CHINA preferring to discuss 'possible  elements of a work programme on insurance,' and the US preferring  to discuss insurance and risk assessment. Parties also debated the  nature of a document containing submissions on activities in  support of the provisions of decision 5/CP.7. Discussions  continued informally throughout the day.

### SINKS IN THE CDM

In the final contact group on sinks in the CDM,  Co-Chair Thelma Krug (Brazil) presented a revised draft COP  decision resulting from informal consultations held throughout  Monday, 8 December, and into Tuesday morning, 9 December. She  welcomed technical amendments, but, with several other Parties,  urged delegates not to re-open debate and risk the 'delicate  balance' finally achieved. CANADA proposed deleting reference in  the draft decision to recognition of international 'environmental'  agreements and leaving only 'international agreements.'  SWITZERLAND, with the EU, opposed the proposal but accepted it in  the spirit of compromise. SOUTH AFRICA said he had hoped for more  stringent stakeholder involvement but appreciated the balance.  Several Parties welcomed the compromise and congratulated the Co- Chairs. The draft decision was agreed and forwarded to SBSTA for  approval.

# SBSTA PLENARY

SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson announced that Margaret Martin (Canada)  and Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago), were elected as EGTT  Chair and Vice-Chair, for 2004. TUNISIA presented the Djerba  Declaration on Tourism and Climate Change, which, inter alia,  calls for the IPCC to include tourism in its Fourth Assessment  Report.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Good Practice Guidance on LULUCF: Margaret  Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) reported on successful conclusions  in the contact group, which include recommending a common  reporting format and tables for reporting greenhouse gases  inventories under the UNFCCC. The SBSTA adopted conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.22) and agreed to forward a draft decision to  the COP (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.22/Add.1).

###     Harvested wood products

SBSTA adopted conclusions without  amendment (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.21).

###     Issues relating to registry systems under Protocol Article 7.4

Murray Ward (New Zealand) reported on informal consultations on  Protocol Article 7.4 (registries). He outlined the scope of the  draft conclusions, stressing the need for the Secretariat to focus  on developing the transaction log, urging Annex II Parties to make  'exceptional' efforts to contribute to the UNFCCC supplemental  Trust Fund, and encouraging Annex I Parties to designate their  registry administrator. SBSTA adopted the conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.20).

###     Review of methodological work under the UNFCCC and Protocol

Jim  Penman reported on the contact group's work, and Parties adopted  the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.25).

###     Greenhouse gas inventories

Helen Plume (New Zealand) reported on  the informal consultations. She said Parties had been unable to  remove all of the brackets from the draft conclusions on emissions  from fuel used for international aviation and maritime  transportation. Following discussions in Plenary, Parties agreed  to remove the brackts. SBSTA then adopted the conclusions, as  amended (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.28).

###     Sinks in the CDM

Thelma Krug reported that agreement had been  reached on a draft COP decision. Parties agreed to forward the  draft decision to the COP (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.27). AUSTRALIA  expressed concern regarding the singling out of genetically  modified organisms (GMOs) and invasive alien species (IAS), while  NORWAY expressed preference for stronger text on excluding GMOs  and IAS. CANADA underlined the need to build confidence in carbon  sinks and increase private-sector participation. NEW ZEALAND  expressed concern that the crediting period will not promote  sustainable forest management, and urged reconsideration of the  issue after 2012. The EU underlined that the text is balanced and  reflects progress toward implementing the Protocol.

###     POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms)

Greg Terrill (Australia) reported on  the informal consultations and introduced the draft conclusions,  noting that the consultations were unable to facilitate agreement.  SBSTA adopted the conclusions reflecting this  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.29).

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT ORGANIZATIONS

Outi Bergh√§ll (Finland)  reported on informal consultations. The EU said a workshop co- organized by the CCD and CBD on identifying and promoting  synergies through forest and forest ecosystems will be held in  March 2004, in Viterbo, Italy. SBSTA adopted the conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.19).

### IPCC TAR

Chair Thorgeirsson said completing work on this issue  marks a transition to work on the two new agenda items. SBSTA  adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.26), and decided to forward  the draft decision to the COP (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.26/Add.1). The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION emphasized that the TAR provides a 'scientific  basis of a global nature' applicable to all Parties.

### OTHER MATTERS

Issues relating to cleaner or less-greenhouse gas- emitting energy: Chair Thorgeirsson noted that no consensus had  been reached on issues relating to cleaner or less-greenhouse gas- emitting energy. CANADA expressed hope that progress would be made  in the future. SBSTA adopted conclusions that note that no  progress was made (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.23).

###     Issues relating to the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3

Regarding implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects  of P&Ms), Chair Thorgeirsson said there was no agreement. SBSTA  adopted the conclusions, noting lack of agreement  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.24).

###     Any other matters

# SBI PLENARY

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Dechen Tsering (Bhutan) presented a report of  the contact group's work and the SBI agreed to forward the draft  decision to the COP (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.19). JAPAN provided an  overview of its capacity-building programmes relevant to the  decision.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Fatou Ndeye Gaye (the Gambia) reported on  informal consultations and the SBI adopted the conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.3).

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

Interim financial  performance for the biennium 2002-3: Chair Stoycheva introduced a  draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.16), which the SBI agreed to  forward to the COP.

###     Programme budget for the biennium 2004-5

John Ashe (Antigua and  Barbuda) introduced the draft COP decision. He noted an amendment  to the table on estimated costs in 2004-5 for the preparatory  activities relating to the Protocol to include a line item on  programme support and the working capital reserve. ARGENTINA  expressed a reservation on the percentages applied for the  indicative scale of assessment for the programme budget for 2004-5  and for the interim allocation for the Protocol. SBI agreed to  forward the decision to the COP, as amended (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.22).

Following a clarification by the Secretariat and the EU, Chair  Stoycheva said Argentina's reservation would be noted in the SBI- 19 report. ARGENTINA and BRAZIL opposed the Secretariat's practice  of withholding financial support for the participation in UNFCCC- related meetings by Parties in arrears for more than three years,  and called for SBI conclusions correcting this practice. Noting  the importance of this issue, the US, opposed by ARGENTINA,  suggested that the SBI take this up at a future session. Chair  Stoycheva said she would undertake informal consultations on this  matter and report to the SBI on Wednesday, 10 December.

### OTHER MATTERS

Proposal by Croatia on LULUCF: Jim Penman reported  on the informal consultations and introduced draft conclusions and  a draft COP decision. ARGENTINA requested clarification of the  data used to determine the forest management value and noted  concern that this decision had taken two years to conclude. The  SBI adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.17) and agreed to  forward a draft decision to the COP (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.17/Add.1).

###     Special circumstances of Croatia under Article 4.6

Chair  Stoycheva introduced the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.18),  which the SBI adopted.

### ANY OTHER MATTERS

Chair Stoycheva introduced draft conclusions on  the intention of Belarus to use 1990 as its base year under the  UNFCCC. ARGENTINA requested clarification on whether Belarus was  applying UNFCCC Article 4.6 (flexibility for EITs), and Chair  Stoycheva said this was not the case. The SBI then adopted the  conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.21).

SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/China, requested that, pursuant to Rule  10 of the Rules of Procedure, the provisional agenda for SBI-20  and subsequent sessions should include an item on the 'continuing  review of the function and operations of the Secretariat,' and  requested that this proposal be officially noted in the report of  SBI-19. The SBI took note of the request.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With Parties scrambling to complete their work before the arrival  of ministers on Wednesday, informal consultations and contact  groups continued late into the night on Tuesday. Despite an  intense work programme, a large crowd managed to gather for the  climate-symbol fashion show in the early evening.

On another note, following years of arduous negotiations, and a  final night of intense discussion until early morning hours,  Parties finally agreed to the details of sinks projects in the  CDM. This completes one of the last outstanding issues relating to  the BAPA.
