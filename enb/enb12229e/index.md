# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

Opening the segment, COP-9 President Persányi commended delegates'  commitment to action and leadership. He noted that the UNFCCC and  its Protocol are the only viable options for preventing dangerous  interference with the global climate. Speaking on behalf of  Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Altero Matteoli, Italy's  Minister for the Environment and Territory, said the Draft Treaty  establishing a Constitution for Europe provides for EU Member  States to fulfill their obligations to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. Speaking on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan,  José Antonio Ocampo, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and  Social Affairs, encouraged Annex I Parties who have not yet  ratified the Protocol to do so as soon as possible and emphasized  the importance of the Millennium Development Goals. Joke Waller- Hunter, UNFCCC Executive Secretary, said COP-9 has demonstrated  that, in the presence of commitment and political will, it is  possible to establish sound institutional frameworks for action.

### STATEMENTS FROM HEADS OF UN AGENCIES

UNEP Executive Director  Klaus Töpfer called for financial and technical support to address  this 'ethical challenge,' which affects mostly poor people in  developing countries. José Antonio Ocampo emphasized the role of  financial mechanisms and trade in diversifying economies. Len  Good, CEO and Chair of the GEF, announced that pilot projects on  adaptation planning and measures are a new strategic priority for  the GEF, and called for clear guidance to mobilize resources for  the SCCF.

World Bank Vice-President Ian Johnson noted that both public  funding and private finance are needed to address climate change.  IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri expressed hope that participants will  find the IPCC TAR useful in their work on the UNFCCC. Hama Arba  Diallo, CCD Executive Secretary, stressed the importance of  effective implementation of the UNFCCC and CCD at the local level  to avoid duplication of work and maximize resources. Alvaro Silva  Calderon, OPEC Executive Secretary, said that the concerns of OPEC  countries over adverse effects continue to be inadequately  addressed. Kiyotaka Akasaka, OECD Deputy Secretary-General, said  OECD works with its member States to strengthen the use of market- based mechanisms to limit climate change while contributing to  sustainable economic development.

### STATEMENTS FROM INTERGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND NGOS

The  INTERNATIONAL ENERGY AGENCY stressed the importance of energy  efficiency policies and measures. The INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE OF  REFRIGERATION presented targets to halve fluorocarbon emissions by  2020. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK called on the Russian Federation to  ratify the Protocol. The BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR SUSTAINABLE ENERGY  urged the CDM EB to develop standardized baselines for energy  efficiency and renewable energy projects. A representative of the  sixth INTERNATIONAL INDIGENOUS FORUM ON CLIMATE CHANGE underscored  the need for prior informed consent and increased participation of  indigenous peoples in CDM projects. CLIMATE ALLIANCE called on  COP-9 to address the scope, role, complementarity and coherence of  local, regional and national climate policies.

WWF SOUTH PACIFIC underscored the 'devastating' effects of climate  change on SIDS. The INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE called for  rules promoting innovation and stimulating business involvement.  The GLOBAL UNIONS AND INTERNATIONAL CONFEDERATION OF FREE TRADE  UNIONS urged including employment considerations in the IPCC  reports. The LOMBARDY FOUNDATION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said  governments should rely more on local groups and associations to  undertake concrete action. The RESEARCH AND INDEPENDENT NGOs  called for global collaboration, political will, creative  thinking, and avoidance of political rhetoric. The WORLD COUNCIL  OF CHURCHES said environmental degradation is a matter of justice  and spirituality, and stressed that reducing emissions should be a  moral goal.

### ROUND-TABLE I - 'CLIMATE CHANGE, ADAPTATION, MITIGATION AND  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

This round-table was co-chaired by  Yuriko Koike, Minister of Environment, Japan, and Tadashi Lometo,  Minister of Health and Environment, Marshall Islands. Co-Chair  Koike stressed the need to analyze the current state of progress  and identify further actions. Co-Chair Lometo emphasized the  vulnerability of SIDS.

In the first part of the round-table, Parties discussed poverty  eradication, economic growth and food security. Several Parties  called for entry into force of the Protocol and sufficient  financial support for developing countries to respond to climate  change. MOROCCO, for the G-77/CHINA, said adaptation and  mitigation measures will be unsuccessful if developed countries  ignore the concerns and situation of vulnerable States. BENIN  stressed the importance of integrating poverty reduction and  adaptation measures. On reducing greenhouse gas emissions, ITALY,  for the EU, said developed countries must make a greater effort  and developing countries must also take steps towards this end.  NEW ZEALAND underlined the vulnerability of SIDS and noted threats  to island cultures. SLOVENIA, with others, said it would fulfill  its Protocol commitments in the absence of the Protocol's entry  into force. MOZAMBIQUE, with BELGUIM, called for 'more action and  less talk.' MICRONESIA called on developed countries to meet their  UNFCCC commitments relating to financing adaptation projects in  SIDS. PANAMA said adaptation should be given the same status as  mitigation under the UNFCCC.

In the second part of the round-table, Parties addressed  vulnerability, climate-related disasters, impacts and adaptation.  ARGENTINA called for a mechanism to facilitate adaptation  projects. SAMOA expressed hope that the SCCF would fund community- based adaptation projects. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION said that  remaining uncertainties regarding whether mitigation efforts will  be effective for reducing climate change justify pursuing  adaptation. BURKINA FASO questioned the purpose of NAPAs if  mechanisms for their implementation are not in place. CHINA said  once developed countries have taken the lead in mitigating  emissions, developing countries will be able to make a  contribution. AUSTRIA noted that nuclear power is not an option  for combating climate change. NEPAL said that despite his  country's insignificant contribution to climate change, efforts  toward mitigating emissions are underway.

In the third part of the round-table, delegates discussed  adaptation and mitigation in national development. FRANCE  emphasized that this century will either be recorded as the  century of climate change suffering and collective  irresponsibility or the century of climate control and the  maturing of humanity. DENMARK stressed increasing the use of  renewable energy. SAUDI ARABIA said that mitigation and adaptation  measures must not lead to new commitments for developing  countries.

In closing, ARGENTINA announced its offer to host COP-10 in Buenos  Aires.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

Following informal  consultations on the draft conclusions late Tuesday night,  delegates agreed to invite Parties and relevant international  organizations to report on activities to meet the needs of  developing countries arising from the adverse effects of climate  change. Changing its earlier support, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by the  G-77/CHINA, MICRONESIA, US, EU, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN and  CANADA, proposed adding bracketed text on reporting on actions to  address the adverse affects of response measures. Following  informal consultations, the group agreed to the draft conclusions,  without amendment, and to include Saudi Arabia's proposal in the  draft negotiating text included in the annex to the draft  conclusions.

### SCCF

Following informal consultations and bilateral meetings  throughout the day, Co-Chair Rawleston Moore presented the Co- Chairs' draft decision, noting that it was a 'take it or leave it'  text. The EU, CANADA and JAPAN, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, said  they could accept the Co-Chairs' text. The G-77/CHINA opposed the  option of a 'take it or leave it' approach, and proposed  alternative text regarding the prioritization of, and funding for,  economic diversification activities. Following a break for  informal consultations, Co-Chair Moore reported that the Co-Chairs  were unable to take the consultations further, and said the draft  decision would be forwarded to the SBI with bracketed text.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

On the sixth anniversary of the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol,  frustration over lack of progress was clear. Convening in a late  night Plenary to adopt SBI conclusions, Parties continued to  deliberate on issues not agreed to during the contact groups and  informal consultations. Observers noted that while the sinks in  the CDM issue, which was generally expected to cause the greatest  troubles at COP-9, had been resolved, the controversy of the  developing country issues had been underestimated. This was  evident both in the heated debates around the SCCF, referred to by  one delegate as 'opening Pandora's Box,' and in consideration of  non-Annex I national communications. Several shaken delegates said  the EU's lack of resistance over deferring consideration of  submission of second and, where appropriate, third national  communications to SB-20 was wholly out of line with the EU's  negotiating mandate. The surprise was equally evident among some  developing country delegates, who met this give-away of bargaining  power with concealed laughter of disbelief.
