# AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13

AG13 continued deliberations on size of the Committee and  representation. The US said that the Committee was the first  under the Convention and is not compelled to follow the UN  system of apportionment. He called for consideration of the  special obligations of Annex I and Annex II Parties who  undertake the 'lion's share of the implementation of the  Convention.' He reiterated the US position on the designation of  half the members by Annex I Parties and the other half by non- Annex I Parties and suggested brackets around 'equitable  geographical distribution.' The G-77/CHINA opposed the US  proposal saying that the group will not undermine well- established UN practices on equitable geographical distribution  and rotation principles. He said that the group was ready to  show flexibility on the size of the Committee.

The G-77/CHINA said that the introduction of new bracketed text  was unacceptable at this point. The Chair proposed that the US,  Ghana, Indonesia, Canada, Egypt and the EU form a small group to  try and resolve the issues. In the afternoon, the EU, on behalf  of the small group, reported that no consensus on the issues had  been reached. The delegates continued deliberating on the issues  and the language used in the report on the work of AG13, and the  small group reconvened again to try and resolve the two  outstanding issues. As of 8pm, no decision had been reached.

# CONTACT GROUPS

## Technology

In the contact group on technology, delegates  considered proposed draft conclusions from the Chair on  development and transfer of technology. The draft conclusions  note the results of the expanded technology and technology needs  survey. Regarding language identifying non-Annex I  communications as an important means of identifying technology  needs, debate centered on a proposal noting that a lack of  funding prevented many non-Annex I countries from submitting  their national communications. A number of developed countries  objected, noting their efforts to accelerate funding and stating  that national communications are not the only available avenue  for addressing technological needs. Several delegations also  objected to language requesting that GEF give high priority to  identifying technology needs, noting that SBI has the  responsibility to guide the GEF in this regard.

The conclusions noted the result of consultations by the  Secretariat on (an) international technology information  centre(s), as well as enhanced national or regional centres. The  conclusions proposed that SBSTA, inter alia, urge the SBI to  request the GEF to give a high priority to activities that  enhance the capacity of national and regional technology  information centres. A number of developed countries said it was  far too early to set priorities and suggested inviting further  comments from Parties. They noted the absence of clear guidance  on the service desired. Proposals were made to acknowledge that  such centres already exist and that access should be improved.  The group will reconvene on Wednesday.

One group of countries proposed draft decisions for COP-4 on  technology transfer and capacity building, but several  delegations requested time to consider the proposals and noted  that the contact group was tasked to produce only SBSTA  conclusions.

Land Use Change and Forestry: The contact group on Land Use  Change and Forestry met in the afternoon and the evening. In the  afternoon, delegates reviewed draft SBSTA conclusions. Debate  centered on paragraphs related to the timing and content of an  IPCC workshop, report and Third Assessment Report. Delegates  made a series of proposals on the draft conclusions, which were  compiled into a revised text with brackets.

As of 8pm, delegates began consideration of a revised draft  text. Under the revised text, SBSTA would request the  Secretariat to organize a workshop prior to COP-4 with  participation by experts nominated by the IPCC. The purpose of  the workshop would be to consider [as the first priority] the  data availability and definitions used by Parties and  international organizations. It would also agree [to consider at  its session] or [to hold] a second workshop after COP-4 to focus  [more specifically] on issues arising from Article 3.4 and  comments submitted by Parties.

The revised text also contained two alternative paragraphs on  the IPCC report. Under the first alternative, SBSTA would  request the IPCC to make available a [special] report on land- use, land use changes and forestry [in a timely manner], [no  later than June 2000] or [if possible by COP-5, but no later  than six months prior to COP-6]. The paragraph specifies that  the IPCC should address the methodological, scientific and  technical implications of the relevant Articles of the Protocol.  Under the second alternative, the [special] report should  address the methodological and technical implications of  [Articles 3.3, 3.4, 3.7 and 7.1] of the Protocol. IPCC would  also set the overall scientific context for consideration of  LUCF [and agricultural soils] activities. Bracketed text would  also have the IPCC address activities under Article 3.4 and  those not covered by Article 3.3, including: improvements in  forest management, soil and forest conservation; and re- vegetation of degraded lands.

Allocation of Work for COP-5: The SBI/SBSTA contact group on  allocation of work for COP-5 met to discuss a Co-Chairs' set of  draft conclusions. A representative of a group of developing  countries objected to the proliferation of contact groups. There  was general agreement that this contact group should only meet  after other groups.

Several developed country and group representatives expressed  satisfaction with the draft paper, one noting, in particular,  the inclusion of tasks addressing the Kyoto Protocol's Article  on compliance issues. One Party noted the omission of emissions  trading. The Secretariat responded that this contact group's  agenda item topic refers to allocation of work for COP/MOP-1  only, and the Kyoto Protocol does not mandate these issues to be  addressed then; furthermore, a decision on emissions trading is  expected from the contact group on mechanisms. Another Party  suggested improving the structure of the document, currently  with 'Task,' 'Allocation,' and 'Programme of work' up to COP-5  in tabular form, by identifying inter-linkages between elements  of the work programme and organizing it according to goals,  priorities, timelines and strategies. Two Parties asked about  deadlines, to which the Chair replied it is up to the Parties.  The Chair asked for written inputs for the next meeting, on  Thursday.

Adverse Impacts: The contact group on adverse impacts met in the  afternoon to discuss a Co-Chairs' compilation of written inputs  and draft decision. The Chair announced inputs had been received  from three Parties/regional groups and noted the text is not  'final.' He also noted that some Parties have drawn a  distinction between impacts of climate change and the impacts of  response policies. One Party favored not making such a  distinction now but leaving it until the analytical stage. One  Party objected to referring only to a Convention Article rather  than the Kyoto Protocol in a paragraph on funding versus  compensation, but another participant responded that nothing in  the FCCC nor the Kyoto Protocol requires compensation. After  much discussion the group decided to meet again at 3 p.m. on  Wednesday to discuss the text.

Non-Annex I Party Communications: The contact group on non-Annex  I Party communications and the financial mechanism met briefly  to consider a proposal from Chair John Ashe (Antigua and  Barbuda) for continuing negotiations. Parties agreed to the  proposal for four representatives of the G-77/China and four  representatives from other groups to proceed with negotiations  and report to the contact group by Friday.

Second Review of the Adequacy of FCCC Articles 4.2 (A) and (B):  The contact group on a second review of the adequacy of  commitments under FCCC Articles 4.2(a) and (b) met briefly in  the morning. A number of developing country delegations asked  the Co-Chair to inform the subsidiary body Chairs and the FCCC  Executive Secretary about their concerns that delegations are  unable to attend all the contact groups. They also called for  strict adherence to the FCCC, drawing attention to the G-77/China's position paper, which states that COP-4 must not be  distracted from carrying out the review by introducing  extraneous matters such as the consideration of new commitments  for non-Annex I Parties. A developed country Party said he did  not agree with the G-77/China's interpretation of Article 4.2(d)  on reviews.

This view was shared by a grouping of developed countries whose  representative said the review must respect FCCC Article 4.2(d).  He said science had demonstrated that the commitments in 4.2(a)  and (b) were inadequate, and the G-77/China position paper  failed to stay within the mandate of Article 4.2(d). He said it  would be useful for future reviews if some work on the objective  of the Convention, and on whether Parties are on course to  fulfil the objective, could be undertaken. A developing country  added that paragraphs 5-8 (requirement for increasingly global  participation, long-term stabilization, Article 4.2(g) (FCCC  provision for voluntary commitments), and development of the  FCCC) in the EU position paper on review of adequacy were  extraneous.

The Co-Chair suggested that Parties be guided by the Berlin  Mandate. A group representative said the EU position paper was  within the ambit of the review. The Berlin Mandate was finished  and Parties were starting the second review with a clean sheet  of paper. The Co-Chair said Parties had focused on: the scope of  the review, timing, and information required and there were  'drastically opposed views.' The Co-Chair proposed that she  draft a decision after another contact group meeting. The  contact group adjourned to allow G-77/China participants to  attend a regional group meeting on cooperative mechanisms. At an  evening session, the contact group discussed the question of the  scope of the second review.

# IN THE CORRIDORS I

The COP-4 host, Argentina, is reported to have been heavily  criticized at a G-77/China group meeting when its  representatives 'broke ranks' and signaled a willingness to  unilaterally adopt a legally binding and substantial gross  emissions target. There is some bemusement among other G-77  delegations at Argentina's position because it would not  automatically qualify the country for its goal of admission to  emissions trading. The COP-4 hosts have reportedly met with the  US to discuss their initiative.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

In the ongoing internal negotiations on burden sharing among  European Union members, one member has reportedly linked its  negotiating position to negotiations at the FCCC on capping in  emissions trading. A number of European countries are reported  to be experiencing severe difficulties with their dispensations  within the European bubble arrangement in the run up to a round  of high-level negotiations later this month. Meanwhile, the  transport lobby is reported to be working towards a deal on  vehicle efficiency standards (equivalent to business as usual  assessments) to pre-empt a multi-sector allocation of indicative  emissions reduction targets across the Union.
