Contact groups convened on sinks in the CDM, UNFCCC Article 4.8  and 4.9 (adverse effects) and the Special Climate Change Fund.  Informal consultations on the programme budget for the biennium  2004-2005 and the IPCC TAR also took place.

# SBSTA

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Good practice guidance on LULUCF: Contact  group Co-Chair Audun Rosland (Norway) introduced the draft  conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.3), which the SBSTA adopted without  amendment. The conclusions take note of the IPCC's work on: good  practice guidance on LULUCF; definitions on degradation and  devegetation; and the factoring out of natural and indirect human  effects on carbon stock change. In the conclusions, SBSTA requests  the Secretariat to prepare a paper on draft common reporting  formats and decides to continue consideration of issues relating  to harvested wood products at SBSTA-19.

###     Emissions resulting from fuel used in international aviation and  maritime transportation

Contact group Co-Chair Greg Terrill  (Australia) introduced the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.2),  which the SBSTA then adopted. In these conclusions, the SBSTA  invites the International Maritime Organization, International  Civil Aviation Organization and UNFCCC Secretariats to set up two  expert meetings before SBSTA-20 to discuss options to improve the  methodologies for estimating and reporting emissions from  international aviation and maritime transportation.

###     Review of methodological work under the UNFCCC and Protocol

Harald Dovland (Norway) reported on informal consultations on the  issue. He said the annex to the draft conclusions, which contain  initial proposals by Parties on elements of a possible future work  programme, remains entirely bracketed. Parties then adopted the  draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.8), which describe the  purpose of the methodological work, note the need to prioritize  work on methodologies, and underscore the importance of reliable  information. In the conclusions, SBSTA requests Parties to submit  further views on elements of a possible future work programme.

###     Issues relating to reporting and review of Annex I greenhouse gas  inventories

Consultations on this matter were conducted by Chair  Thorgeirsson. Parties adopted the draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.7), and agreed to recommend a draft COP  decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.7/Add.1). The conclusions recommend  that COP-9 adopt the draft decision relating to the technical  review of greenhouse gas inventories, which contains a training  programme for ERT members, a code of practice for the treatment of  confidential information, and an agreement for expert review  services for members of ERTs.

###     Issues relating to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8

Contact group Co- Chair Helen Plume (New Zealand) reported on outcomes of the  group's work, noting that delegates had addressed adjustments  under Article 5.2 (adjustments) and issues relating to the  implementation of Article 8. Parties agreed to recommend draft COP  and COP/MOP decisions on technical guidance on methodologies for  adjustments (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6/Add.2), and an addendum to these  draft decisions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6/Add.3), containing technical  guidance on methodologies for adjustments. Following an amendment,  Parties agreed to recommend draft COP and COP/MOP decisions on the  implementation of Article 8 (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6/Add.1), including  the training programme for ERT members and criteria for selecting  lead reviewers. Murray Ward (New Zealand) reported on informal  consultations on registries, and Parties adopted the draft  conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6).

### DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Reporting on the  informal consultations on development and transfer of technology,  Co-Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) said that three  informal meetings had been convened on the results of the workshop  on enabling environments, held in Ghent, Belgium, from 9-10 April  2003. Delegates then adopted the draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.5). In these conclusions, SBSTA requests the  EGTT to consider the development of environmentally sound  technologies and the outcomes of the workshop on synergies, and  then recommend further actions to SBSTA. It also requests the  Secretariat, subject to the availability of resources, to organize  senior-level round-table discussions between governments, business  and industry at COP-9, and a special meeting of the EGTT in  conjunction with the technology events planned by the Government  of India in November 2003.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Contact group Co-Chair Sok  Apadu (Mauritius) provided a brief overview of the draft  conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.4), and the draft decision  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.4/Add.1). Parties then adopted the draft  conclusions and agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP.  In the conclusions, SBSTA notes recommendations on observing  standards and data exchange, integrated global climate-quality  products, capacity building and systems improvements, and  reporting by Parties. The SBSTA also requests Parties to submit  views on priorities for actions. In the draft decision, the COP  urges Parties to support high priority needs by contributing to  relevant funding mechanisms, and requests the Global Climate  Observing System Secretariat to coordinate the development of a  phased five to ten year implementation plan for integrated global  climate observing systems.

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The SBSTA  adopted the draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.9), with a minor  amendment. The conclusions provide that SBSTA: agrees to continue  discussing cooperation with other conventions at SBSTA-19;  welcomes the IPCC decision to undertake its Fourth Assessment  Report; and encourages Parties to coordinate issues relevant to  the UNFCCC and the WTO at the national level.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### SINKS IN THE CDM

In this contact group, Parties considered the  Co-Chairs' draft conclusions and commented on the draft  negotiating text on modalities and procedures for afforestation  and reforestation (A&R) project activities under the CDM. Parties  agreed to the draft conclusions. The G-77/CHINA, with BRAZIL and  CANADA, noted that some issues need to be further addressed in the  draft negotiating text. He also raised the need to define non- permanence and further consider uncertainty. SENEGAL, supported by  CHILE, said that modalities for small-scale CDM projects should be  developed.

### IPCC TAR

The IPCC TAR contact group completed its work after two  days of informal consultations. Delegates reached agreement on  outstanding issues, including whether and how to address cross- cutting issues of adaptation and mitigation.

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND

Following informal consultations in  the afternoon, the contact group reconvened in the evening and  agreed to the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, after a minor  editorial amendment proposed by Argentina.

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

After informal consultations on this  item in the morning, this contact group convened in the afternoon  to consider a revised Co-Chairs' proposal for the draft  conclusions. These conclusions include partially agreed paragraphs.  The EU, CANADA, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN, US, AOSIS and NEW ZEALAND noted  that while the text did not serve all their interests, they  supported its use as the basis for negotiation. They said that if  there was no agreement on the use of this text, they would prefer  stating this in the draft conclusions and not forwarding any text  to SBI-19. SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA for the AFRICA GROUP, KUWAIT,  VENEZUELA, and NIGERIA opposed the use of the text, and proposed  using the last version of the draft conclusions or conclude that  there was no agreement. SAUDI ARABIA cautioned against setting a  precedent by not forwarding any draft texts to the next session.  Recalling previous instances where Parties have 'agreed to  disagree,' the US objected, and said that Parties were not obliged  to forward the penultimate text.

Co-Chair Fadhel Lari noted that Parties were unable to agree, and  proposed that the draft conclusions state that the SBI did not  complete its work on the agenda item and agreed to continue at the  next session. SBI Chair Daniela Stoycheva then welcomed Parties to  a pre-sessional meeting to consider how to continue with this  agenda item.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

After the sinks in the CDM contact group concluded Thursday,  several observers noted that agreement on this issue was now 'long  overdue,' and suggested that the text in the annex on modalities  and procedures will provide a sound basis for discussions at  SBSTA-19. Others were less optimistic and wondered if a decision  would be postponed until COP-10, noting that the 27-page text  remains heavily bracketed. In other news, some observers expressed  hope that Russia's ratification would be submitted to the Duma for  consideration next week, creating a much-needed boost to the  subdued ambiance of SB-18.
