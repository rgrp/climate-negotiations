# JOINT SBI/SBSTA SESSION

On compliance under the Protocol, the G-77/CHINA said Annex I  Parties' communications should include information on Convention  implementation, particularly: policies and measures to modify  longer term trends; new and additional finance; assistance to  meet adaptation costs; technology transfer; and capacity  building of developing countries. AOSIS expressing  disappointment at the overall increase in Annex I Parties'  emissions, proposed that COP-5 review implementation of Annex I  Party commitments. The EU said this meeting could make progress  on, inter alia: implementation of Annex I Party FCCC  commitments; development and transfer of technology; further  elaboration of the Protocol mechanisms, giving priority to the  clean development mechanism (CDM); and development of a strong  and efficient compliance system. The AFRICAN GROUP, emphasized  Africa's special needs relating to adaptation to adverse  effects, capacity building and technology transfer. He advocated  an early start to the CDM. Chair Kante said that a Joint Working  Group, chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and Espen RÃ¸nnenberg  (Marshall Islands), would continue consideration of the issue.

On AIJ under the pilot phase, the G-77/CHINA and others  expressed concern at the lack of regional balance in projects.  The AFRICAN GROUP and NORWAY called for capacity building to  remedy this, particularly in Africa. AOSIS said AIJ project  experience internationally was inadequate for a meaningful  review. SWITZERLAND called for development of terms of reference  for the review of the pilot phase for consideration by COP-5.  The US, with JAPAN and GUATEMALA, said experiences gained from  AIJ projects could provide valuable lessons for Protocol  mechanism development. She noted the need for a smooth  transition from the pilot phase to project-based mechanisms.  COSTA RICA underscored the role of AIJ projects in its  sustainable development agenda, and called on COP-5 to take a  definitive decision on AIJ's status. GUATEMALA, with BRAZIL,  supported AIJ project eligibility for CDM certification, if the  project meets the necessary criteria and, with RUSSIA, called  for straightforward guidelines for the certification system. As  AIJ does not include a credit element and lacks adequate  reference to sustainable development, IRAN opposed linking it  with CDM.

On the Protocol mechanisms, the G-77/CHINA stressed the need to,  inter alia: begin with formulating principles to guide the  methodological and operational process; establish a common  understanding of the mechanisms; and ensure that the nature and  scope of mechanisms do not perpetuate North-South inequities.  Stating that mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic  action, the EU noted the need to ensure that they do not  undermine commitments under the Protocol. She advocated for a  properly defined ceiling that will encourage Annex B countries  to define strong policies and measures.

The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) reported on a recent  CDM workshop held in Dakar, Senegal. The workshop conclusions  highlighted, inter alia, that: CDM should act as a catalyst for  sustainable development; studies on Protocol mechanisms should  be extended to all African countries; a wide spectrum of  projects and private sector involvement should be promoted; and  capacity building of negotiators, companies, potential  certifiers and others involved in CDM should be encouraged.

On the Protocol mechanisms, CHINA said the synthesis of  proposals on emissions trading contained several extraneous  elements, such as competitiveness and market size, and called  for a revised synthesis. The US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, RUSSIAN  FEDERATION, NORWAY, NEW ZEALAND and CANADA opposed the EU  proposal to place caps on the use of the Protocol mechanisms.  They said, inter alia, that the proposal would: re-open the  'package' agreed in Kyoto; reduce the flow of new resources to  developing countries; impede the cost effectiveness of the  mechanisms; hinder wider acceptance of the Protocol by domestic  constituencies; and create a double standard by not clarifying  how it applies to Article 4 (EU 'bubble'). SWITZERLAND proposed  a post-verification system for emissions trading that allows  Parties to trade only the excess of assigned amount units.  Certificates for these excess units, to be issued by the  Secretariat, would automatically be valid. Supported by  KAZAKHSTAN, he proposed that JI begin prior to 2008.

The AFRICAN GROUP, supported setting caps on the use of  mechanisms to meet Protocol commitments and said the CDM should  avoid replicating the inequitable regional distribution of  projects experienced during the AIJ pilot phase. AOSIS said that  actions under the mechanisms should be supplemental to domestic  action and, with SENEGAL, indicated that the mechanisms be  guided by equity and transparency principles.

On capacity building, SWITZERLAND called for an overview of past  and ongoing initiatives on AIJ and the mechanisms. The EU  suggested focussing on awareness raising and information  regarding the design of options for the mechanisms. With regard  to proposed action, she suggested a clearer division of labor  between the relevant bodies and institutions. Chair Chow  suggested he chair a joint contact group on mechanisms and  established an informal group on AIJ, co-chaired by the EC and  Zimbabwe.

On research and systematic observation, SWITZERLAND and the  AFRICAN GROUP urged implementation of COP-4's recommendations.  The US expressed concern at the declining state of the global  observational network. CANADA, with the EU and RUSSIA, urged  support for the Global Climate Observatory System (GCOS). The  MARSHALL ISLANDS called for development of national plans to  address observational gaps and data deficiencies and support  strengthening of endogenous capacities. Chair Chow said informal  consultations aimed at producing specific recommendations will  continue.

Regarding guidelines for national communications, the IPCC noted  its recent work to improve guidelines for national inventory  preparation. AUSTRALIA called for separate development of  guidelines for national communications inventory data. NORWAY  said more experience on the use of guidelines was necessary  before a final decision is taken. The EU and JAPAN supported a  common reporting format proposed for inventory data guidelines.  The US cautioned against overly prescriptive guidelines. CANADA  stressed substance, not timing, as the most important  consideration and, with POLAND, said it is impractical for and  beyond the means of Parties to report on all climate change  related policies and measures. RUSSIA opposed Canada's  suggestion for an annual system of providing inventories, as it  would be costly and difficult. A contact group chaired by Mark  Mwandosya (Tanzania) and Jim Penman (UK) will consider this  issue further.

Regarding the review process related to greenhouse gas  inventories, the EU said domestic review processes conducted in  an open and transparent manner would alleviate further review  processes. POLAND noted that if Parties decide to change  inventory methodology, artificial reduction of emissions may  occur, and proposed recalculating emissions whenever the COP  adopts new or amended emission inventory methodology.

Concerning the work programme on methodological issues, the EU  said early completion of the work programme should be followed  by a testing period to guarantee the step-by-step improvements  and refinement of guidelines and modalities. CANADA underscored  the importance of developing realistic review guidelines and,  with the US, called for a more streamlined approach. AUSTRALIA  emphasized defining realistic objectives for COP-6 and  maintaining a clear sense of the different requirements of the  Convention and the Protocol.

On land use, land-use change and forestry, delegates were  briefed on a recent workshop held in Indianapolis on other land  use activities. IPCC outlined a Special Report being prepared  for consideration at SBSTA-11. Key issues to be addressed  include, inter alia: the implications of different definitions,  including forests, afforestation, deforestation and  reforestation; the question of which carbon pools should be  considered when evaluating implications for relevant net carbon  emissions; the accuracy of measurements for each type of carbon  pool; and the factors to be used in setting baselines. ICELAND  called for care when implementing the Protocol to minimize  disruption to existing climate change policies. MARSHALL ISLANDS  said no new sink categories should be adopted until accounting  difficulties have been resolved.

# SBI

SBI continued discussion of non-Annex I communications. On  financial and technical support for non-Annex I communications,  AOSIS cautioned against standardizing content requirements for  national communications and indicated the benefits of allowing  small states to complete national communications on a regional  basis. The EU, noting that the GEF had increased funding for  non-Annex I communications, said the financial mechanism had  responded effectively to developing country needs. The G-77/CHINA called for clear guidance on financial and technical  support and said the GEF did not provide adequate funding.  BOTSWANA, ZIMBABWE and the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC said  national communications should be an ongoing process and noted  that practical difficulties faced by non-Annex I Parties impede  the necessary continuity.

On interaction between FCCC and the GEF, the REPUBLIC OF KOREA  observed that the GEF Council Members also represented Parties  to the Convention. URUGUAY expressed satisfaction with the GEF's  assistance. MEXICO highlighted the need to share experiences at  the regional level to build capacities for national  communications. The US emphasized continuity in information  sharing and proposed conducting an annual update of inventories  contained in initial communications. Chair Kante suggested  continued discussion in a contact group and a meeting between  the G-77/CHINA, the GEF and implementing agencies to exchange  views on the difficulties encountered in providing financial  resources for non-Annex I communications.

On arrangements for intergovernmental meetings, Parties  exchanged views on COP-5: when it should commence; whether a  Committee of the Whole (COW) should be created; what form the  High Level Segment should take; and dates for COP-6. Several  Parties, including EGYPT, the EU, JAPAN, POLAND and RUSSIA  favored establishing a COW as it would benefit small  delegations. Stating that COP-5 will be largely a technical  meeting, SAUDI ARABIA, with KAZAKHSTAN and CHINA, opposed the  creation of a COW. CANADA and SLOVENIA preferred the High Level  Segment but without formal oral presentations. The EU suggested  an informal panel discussion between ministers to enable them to  focus on important political issues.

EGYPT proposed grouping controversial issues into clusters and  discussing them in workshops before COP-5. SAUDI ARABIA and  CHINA cautioned against introducing controversial issues that  could 'torpedo' the success of COP-5. The NETHERLANDS expressed  interest in hosting COP-6. Chair Kante requested the Rapporteur  to consult with Parties and find common ground on these issues.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The halls of the Maritim witnessed a second day of relative  calm. When asked for their two-week forecast, few were openly  optimistic or pessimistic regarding the meeting's outcome, but  many were concerned about the manner and timing for addressing  the complicated agenda. Some observers contrasted the  proliferation of information and proposals for the operation of  the mechanisms to the dearth of trust shared by the key interest  groups, who seem reluctant to make the leap of faith needed to  move into substantive discussion.
