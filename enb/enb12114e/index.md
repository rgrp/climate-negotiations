# JOINT SBI/SBSTA SESSION

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Former SBSTA Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia)  reported on a workshop on implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and  4.9 (adverse effects) held from 21 - 24 September 1999 in Bonn.  Many delegates said the workshop was a useful exercise. The G-77/CHINA said it had highlighted the need for another workshop  prior to COP-6.

Regarding information gaps on adverse effects, the MARSHALL  ISLANDS called for more robust research on policies and measures  in Annex I countries. AUSTRALIA, with CANADA and the GAMBIA, said  the absence of information on the effect of policies and measures  should not be an obstacle to meeting the needs of the truly  vulnerable. CANADA and SAMOA highlighted the need to act through  the national communications process. SENEGAL called for an  evaluation of vulnerability in Africa by COP-6.

On the impact of response measures on the economies of oil  producing and other countries, SAUDI ARABIA referred to recent  studies suggesting oil producing countries will suffer  economically from response measures and, with KUWAIT and LIBYA,  said developed countries should remove market distortions in the  energy sector. The US said there was uncertainty over the impact  of implementation of response measures. JAPAN and the MARSHALL  ISLANDS said consideration of compensation was unacceptable as it  is not provided for in the FCCC or the Protocol.

On the status of negotiations, several delegates, including SAUDI  ARABIA, KUWAIT, QATAR and the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, said equal  progress must be made on all issues, and the Buenos Aires Plan of  Action (BAPA) should be achieved as a complete package. UGANDA,  BURKINA FASO, the MARSHALL ISLANDS and SAMOA said not all issues  could be advanced simultaneously and stated that waiting for a  package would delay action.

Numerous delegates stressed prioritization of the needs of least  developed countries. BANGLADESH suggested that the GEF establish a  separate fund to meet these countries' needs. A contact group will  be convened on this issue.

### COMPLIANCE

On procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance  under the Kyoto Protocol, Espen RÃ¸nnenberg, Co-Chair of the Joint  Working Group on compliance (JWG), made a brief report of the  informal exchange of views on compliance held in Vienna between 6  - 7 October 1999. Issues discussed included: design of and factors  triggering the compliance system; role of the expert review team  and COP/MOP; and the consequences of non-compliance.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

On capacity building, many delegates welcomed  the G77/CHINA draft decision on capacity building for developing  countries, containing a list of developing country needs, as a  basis for adopting a decision at COP-5.

On recipients of capacity building, the G77/CHINA said these are  developing countries only, while the EU, KAZAKHSTAN and others  said it included countries with economies in transition.

The MARSHALL ISLANDS with the SUDAN, the GAMBIA, AOSIS and CHINA  said the process had to be country driven rather than agency  driven and must follow the guidance of the COP. The PHILIPPINES  recommended that capacity building be 'for,' 'by' and 'in'  developing countries and said the GEF initiative was the  antithesis of capacity building. CANADA, supporting the GEF  initiative, urged the GEF to further develop its interagency  approach.

The G77/CHINA referred to its draft decision that, inter alia,  requests the Secretariat to prepare a plan to facilitate capacity  building for developing countries. He underscored the importance  of workshops being undertaken with the participation of developing  countries. The CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC highlighted the futility  of short workshops, as developing countries needed continuous  ones. The EU suggested: identifying non-Annex I Parties' needs by  analyzing their national communications; identifying existing  capacities; agreeing on a process to ensure that priority areas  receive appropriate support; and providing guidance for  establishing an assessment of capacity-building activities on  climate change. CANADA supported a coordinated response among  existing efforts in capacity building and proposed three steps:  assessment of needs; overview of actions currently undertaken by  various actors; and definition of a clear scope for action.  AUSTRALIA sought information from the Secretariat on current  support for developing countries in order to identify gaps and  needs for future work. NORWAY favored an integrated approach for  the identification of needs. SWITZERLAND endorsed a practical  approach focused on identifying appropriate needs in specific  areas. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION offered technology transfer  assistance.

On capacity building needs, the G77/CHINA referred to its draft  decision calling on the COP to, inter alia: conduct capacity  building activities; provide the necessary financial and technical  support to strengthen national focal points; promote climate- related research and studies; and promote capacity building of  national institutions and expertise. AUSTRALIA, CANADA, JAPAN and  UZBEKISTAN said that capacity building was necessary to take full  advantage of the clean development mechanism (CDM). The US  highlighted the need for an integrated approach to all capacity- building efforts. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK supported a bottom-up  approach to capacity building based on local and regional  initiatives involving the NGO community, as many criteria for the  mechanisms are still unknown, it. A contact group will be  convened, co-chaired by SBI Chair John Ashe and Dan Reifsnyder  (US).

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY

On the experience with AIJ, the G-77/CHINA underlined the imbalance of the geographical distribution  of pilot projects and urged extension of the pilot phase. AOSIS  said carbon sequestration projects may not guarantee measurable  and long-term effects and expressed concern over the possible  inclusion of sinks. With the MARSHALL ISLANDS, BOTSWANA and SAMOA,  he opposed linking AIJ to the Protocol mechanisms. JAPAN,  supported by the EU, said the experience gained is sufficient for  a comprehensive review. With POLAND, he stressed that an AIJ  project should be eligible under joint implementation (JI) or CDM  if it meets the criteria for eligibility and if the Parties  involved agree. The MARSHALL ISLANDS urged discontinuation of  temporary carbon storage projects under AIJ. The US proposed  exploring the eligibility of AIJ projects under CDM or JI.

Opposed by AOSIS, BOTSWANA and IRAN, the EU, with SWITZERLAND,  proposed that AIJ should be credited retroactively. She identified  the lack of crediting and capacity in the host countries and high  transaction costs for small projects as barriers in the pilot  phase. SWITZERLAND and AUSTRALIA said that without credit,  industries would be cautious about AIJ.

IRAN noted the absence of criteria for assessing and elaborating  the benefits of AIJ projects and said these were subject to  different interpretations by the Parties. He called for a  continuation of the pilot phase without preconditions or credits.  BOTSWANA said introducing crediting would confuse the process.  AOSIS  drew attention to the inaccuracies, under-reporting and  procedural complications that make it inappropriate to credit  retrospectively.

The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said that since most AIJ projects are  financed though official funds like ODA and the GEF, credits  certification should be treated carefully. The AFRICAN GROUP  underscored the need to involve local communities in the design  and execution of such projects.

On the reporting format, SWITZERLAND stressed simplicity. The US  suggested that the Secretariat convene a technical meeting on the  common reporting format. A contact group will be convened chaired  by Yvo de Boer (Netherlands).

### PROTOCOL MECHANISMS

Former SBSTA Chair Chow introduced the  revised synthesis of proposals by Parties on principles,  modalities, rules and guidelines on Protocol mechanisms and noted  that they could form the basis for a draft negotiating text.

The G-77/CHINA said a CDM decision must precede decisions on other  mechanisms. AUSTRALIA noted the need for considerable technical  work prior to COP-6. The EU noted significant areas of convergence  among Parties but said a ceiling on the use of mechanisms has to  be defined. The US supported parallel progress on the mechanisms  with priority given to the CDM. With NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, he  suggested refining the synthesis into a draft negotiating text.  NORWAY further identified the need to decide on a work plan in the  run-up to COP-6. AOSIS highlighted the need for the mechanisms to  be based on sound environmental principles and, with VENEZUELA,  called for adequate time for consideration. He added that AOSIS  would not permit mechanisms that allow Annex I Parties to offload  domestic responsibilities. UZBEKISTAN, with the RUSSIAN  FEDERATION, sought clear definitions of core concepts. CHINA  opposed taking a single decision on all mechanisms as this was not  supported by the Protocol. He recommended that there be three  distinct decisions on the mechanisms. SAUDI ARABIA stressed that  progress on this issue is conditional on progress on other equally  important issues. A contact group, to be chaired by Kok Kee Chow,  was asked to revise and consolidate the views into a draft  negotiating text and agree on a work plan in the run-up to COP-6.  The G-77/CHINA said that the reference to the draft negotiating  text was unwarranted at this stage.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

The JWG met in a night session to adopt its organization of work  and hear an oral report of the informal exchange of views and  information on compliance at an event held on October 6 - 7 1999  in Vienna. It then considered elements of the design, coverage and  functions of a compliance system under the Protocol. The JWG will  reconvene on 29 October at 10:00 am.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### GUIDELINES FOR ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

The contact group on Annex  I communications considered the second part of a revised draft  text on Guidelines for Annex I communications. The group discussed  sections in the text on: objectives of the guidelines, preparing  national communications, definitions, coverage and structure of  national communications; the executive summary; national  circumstances; GHG inventory information; and policies and  measures (P&Ms). Delegates agreed to delete the section on  coverage. The EU submitted a proposal to re-structure the section  on national communications. On selection of P&Ms, the group agreed  on the differentiation of policies 'adopted,' 'implemented' and at  a 'planning stage,' for reporting purposes and called for  definitions of these terms.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

The contact group on non-Annex I  communications discussed proposals submitted by the G-77/China and  the EU on consideration of non-Annex I communications. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU and others, insisted that its proposal  serve as the basis for the group's discussions. Some delegates  proposed identification of common elements between the two  proposals. The G-77/CHINA, supported by others, drew attention to  contentious elements, including technical assessments of non-Annex  I communications contained in the EU proposal. She questioned the  purpose, nature and usefulness of these assessments. The EU and  others said the purpose of technical assessments is to improve  non-Annex I communications. The group agreed to work on a draft  text compiling the two proposals.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While it was business-as-usual in the Plenary on Tuesday, land  use, land-use change and forestry was the subject of a stimulating  side event convened at the behest of the Parties. At the event,  the IPCC took the innovative step of providing an in-depth  progress report on its work on LULUCF that was requested by SBSTA.  Participants, including NGOs, welcomed the long awaited exchange  with IPCC expert authors that shed light on an issue previously  shrouded in uncertainty.
