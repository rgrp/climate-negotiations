# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE IPCC

The IPCC was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological  Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme  (UNEP). The purpose of the IPCC is to assess the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding  the risks associated with human-induced climate change. The IPCC  does not undertake new research, nor does it monitor climate- related data, but bases its assessments on published and peer- reviewed scientific and technical literature. Its Secretariat is  located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is staffed by the WMO and UNEP.

Since its inception, the IPCC has prepared a series of  comprehensive assessments, special reports and technical papers,  which provide scientific information on climate change to the  international community, including policy makers and the public.  This information has played an important role in the negotiations  under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC).

The IPCC currently has three working groups: Working Group I  addresses the scientific aspects of the climate system and climate  change; Working Group II addresses the vulnerability of  socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, negative and  positive consequences of climate change and adaptation options;  and Working Group III addresses options for limiting greenhouse  gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change.

The IPCC also has a Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas  Inventories. This Task Force oversees the IPCC National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories Programme (NGGIP), which aims to develop and  refine an internationally-agreed methodology and software for the  calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and  removals, and to encourage the use of this methodology by  countries participating in the IPCC and by UNFCCC signatories. The  IPCC Bureau, composed of 30 members elected by the Panel, assists  the IPCC Chair in planning, coordinating and monitoring progress  in the work of the IPCC.

### KEY IPCC PRODUCTS

The IPCC completed its initial comprehensive  assessments of climate change in the First Assessment Report in  1990 and the Second Assessment Report in 1995. The IPCC's Third  Assessment Report (TAR) was completed in 2001. It addresses  policy-relevant scientific, technical, and socioeconomic  dimensions of climate change, and concentrates on findings since  1995 at both regional and global levels. The TAR, which was  subject to extensive review from experts and governments, is  composed of a comprehensive assessment from the three IPCC Working  Groups, a Summary for Policy Makers (SPM), a Technical Summary of  each Working Group report, and a Synthesis Report. The TAR  Synthesis Report is written in a non-technical style aimed at  policy makers and discusses nine policy-relevant questions  identified by the IPCC based on submissions by governments. The  IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) is due to be released in  2007.

The IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, which  are used for calculating and reporting national greenhouse gas  emissions and removals, were first released in 1994, and a revised  set was released in 1996. In 2000 and 2003, the Panel approved  additional good practice guidance reports that complement the  Revised 1996 Guidelines and, in 2003, approved a process for a  further revision of the Guidelines by early 2006.

### NINETEENTH SESSION

At IPCC-19, held from 17-20 April 2002, in  Geneva, Switzerland, the IPCC began work on the AR4. The Panel  took a number of decisions, including those in relation to a draft  workplan for developing definitions for forest degradation and  devegetation, methodological options for recording and reporting  on emissions from these activities, and aspects of the procedures  for agreeing on NGGIP products. Delegates also decided: on the  timing of the AR4; to hold a workshop on geological and oceanic  carbon dioxide separation, capture and storage; to draft a scoping  paper on climate change and water; and to hold an expert meeting  on climate change and development.

### TWENTIETH SESSION

IPCC-20 was held from 19-21 February 2003, in  Paris, France. Delegates agreed on a workplan for two expert  'scoping meetings' on how to structure the AR4. They discussed a  framework and a set of criteria for establishing priorities for  special reports, methodology reports and technical papers for the  period of the fourth assessment. The Panel also decided to hold a  high-level scientific meeting to survey the processes affecting  terrestrial carbon stocks and human influences upon them, and to  produce two special reports: one on safeguarding the ozone layer  and the global climate system; and the other on carbon dioxide  capture and storage.

### TWENTY-FIRST SESSION

At IPCC-21, held from 3-7 November 2003, in  Vienna, Austria, delegates reviewed the outlines of the proposed  Working Group contributions to the AR4 and the Chair's proposal  for an AR4 Synthesis Report. The Panel agreed that a technical  paper on climate change and water should be completed in 2007,  discussed terms of reference for a document on the AR4 product  set, and reviewed the report of the IPCC expert meeting on  processes affecting terrestrial carbon stocks and human influences  on them. Delegates also approved the terms of reference for  reviewing the Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories, and agreed on a revised mandate and changed the  name of the Task Group on Scenarios for Climate and Impacts  Assessment to the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for  Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA).

### TWENTY-SECOND SESSION

IPCC-22 convened from 9-11 November 2004,  in New Delhi, India. Delegates discussed the scope, content and  process for an AR4 Synthesis Report, AR4 products, outreach, the  IPCC programme and budget for 2005-08, and election procedures.  The Panel adopted a decision on the IPCC programme and budget for  2005-08 and agreed to work towards a 30-page AR4 Synthesis Report  with a five-page SPM to be approved by the IPCC in late October  2007.

### TWENTY-THIRD SESSION

At IPCC-23, which convened on 8 April 2005,  in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, delegates considered the joint  activities of Working Groups I and II on the Special Report on  Safeguarding the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System. The  Panel accepted this Special Report along with an SPM. In adopting  the draft report of IPCC-22, delegates also agreed that the IPCC  Bureau would further consider arrangements for management of the  AR4 Synthesis Report and report back on its progress.

### TWENTY-FOURTH SESSION

IPCC-24 was held from 26-28 September 2005,  in Montreal, Canada. Delegates approved the Special Report on  Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage and the SPM. Delegates  discussed further work on aerosols and on emissions scenarios,  outreach activities, and admittance of observer organizations, but  did not reach agreement on revised election procedures for the  IPCC Bureau and any Task Force Bureau. Delegates also decided to  establish a Task Group on New Emissions Scenarios (TGNES), with a  lifetime up to IPCC-25, to further define the emissions scenarios  development process.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### ELEVENTH CONFERENCE OF THE PARTIES TO THE UNFCCC AND FIRST MEETING  OF THE PARTIES TO THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

The eleventh Conference of  the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP 11) and the first Conference of the  Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (COP/MOP 1) took place in Montreal, Canada, from 28  November to 10 December 2005. Parties also met for the twenty-third   sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB 23).

At COP/MOP 1, parties adopted decisions on the operational details  of the Kyoto Protocol, including the package of decisions known as  the 'Marrakesh Accords,' and on a process for considering post-2012   commitments. Parties also adopted the IPCC's Good Practice Guidance   on Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) for reporting   during the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol  (2008-2012). COP 11 addressed issues such as capacity building,  technology development and transfer, the adverse effects of  climate change on developing and least developed countries, and a  process for considering future action beyond 2012 under the  UNFCCC. In its decision on long-term cooperative action to address  climate change by enhancing implementation of the UNFCCC, the COP  resolved to engage in a non-binding dialogue that would be  informed by the IPCC. Parties also agreed to a five-year work  programme for the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological  Advice (SBSTA) on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation to climate  change, and requested that SBSTA, at its twenty-eighth session,  consider additional activities based on new information, including  that presented in the AR4.

SBSTA 23 considered the IPCC's Special Report on Carbon Dioxide  Capture and Storage and, inter alia, requested the UNFCCC  Secretariat to organize an in-session workshop at SB 24 on carbon  dioxide capture and storage, and encouraged parties and the  private sector to support research and deployment of such  technologies. In relation to harvested wood products, SBSTA noted  with appreciation the IPCC report on progress made in estimating  and reporting harvested wood products in the context of preparing  its 2006 Guidelines, and decided to continue consideration of this  issue at SBSTA 24.

### ELEVENTH SESSION OF THE TGICA

At the eleventh meeting of the  TGICA, held in Cape Town, South Africa, from 7-9 February 2006,  participants discussed matters that included management of the  Data Distribution Center and the status of a TGICA initiative to  build capacity and develop appropriate data products for use in  developing countries and countries with economies in transition.  They also prepared a comment on the draft recommendations of the  TGNES, to be considered at IPCC-25.

### IPCC EXPERT MEETING ON NEW EMISSIONS SCENARIOS

At this meeting,  held from 20-22 March 2006, in Seville, Spain, participants  discussed proposals of the TGNES for developing emissions  scenarios, including: possible IPCC coordination and facilitation  with the scientific community; the process, timeline and  deliverables of new emissions scenarios development; the  organizational arrangements for the IPCC's own activities on  scenarios; and the possibility of encouraging a wider family of  non-climate scenarios that might include emissions scenarios.
