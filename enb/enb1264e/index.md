# NGO BRIEFING

At the morning briefing convened by the AGBM Chair Raúl  Estrada-Oyuela, industry and environmental NGOs were  invited to prepare comments on a number of contentious  issues.

The Chair of the non-group on policies and measures, Bakary  Kante (Senegal), reported that consensus had been reached  on cooperation among Parties, with some conditions. There  has been a clear statement of views on the issue of  coordinated and mandatory policies and measures but it will  be difficult, for the time being, to reach consensus. A  number of 'very nice' formulations have been placed in  brackets. No consensus emerged on the issue of  compensation, so this will also go forward to the AGBM  Chair unresolved.

Chair Estrada invited industry NGOs to consider the  question of whether the Parties should try to agree  mandatory policies and measures, with all countries acting  on the same general policies coordinated at  intergovernmental level, and convey their views to the AGBM  plenary Thursday morning. An industry spokesman concurred  and indicated that business favors implementation at  country-level to take account of national economic and  energy profiles.

The Chair of the non-group on FCCC Article 4.1 reported  that a text has been adopted after a constructive round of  meetings that cleared a reasonable amount of text. Two  'hard core' issues will demand the attention of the AGBM  Chair. These are: general commitments applicable to all  Parties to achieve mitigation and adaptation measures; and  transfer of environmentally sound technology. Chair Estrada  invited developing country NGOs to present short comments  on these issues. The non-group Chair welcomed Parties'  readiness to resolve the issue of means of implementation  (Article 12) although some technical items remain in  brackets.

The Chair of the non-group on institutions and mechanisms,  Takao Shibata (Japan), was invited to comment on the legal  status of the proposed Attachment 1 to register Parties'  commitments. He reported a divergence of views, with many  delegations concerned about the amendment procedure that  would apply to the Attachment. He indicated that the  outcome of discussions will be linked to the nature of the  commitments.

Bo Kjellén (Sweden) reported on the QELROs-2 non-group.  There has been near total agreement on reporting and review  (Article 8). On voluntary commitments (Article 10), he  reported that the G-77 has taken a negative line and Norway  is chairing a working group. On review of adequacy of  commitments (Article 11), Chair Kjellén said he will be  conducting consultations on a bilateral basis and  circulating his own draft text. A contact group involving  the EU, the US, and others is considering emissions  trading, and consultations are also planned on joint  implementation. Chair Estrada announced that the AGBM  Plenary will convene Thursday to begin the process of  finishing the AGBM's work, followed by closed meetings.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

In the final SBI session, delegates adopted draft  conclusions, draft decisions for adoption at COP-3 and the  report of the session. Under the draft conclusions on Annex  I communications (FCCC/SBI/1997/L.7), SBI: requested the  Secretariat to evaluate the feasibility of compiling  available supplementary data from authoritative sources on  GHG emissions for the purpose of comparison with national  submissions, reporting to SBI-9; expressed its intent to  perform an interim assessment of the in-depth reviews of  second national communications for SBI-9; and noted with  regret that insufficient responses from Annex I Parties did  not allow presentation of the schedule of in-depth reviews  at SBI-7.

Under the draft decision, COP-3 would call upon Annex I  Parties to follow the revised FCCC guidelines and request  the Secretariat to prepare a full compilation of second  national communications and publish national GHG  inventories. COP-3 would decide that in-depth reviews of  second national communications will include visits by  review teams and executive summaries of the communications  will be published as official FCCC documents.

On non-Annex I communications, delegates adopted draft  conclusions and a draft decision produced by a contact  group chaired by the US and Malaysia (FCCC/SBI/1997/L.8).  The draft SBI conclusions request the Secretariat to  organize a workshop on a process for considering initial  national communications from non-Annex I Parties. The  Secretariat is requested to submit its observations on the  national communications submitted by non-Annex I Parties by  30 March 1998. SBI also requested the Secretariat to  provide a compilation of comments by Parties at SBI-8.

The draft decision was compiled from three proposals. It  contains bracketed language stating that the process of  consideration shall assist the Secretariat's determination  of the needs of non-Annex I Parties [for the preparation of  national communications] or [related to implementation of  commitments, in particular those associated with proposed  projects and response measures]. On the type of review, the  text states that the communications should be subject to an  [in depth][technical][assessment] or [review]. Regarding  the Secretariat's future work, the decision contains  bracketed text on compilation and synthesis [annually], as  well as on proposed workshops and the selection of expert  review teams. All references to work that the COP would  request SBI and SBSTA to perform on national communications  are bracketed.

On the financial mechanism, delegates adopted two draft  decisions for COP-3 (FCCC/SBI/1997/L.9) produced by a  contact group chaired by Antigua and Barbuda. Under the  first decision, the COP would decide to continue the review  process through SBI, in accordance with the criteria  established in the guidelines adopted by SBI-5. Under the  second decision, the COP would note that the GEF Council  approved the annex to the Memorandum of Understanding  between the COP and the GEF Council and decide to approve  the annex, thereby bringing it into force.

Delegates also adopted draft COP decisions on activities  implemented jointly (AIJ) and the development and transfer  of technology. The decisions, produced by a joint SBSTA/SBI  contact group, were adopted by SBSTA on 28 October.  Delegates also adopted draft COP decisions on the financial  performance of the Convention in the biennium 1996-1997  (FCCC/SBI/1997/L.11) and on COP-4 (FCCC/SBI/1997/L.10),  which would be held Bonn in November 1998.

SBI Rapporteur Patricia Iturregui (Peru) presented the  draft report of the meeting (FCCC/SBI/1997/L.6 and CRP.9).  On proposed amendments to the Convention, the SBI decided  to recommend to the COP that any proposals be taken up in  the order they were submitted, if appropriate. SAUDI ARABIA  proposed deleting 'if appropriate,' but the EU supported  its retention. KUWAIT proposed that all amendments be taken  as 'a package.' Delegates agreed to remove the phrase in  question. The report was adopted as amended.

In closing the session, Chair Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth  (Mauritania) noted that some observers think SBI has no  problems and simply 'rubber stamps' decisions. He said this  characterization is unfair, given the amount of time and  effort spent in consultations. He said his successor should  keep SBI free of debate, and continue serve as the FCCC's  operational arm.

NON-GROUP ON QELROs The non-group discussed a new paper by Chair Luiz Gylvan  Meira Filho (Brazil) containing proposals for articles on  QELROs, national systems for the estimation of  anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of  GHGs, methodologies, global warming potentials (GWPs), an  annex listing gases and an attachment under which emission  commitments and base year/periods would appear.

On QELROs, the paper includes two alternatives on how  Parties/Party's GHG emissions shall 'not exceed' their/its  commitments, expressed either in 'terms of budgets' or  'emission budgets.' The previous negotiating text by the  AGBM Chair spoke of commitments in terms of reducing  emissions. The Chair noted the first alternative was  broader and would encompass removal of GHGs by sinks. A  regional group indicated its preference for the first  alternative. A group of countries requested that a proposal  it had made be included as a third alternative. Three  countries stated their preference for the second  alternative. Discussion continued on the net or aggregate  approach and whether commitments would be met jointly or  individually.

Considering that no progress was being made regarding  specific targets and dates, the Chair proposed either  listing them in a table or attempting to draft a paragraph  of a general nature, with gaps on specific QELROs to be  filled in at a later stage. A contact group was created to  deal with this task.

There was no agreement on whether commitments should be  listed in an annex or should appear within the Protocol. On  the need for Annex I Parties to prove 'demonstrable  progress' in the achievement of their commitments by the  year 2005, a delegation indicated that the term was unclear  and would be better fitted into another part of the  Protocol not dealing with QELROs.

In the final QELROs session held in the evening, a group of  countries proposed the deletion of articles on emissions  trading, activities implemented jointly and voluntary  commitments. Delegates spent a considerable portion of the  session debating an article on 'adequacy of implementation'  in the non-group Chair's revised text. One country proposed  returning to 'adequacy of commitments,' as in the original  text. Another preferred that adequacy of commitments be  included in the article on QELROs. There will be further  consultations on provisions related to countries with  economies in transition. One participant noted there was no  'real' discussion on emissions banking and borrowing.

# NON-GROUP ON INSTITUTIONS AND MECHANISMS

The group discussed legal aspects of the 'bubble' concept  for a shared emissions target for a group of countries. A  regional group presented its text, noting that the shared  target was a matter of compliance. Other delegations  objected. In an article defining the role of the COP and  Meeting of Parties (MOP), a group of countries proposed a  reference to an FCCC Article 7 provision that the COP can  review 'any related instrument.' The group offered to  produce an alternative text. Other delegations objected,  preferring to work from the revised non-group Chair's text.  The non-group planned an informal session Thursday to  review the article.

A group of countries requested restoration of bracketed  text requiring protocol parties to provide additional  funding in an article on Secretariat services to a  protocol. There was general agreement that an article on  subsidiary bodies should be aligned with the text on the  COP and MOP, but no final agreement was possible until the  other article is finalized.

A contact group presented language that the MOP shall  'approve appropriate and effective' non-compliance  procedures and mechanisms, but a number of delegations  objected. A group of countries said the non-compliance text  was linked to the decision on establishing a clean  development fund.

In a paragraph on amendments to a protocol, a delegation  proposed a footnote that amendments could only address  commitments under FCCC articles 4.2 (a), (b) and (d), and  another delegation suggested that approval of amendments  should be by double 2/3 majority. Delegates discussed possible meanings of  annexes, but a group of countries objected to use of  annexes and to attachments in a separate article on adding  non-Annex I Parties to the protocol.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Norway chaired a contact group on Article 10, on  commitments undertaken voluntarily. Opponents of the  Article continued to seek its deletion from the AGBM's  negotiating text. Those in favor argued that the content  represents an essential element of a protocol and a number  of amendments were introduced. These were designed to  clarify the requirements for consideration of requests to  be bound by the Article and a mechanism to oversee policies  and measures for those countries undertaking commitments  voluntarily. A number of developing countries continued to  state their opposition. A contact group involving the US  and the EU met to discuss their positions on emissions  trading (Article 5). The fate of this issue together with  joint implementation and credits continues to be linked to  the outcome of negotiations on QELROs.
