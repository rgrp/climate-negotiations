# SBI

### OPENING PLENARY AND ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

SBI Chair Ra√∫l  Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) opened the first meeting of SBI-16. In  an opening statement, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller- Hunter stressed a focus on implementation and noted the important  role of SBI in this context.

On the adoption of the agenda (FCCC/SBI/2002/1 and Add.1), CANADA  raised uncertainties over the status of the agenda item on  implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (minimization of adverse  effects), as noted in the opening meeting of the SBSTA. The G-77/CHINA, opposed by the EU and JAPAN, supported including this  item on the agenda. JAPAN requested that the item be suspended,  and SWITZERLAND noted that work could continue despite  disagreement on some agenda items. The US cautioned against  potential overlap between consideration of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and  4.9 (adverse effects) by SBI and consideration of the IPCC TAR by  SBSTA. He also proposed an additional agenda item entitled  'transparency in the UNFCCC process.' Adoption of the agenda was  deferred and Parties agreed to continue consideration of other  agenda items.

### ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

On national communications from  Annex I Parties, the Secretariat introduced a document on  consideration of the reviews of communications (FCCC/SBI/2002/3).  The document presents information on trends in greenhouse gas  emissions for Annex I Parties from 1990-99, and suggests options  for improving the process of considering national communications  and for the review process of countries' communications. Chair  Estrada invited Parties to comment on the document and make  suggestions for using national communications more effectively.

Observing that trends in emissions levels since 1990 left 'no  grounds for complacency,' the EU said the document's suggestions  merited further consideration, and proposed that draft conclusions  be considered at SB-17. CHINA, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted the  review of national communications as important work in which all  Parties should be involved. SWITZERLAND said the Secretariat's  suggestions deserved closer scrutiny. CANADA, the US and AUSTRALIA  stated that the current process works well, and opposed an  additional process or any modifications at this time. NORWAY  suggested linking SBSTA's work on policies and measures with SBI's  on national communications.

Regarding the status report on the review of third national  communications, Chair Estrada highlighted the report  (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.4) and remarked that the Secretariat will  prepare a compilation and synthesis report for SB-18, pending the  submission of additional national communications. Chair Estrada  will prepare draft conclusions on the agenda item for  consideration by SBI on Friday.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

On the work of the  Consultative Group of Experts (CGE) on national communications  from non-Annex I Parties, Chair Estrada drew delegates' attention  to reports on an experience-sharing workshop (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.3)  and on the fourth meeting of the CGE (FCCC/SBI/2002/2). CGE Chair  Isabelle Niang-Diop (Senegal) reported on CGE activities and  stressed the importance of financial and technical support for  preparing national communications. Consideration of the remaining  issues under this agenda item was deferred.

### PREPARATIONS FOR THE WSSD

Yahyaoui Abdelaziz (Morocco) reported  on preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development  (WSSD), indicating that negotiations on the means for  implementation remain unresolved. PAKISTAN, for the G-77/CHINA,  expressed the Group's commitment to the WSSD and noted concerns  that Parties were failing to fulfill their Rio commitments.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

On the review of the financial mechanism,  Chair Estrada invited Parties to provide feedback on the  performance of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). THAILAND,  for the G-77/CHINA, said he looked forward to the second review.  The EU supported the GEF's funding of medium-sized projects and  welcomed its effort to streamline the project cycle. CANADA hoped  the review would focus on a small number of practical  recommendations. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION stressed accountability.  Parties agreed to hold informal discussions chaired by Rawleston  Moore.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

The Secretariat  introduced a document on arrangements for intergovernmental  meetings (FCCC/SBI/2002/4) containing information on COP-8,  arrangements for the first Conference of the Parties serving as  the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP-1), the  programme for future sessions, the budget for conference services,  and COP-9.

On COP-8, the Secretariat suggested replacing the high-level  segment containing national statements with a round-table  discussion. The EU, NEW ZEALAND, SWITZERLAND and SAUDI ARABIA  advocated participation of ministers and heads of delegation.  Chair Estrada requested the COP Bureau to work on the round-table  issue, and consult on a list of items for the ministers to  discuss.

On arrangements for COP/MOP-1, the EU supported work on common  issues for the COP and COP/MOP and the definition of necessary  rules and procedures. CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY and AUSTRALIA  supported the use of existing UNFCCC rules of procedure, while  noting that one of the key rules has not yet been agreed.  AUSTRALIA opposed consolidated meetings.

On the programme for future sessions, the Secretariat highlighted  its concern about the growing number of workshops. The EU and  JAPAN called for an efficient process, with NORWAY proposing that  workshops be held immediately prior to sessions of the subsidiary  bodies. IRAN expressed concern it would impose a burden on small  delegations. Chair Estrada suggested prioritizing workshops and  improving workshop preparation.

On the budget for conference services, the US, JAPAN and CANADA  said conference expenses should be borne by the UNFCCC budget and  not the budget of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). ANTIGUA and  BARBUDA said the issue of conference financing from the UNGA  remained open.

On the issue of COP-9, Chair Estrada indicated that its venue has  not yet been determined.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

The Secretariat introduced  the report on the interim financial performance for the biennium  2002-2003 (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.5). She drew attention to the fact  that there were currently 190 contributions outstanding. Chair  Estrada said he would draft SBI conclusions on this item.

Regarding possible options for responding to late payment of  contributions, the Secretariat stated that publishing this  information encouraged timely payment, and drew attention to a  draft decision forwarded by SB-15 for adoption by COP-8.

On implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, Germany gave a  progress report, noting that plans for a UN campus and new  conference facilities in Bonn are moving ahead. UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Waller-Hunter welcomed the plans and thanked the German  Government.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

Delegates considered a draft COP-8 decision  on demonstrable progress under Protocol Article 3.2. The G-77/CHINA and AOSIS stressed concerns regarding evaluation of  progress made, and said they would provide a textual proposal.  Turning to draft SB-16 conclusions on guidelines under Articles 5,  7 and 8, CANADA cautioned that the parts of the guidelines that  remain pending might not be agreed at SB-16, and the conclusion  was amended to suggest forwarding a draft co-chairs' text that  would form the basis for work on the guidelines. The draft  conclusions stating that Parties would complete the technical  guidance for adjustments under Article 5.2 were amended to leave  flexibility for work to continue during COP-9, if necessary.

Parties considered the draft on Review of National Registries, to  be incorporated in the guidelines for review under Article 8. NEW  ZEALAND explained his proposed amendments, stressing, inter alia,  that the review process, which will be electronic, should not be  prejudged. He noted that the discussion on technical standards for  the exchange of data is ongoing.

### GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES

This contact group met in afternoon  and evening sessions, with delegates considering methodological  issues addressed in the report of an expert meeting to assess  experience in the use of the UNFCCC reporting and review  guidelines (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2 and Add.1).

In the evening, Co-Chair Audun Rosland reported that technical  consultations had resolved issues on the revised guidelines,  including those on source categories, editorial changes to the  appendix, and the CRF tables. Parties then revisited the reporting  guidelines. On the publication of CRFs on the Internet, the EU  said the UNFCCC website should contain CRFs to ensure a more  transparent process and provide efficient access to information.  NEW ZEALAND said the Secretariat should not be burdened with that  task. Parties then resumed discussion on the methodological annex,  with consultations continuing late into the night.

### ARTICLE 6

Co-Chair S. N. Sok Appadu introduced the Co-Chairs'  proposals for draft conclusions and a draft decision on a work  programme on Article 6. Parties discussed textual changes  paragraph-by-paragraph. PERU, opposed by BRAZIL, suggested linking  activities under Article 6 on climate change with similar  activities on local pollution problems. CANADA argued for  postponing debate on the proposed draft decision until SB-17 to  give Parties sufficient time to assess its potential implications.  A representative of the GEF urged careful consideration of  language regarding financial resources. Consultations continued  late into the night.

### IPCC TAR

Co-Chair Rawleston Moore introduced updated draft  conclusions, which he said attempted to incorporate the various  views expressed by Parties during previous contact group meetings.  A number of Parties, including the G-77/CHINA, EU, CANADA,  AUSTRALIA, US and JAPAN, said the text was a good basis for their  work, and stressed the need for a balanced approach.

Parties then considered the draft conclusions paragraph-by- paragraph. On text requesting the Secretariat to prepare a  document on using the TAR to facilitate consideration of routine  agenda items in the future, the G-77/CHINA proposed an amendment  to request submissions from Parties instead. With the SEYCHELLES,  he suggested that an additional six months would allow for a more  careful consideration of the TAR by developing countries. JAPAN,  AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND and other Annex I Parties questioned the  necessity of a further round of submissions, and preferred text  supporting action by the Secretariat in time for SB-17.

Following extensive comments by Parties on several of the  remaining paragraphs, Co-Chair Moore said a revised text taking  Parties' views into account would be presented on Tuesday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

It was back to the grind as delegates returned to the Maritim  Hotel on Monday morning, among them several newcomers sporting  suntanned faces indicating arrivals from Bali. Participants were  in a festive mood in the evening at a reception to celebrate the  tenth anniversary of the opening for signature of the UNFCCC.  Although a small group of negotiators missed the party due to a  session on the IPCC TAR that one participant described as  'fractious,' the buzz of conversation at the reception focused on  the matter of the SBI agenda, whose adoption was deferred earlier  in the day. Two agenda items by now familiar to all delegates  proved unacceptable to some Parties - the Canadian proposal on  cleaner or less-greenhouse gas emitting energy and the Saudi  Arabian proposal to include a discussion on Protocol Article 2.3.  Some delegates speculated how these two issues might be played  against each other on Tuesday.
