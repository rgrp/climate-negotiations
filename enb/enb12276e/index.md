# OPENING OF THE SESSION

IPCC Chair Rajendra Pachauri (India) opened the session and  welcomed delegates. Stéphane Dion, Minister of the Environment,  Canada, remarked on the importance of the IPCC, highlighted the  influence of the existing assessment reports, and suggested the  IPCC turn its attention to adaptation. He noted the importance of  the CCS Special Report given Canada's current and planned use of  CCS, and outlined Canada's preparations for the eleventh  Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-11/COP-MOP-1). He  stressed the importance of issues such as adaptation, carbon  markets, and technology to a successful outcome of the conference.

###

Chair Pachauri referred to the work scheduled for IPCC-24,  including consideration of a fifth assessment report. He said work  on the AR4 is at a critical juncture, cited policy relevance as  the reason for cross-cutting themes in the AR4, and highlighted  outreach and financial support as keys to future IPCC work.

###

Klaus Töpfer, UNEP Executive Director, emphasized the importance  of the CCS Special Report, noting that CCS has an important role  to play in addressing climate change. He referred to UNEP's  commitment to the IPCC, and stated that, in cooperation with the  World Meteorological Organization (WMO), UNEP could help to  disseminate the results of the AR4.

###

Hong Yan, Deputy Secretary-General, WMO, highlighted the  importance of the recent IPCC/TEAP Special Report on Safeguarding  the Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System (Ozone Special  Report), and encouraged the IPCC to work with WMO members to  disseminate it. On emission scenarios, he noted that future  scenarios should not only describe emissions but also look into  broader socioeconomic conditions, and that different approaches  might be needed for short and long-term scenarios. He also  encouraged increased participation during the expert review of the  first draft of the AR4.

###

Halldor Thorgeirsson, UNFCCC Secretariat, noted the relevance of  the CCS Special Report, the Ozone Special Report, and the AR4 to  policy making, and the importance of effective and balanced  outreach activities. He also noted the importance of the IPCC's  work on inventory guidelines and scenario development. He informed  delegates that the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body on Implementation had  forwarded a proposal to COP-11 to delay COP-13 by three weeks, to  allow further time for preparation of the AR4 Synthesis Report.

###

Delegates approved the provisional agenda. The US, AUSTRALIA and  the UK suggested early introduction of agenda items on emissions  scenarios, outreach and election procedures so that discussions  could be held in smaller groups during IPCC-24. The NETHERLANDS  stressed that outreach discussions could have budgetary  implications.

# APPROVAL OF THE IPCC-23 DRAFT REPORT

IPCC Secretary Renate Christ said only minor, editorial comments  were received on the draft IPCC-23 report, which was approved  without comment.

# APPROVAL OF WGIII-8 ACTIONS

WG III Co-Chair Ogunlade Davidson (Sierra Leone) introduced the  Summary for Policy Makers (SPM) of the CCS Special Report (8th WG  III/Doc. 2a, Rev. 1) and the Adjustments to the Technical Summary  and Chapters for consistency with the approved SPM (8th WG  III/Doc. 2c). WG III Co-Chair Bert Metz (the Netherlands) said  that constructive contributions during WGIII-8 had improved the  SPM. Delegates then approved the actions of WGIII-8.

###

GERMANY, with support from many countries and GREENPEACE, and  opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed the development of a special  report on renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and  BELGIUM suggested inclusion of this issue on the agenda for  IPCC-25. AUSTRALIA, the UK, the NETHERLANDS, and BANGLADESH said  that given the timing and substance of the AR4, the IPCC  guidelines for the commencement of special reports, and resource  constraints, it is not appropriate to consider such a special  report at this time.

###

HUNGARY, AUSTRALIA, AUSTRIA, CANADA, NORWARY and the NETHERLANDS  noted the importance of outreach on the CCS Special Report. The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION suggested that a sub-title be included in the  CCS Special Report, noting that it was prepared with a view to  addressing climate change. No further action was taken on this  issue.

###

IPCC Secretary Christ outlined outreach activities on the CCS  Special Report already underway. Chair Pachauri said timing and  capacity constraints relating to the AR4 mean it is prudent to  wait until its release before considering a special report on  renewable energy and energy efficiency, and noted that outreach  activities would be addressed later in the IPCC-24 agenda.

# IPCC PROGRAMME AND BUDGET FOR 2006-08

Introducing the budget, Chair Pachauri urged delegations to step  up revenue flows. IPCC Secretary Christ presented the IPCC  Programme and Budget for 2006-08 (IPCC-XXIV/Doc.4), highlighting  that the annual rate of contributions for recent years was around,  or slightly above, annual expenditures, but below the annual  budget approved by the Panel.

###

During the lunch break, the Financial Task Team, co-chaired by  Marc Gillet (France) and Zhenlin Chen (China), convened  consultations on this issue. Discussion centered on lower than  expected expenditures. The Secretariat and the Technical Support  Units (TSU) explained that some meetings were postponed or  scheduled with other meetings, and that host countries often  provide support. The UK, with GERMANY and others, said governments  needed guidance on required contributions. The group will  reconvene on Tuesday morning.

# PROGRESS REPORTS

## Working Group I

Susan Solomon (US), WG I Co-Chair, presented on  progress towards the AR4, noting that the second Lead Author  meeting for WG I had taken place in Beijing, China, from 10-12 May  2005, and that the first order drafts of all chapters of the WG I  report had been received. She explained that an extensive list of  potential expert reviewers had been compiled from various sources,  including a publicly available web page to allow for open  registration, and that initial contact had been made with more  than 1,000 potential reviewers, with over 400 now confirmed. She  noted that the Ozone Special Report is being printed, and that the  Uncertainty Guidance Note for authors is available on the IPCC  website.

###     Working Group II

Osvaldo Canziani (Argentina), WG II Co-Chair,  said progress included the submission of the WG II first order  draft and the commencement of its expert review, and the initial  drafting of the Technical Summary and the Summary for Policy  Makers. He highlighted the development of a regional database on  source material used in the WG II fourth assessment, and plans for  a joint meeting at COP-11 of WG II and WG III on the cross-cutting  issue of adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development. Given  time constraints related to preparation of the AR4 and the  importance of the subject matter, Canziani requested, and  delegates agreed, to postpone delivery of the Technical Paper on  Water for six-months.

###     Working Group III

WG III Co-Chair Metz presented the WG III  progress report, and said the CCS Special Report should be ready  by the end of 2005. He noted progress on the WG III first order  draft, with the third Lead Author meeting to take place in  Beijing, China, in February 2006, and said that a web-based  Virtual Coordination Group had been created to further discuss the  WG II and WG III cross-cutting issue of adaptation, mitigation and  sustainable development. Metz also noted an expert meeting in  Washington DC, US, in January 2005, on emission scenarios used in  the AR4, and one in Laxemburg, Austria, in June 2005, on new  emission scenarios.

###     AR4 Synthesis Report

Chair Pachauri informed delegates of: the  arrangements for management of the AR4 Synthesis Report; the  results of a meeting of the IPCC Bureau Co-Chairs and Heads of the  TSU in Baarn, the Netherlands; and the budgetary implications of  the AR4 Synthesis Report, estimated at SF 634,000. On a question  from SLOVENIA about the content and form of the AR4 Synthesis  Report, Chair Pachauri noted these issues were decided at IPCC-22.  AUSTRIA requested that explicit reference be made in the meeting  minutes to the need to postpone COP-13 by three weeks.

###     Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate  Assessment

TGICA Co-Chair Richard Moss (US) highlighted the  problems posed by lack of data in specific regions or sectors, and  by the need for training and capacity building in developing  countries. He outlined TGICA's proposal to enhance capacity in  developing nations, as contained in the TGICA's progress report.  Delegates endorsed the proposal, based on the understanding that  the TGICA will act as a facilitator but will not, itself, provide  training.

# NATIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES PROGRAMME

Taka Hiraishi (Japan), Co-Chair of the Task Force on NGGIP,  presented progress reports on the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for  National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (2006 Guidelines) and Emission  Factors Database, and on further work on aerosols. He noted that  progress on the 2006 Guidelines is on schedule, and that the  importance of the Emission Factors Database should increase as the  2006 Guidelines advance. On aerosols, he presented the report of  the expert meeting on Emission Estimation of Aerosols Relevant to  Climate Change, and a proposal for a follow-up meeting.

###

FRANCE and GERMANY questioned whether work on aerosols is  sufficiently advanced to give rise to work on inventories. The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION noted the importance of continuing work, but  questioned whether understanding of aerosols is adequately  developed. Citing a 'uniform expression of doubt' regarding how to  proceed, Chair Pachauri postponed further discussion of this item  until Tuesday.

# ELECTION PROCEDURES

David Warrilow (UK) and Richard Odingo (Kenya), co-chaired the  discussions on election procedures for the IPCC Bureau and Task  Force Bureau. IPCC Secretary Christ explained the draft procedures  for line-by-line discussion. After requests from several delegates  for copies of the revised text, the discussion was postponed until  Tuesday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

After the late nights and detailed nature of deliberations towards  the end of WGIII-8, the tone of the opening day of IPCC-24  appeared more relaxed. Some delegates speculated that the second  day of IPCC-24 might be more intensive, particularly given that a  number of potentially controversial issues were held over for  discussion until later in the meeting.

###

Along with the timing of the AR4 Synthesis Report, attention both  in the corridors and in plenary shifted to consideration of  election procedures, emission scenarios, aerosols, outreach and  the budget. One issue that caught the passing attention of many  delegates was Minister Dion's reference to COP-11 and COP/MOP-1 as  the 'Climate Change Conference.' Most thought this was simply a  matter of word choice, but one observer wondered if the changing  terminology represented a desire to shift the attention towards  'climate change' more generally.
