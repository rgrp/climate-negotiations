# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### MECHANISMS

This group met in the morning to consider the Co- Chairs' non-paper, which is a consolidation of the political  decision, The Hague text, the Pronk text, and text agreed in the  technical working groups. Co-Chair Chow noted that two technical  working groups were meeting on: mechanisms eligibility and  verification procedures of joint implementation (JI) track two  projects, and the Article 6 (JI) project cycle; and the CDM.  Participants discussed the interface with the LULUCF negotiating  group, noting that this group would be responsible for substantive  issues on LULUCF activities in the mechanisms. A group of Annex I  Parties stressed the need to focus also on Article 17 (emissions  trading). The morning meeting was adjourned, with work continuing  in the technical working groups.

The negotiating group reconvened in the evening and received  feedback from the technical working groups. Chair Miguez of the  CDM group noted the state of progress on new methodologies,  monitoring, registries, and the approval of host parties, on which  disagreement remained. Chair Ward of the second technical working  group noted that delegates had not fully addressed the composition  of the supervisory committee or the JI appendices. He said issues  relating to eligibility and the treatment of LULUCF, and issues  linked to Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information), would need to be  addressed at COP-7. A group of Annex I Parties requested that  their text on the JI appendices be included in the report. Co- Chair Estrada said this text should be submitted separately.

Co-Chair Estrada noted that the draft decisions on mechanisms have  been reformulated to reflect the political decision. A grouping of  Annex I Parties said an error had been made in the decision on  eligibility, which now included reference to the 'legal' agreement  on compliance. A number of other Annex I Parties urged consistency  to reflect the political decision's section on compliance.

Co-Chair Estrada said the Co-Chairs' non-paper would be revised to  reflect the progress of the group, and would be presented to the  Plenary Friday. This would not replace The Hague or the Pronk  texts.

### FINANCE

The negotiating group on finance met in several sessions  throughout Thursday to address outstanding text for draft  decisions on UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article 3.14  (adverse effects), technology transfer and funding.

###     Adverse Effects:

In the morning, Co-Chair Tsering introduced the  informal paper on Article 4.8 and 4.9. Parties discussed at length  the phrasing of a chapeau on financial support to activities  addressing adverse effects, and finally agreed to text providing  that activities can be funded by the special climate change fund  'and/or' the adaptation fund, as well as other bilateral and  multilateral sources.

Delegates also discussed text on establishing a disaster fund for  climate-induced disaster relief for vulnerable developing  countries. Several Annex I Parties expressed concern about  extending funding to disaster relief, particularly its impact on  funding for other purposes. Reference to this issue was deleted.

On Article 3.14, delegates discussed a paragraph on the  progressive reduction or phasing out of market imperfections,  fiscal incentives, tax and duty exemptions and subsidies in all  greenhouse gas emitting sectors. One participant said this wording  was taken from Protocol Article 2.1(a)(v) and should therefore  include the complete text from that Article. Others cautioned that  this would unsettle the 'political package' and said the Ministers  had purposely omitted the remainder of the Article. A small  drafting group was convened to address the remaining bracketed  text not directly affected by the political decision. The  negotiating group met again in the evening and approved the draft  decisions for consideration by the COP Friday.

###     Funding:

Parties met in an informal group Thursday afternoon and  evening to draft decisions on funding under the GEF and under the  special climate change fund, the adaptation fund, and other  bilateral and multilateral sources. The draft decisions were  agreed in the evening.

###     Technology Transfer:

The informal group concluded its work,  clearing all remaining brackets.

### COMPLIANCE

During a morning meeting, Co-Chair Slade suggested  that delegates proceed through the Co-Chairs' non-paper on  procedures and mechanisms on compliance under the Protocol. On the  draft COP decision, delegates discussed legal and political issues  related to the paragraph whereby the COP adopts the procedures and  mechanisms on compliance annexed thereto. Several Annex I Parties  suggested deleting this paragraph, arguing that the mandate given  by Ministers had already been fulfilled through the adoption of  the political decision on Wednesday, 25 July, and that the COP had  no legal authority to adopt procedures and mechanisms relating to  compliance under the Protocol. They added that although further  work was required on this issue, it only had to be conducted in  time for a COP/MOP-1 decision. They also suggested that, according  to the political decision, the compliance procedures and  mechanisms to be elaborated would not be legally binding. Other  Annex I Parties and developing countries said the political  decision instructs delegates to negotiate and adopt, during the  second week of COP-6 Part II, a balanced package of further  decisions, and that UNFCCC Article 7.2. (functions of the COP)  provides the legal basis for the adoption of such a decision on  compliance procedures and mechanisms. They added that the  political decision leaves open the issue of whether the compliance  procedures and mechanisms, to be adopted by COP/MOP-1, will be  legally binding or not.

Going through the remainder of the non-paper, delegates made a  number of drafting and substantial suggestions. On the role of the  COP/MOP, proposals were made, inter alia, on: whether the  Compliance Committee would 'follow,' 'consider' or 'apply' the  COP's general policy guidance; whether a panel established by the  COP/MOP would consider the reports of expert review teams; and  whether the COP/MOP would 'adopt' or merely 'consider' the report  of the Compliance Committee.

On elements regarding the facilitative branch, discussions related  to, inter alia: the scope of the Protocol provisions falling  within the mandate of the facilitative branch; how the  facilitative branch would consider issues relating to Article 3.14  (adverse effects); and whether there should be provision for EITs  to receive financial and technical assistance.  On issues with  regard to the enforcement branch, delegates considered, inter  alia: whether consequences other than the suspension of the  eligibility to use the mechanisms may be applied in case of non- compliance with Articles 5.1 (national systems) 5.2 (adjustments),  7.1 (inventories) and 7.4 (guidelines for the communication of  information); whether a Party may submit questions of  implementation with regard to another Party; whether mechanisms'  eligibility requirements only apply to Annex I Parties; what would  be the status of the enforcement branch decision pending the  decision on appeal; whether references to 'shall' should be  replaced with 'should'; whether the consequences in case of non- compliance with Article 3.1(assigned amounts) will apply  individually to each country under Article 4 (joint fulfillment);  and whether the suspension of the eligibility to make transfers  also applies to Article 6 (JI).

On completing the reading of the non-paper, Co-Chair Slade  emphasized the fundamental disagreements among Parties and  suggested that a small group convene to attempt to resolve them.  Developing countries and many Annex I Parties expressed doubts  about the possible positive outcome of such a group and suggested  the intervention of President Pronk on the way forward, while  several Annex I Parties said they were willing to continue their  work. One developing country delegate said it was rare to see  delegates trying to unravel an agreement reached at the highest  level. He expressed his 'deep disappointment and frustration' as  well as his concern about the outcome of COP-6 Part II. A group of  Annex I Parties said its understanding of the political 'deal' was  that in return for not having a separate legally binding  compliance regime now, a further elaborated text on compliance  would be adopted by the end of this session. Concluding the  meeting, Co-Chair Slade said he would report to President Pronk  and the Bureau.

### LULUCF

The negotiating group met in afternoon and evening  sessions, with a smaller drafting group convening throughout the  day. In the afternoon session, drafting group co-facilitators  Thorgeirsson and Fischlin reported on progress. They said only  sections where the political decision had been ambiguous required  further consultation, and identified as such the question of  whether the draft decision refers to eligibility of LULUCF  activities under Article 12 (CDM) only in the first commitment  period, or whether it also applies to future commitment periods.  Other issues included the Russian Federation's proposal for an  amendment to its cap on forest management credits contained in  Appendix Z, and additional concerns regarding Party caps.

Several Parties requested that their caps be adjusted, with one  suggesting all caps be recalculated. The co-facilitators noted two  Parties had inadvertently been omitted from Appendix Z. Several  delegates stressed the need to maintain the integrity of the  Ministers' decision. One Party wished to be removed from Appendix  Z. The Russian proposal was further elaborted as a 33 Mt C/yr  entry in Appendix Z.

Co-Chair Dovland noted that issues identified that could not be  resolved by the negotiating group would be presented to President  Pronk for his guidance, and Appendix Z would not be opened at this  time. Six requests with regard to Appendix Z would be referred to  President Pronk, as well as questions regarding the cap on credits  to offset Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and  deforestation) debits, and the applicability of the decision on  eligibility of LULUCF activities under Article 12 beyond the first  commitment period. The drafting group agreed on the Co-Chairs'  decisions in the evening with the exception of the issues to be  referred to President Pronk.

# INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

A contact  group convened in the afternoon to discuss and approve draft  conclusions on cooperation with relevant international  organizations, focusing on text regarding cooperation with other  conventions. The group agreed, inter alia, to text on enhancing  coordination and exchange of relevant information between the  UNFCCC, the CBD, and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification.

### CONSULTATIVE GROUP OF EXPERTS

Delegates convened in the afternoon  for a Friends of the SBI Chair meeting to consider information  contained in a preliminary report of the Consultative Group of  Experts. Draft conclusions will be considered in the SBI Friday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Much of the talk in the corridors Thursday evening was on the  progress of the various negotiating groups in clearing the  numerous remaining draft decisions and accompanying texts. While  success was reported in areas such as technology transfer,  funding, LULUCF and adverse effects, talks on the mechanisms  appeared to be moving at a less impressive pace, while those on  compliance seemed to be stalled. An overriding disagreement that  resurfaced concerns the legal nature of the procedures and  mechanisms relating to compliance. While several participants at  COP-6 Part II felt some Parties were trying to reinterpret  Monday's result, sympathizers said the caution in some of  Thursday's groups reflected a concern that the talks were running  the risk of rushing through texts that could consequently be  error-laden. Although talks were ongoing late Thursday night,  there was a feeling that in spite of some progress, completing  work on all remaining texts by the end of Friday could be an  unrealistic aim. Delegates were also discussing rumors of a  possible proposal to continue the meeting into Saturday in an  effort to finish the work.
