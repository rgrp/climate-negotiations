abstract: "The Seminar of Governmental Experts was held on 16 and 17 May  2005, at the Maritim Hotel in Bonn, Germany. The decision to hold  a Seminar was taken by Parties at the Tenth Conference of the  Parties (COP-10) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) in December 2004. The decision, which followed lengthy  discussions at COP-10, sought to address the question of how to  engage on some of the broader issues facing the climate change  process. Foremost among these for some Parties was the question of  a future framework and commitments to combat climate change in the  post-2012 period (the Kyoto Protocol sets emissions targets for  the years 2008-2012). There was also some interest in other  issues, such as how to respond to the increasingly strong evidence  of climate change, address the differences of opinion over Kyoto,  and move forward in dealing both with climate change mitigation  and adaptation."
---

The issue of a post-2012 framework proved to be particularly  sensitive at COP-10. While the Kyoto Protocol requires Parties to  begin considering the post-2012 period by 2005, many developing  countries have objected in the past to attempts to expand the  group of nations that have binding emissions targets from Annex I  Parties into the ranks of the Group of 77 and China (G-77/China).  Developing countries argue that industrialized countries should  take the lead, based on the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities. There was also the question of how to include  non-Parties to Kyoto in talks on subsequent commitments.

As a result of these concerns, the terms of reference set for the  Seminar were kept broad and general, with no specific reference to  a post-2012 framework or other controversial matters. Parties at  COP-10 agreed that the Seminar should encourage an 'informal  exchange of information on: (a) actions relating to mitigation and  adaptation to assist Parties to continue to develop effective and  appropriate responses to climate change; and (b) policies and  measures adopted by their respective governments that support  implementation of their existing commitments.' While the Seminar had no formal outcome, such as recommendations  or a negotiated text, many participants felt that it had been a  very constructive and open dialogue that had demonstrated a  willingness among Parties to understand others' positions and  circumstances, and to begin the search for innovative ways to  accommodate them. However, while being widely viewed as a step in  the right direction, there were few signs that the differences  between Parties had actually narrowed.

# REPORT OF THE SEMINAR

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter welcomed  participants to the Seminar of Governmental Experts on Monday  morning, 16 May. Stating that this Seminar was the 'first of its  kind in UNFCCC history,' she said time would tell if it will be  remembered as an historic event. She suggested that, following the  entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005, this was  an opportune moment to consider the implementation of the UNFCCC  and Kyoto Protocol. She said participants would be informed about  the broad range of approaches Parties have taken to tackle climate  change, reflecting countries' diverse circumstances, and  highlighted that the Seminar was taking place against a backdrop  of rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations.

Delegates then heard two keynote presentations. Jürgen Trittin,  German Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation  and Nuclear Safety, highlighted the need for action on climate  change to avoid a rise of more than 2?C in global temperatures and  the 'disastrous and irreversible damage' that would result. He  stated that the Kyoto Protocol is a first step, but said progress  must continue beyond 2012. He underscored the need for political  will to ensure climate protection, and said this Seminar could  provide the basis for a successful start at the first Meeting of  the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (MOP-1) in December 2005, with  regard to the process of developing a post-2012 framework.

COP-10 President Ginés González García, Minister of Health and the  Environment of Argentina, said the Seminar was an opportunity to  rebuild trust and confidence, noting the challenge of designing  and building the post-2012 structures. He urged industrialized  countries to address developing countries' concerns, including  turning pledges into concrete actions, supporting the various  climate funds that exist, and engaging in technology transfer and  supporting adaptation. He indicated that political will would be  critical to building trust and 'facilitating developing countries'  active participation in post-Kyoto architecture.' Following the opening presentations, Co-Chair Masaki Konishi  explained that the Seminar would consist of several sessions, each  involving speeches from several different government experts,  followed by an interactive question-and-answer period. Emphasizing  the informal nature of this meeting, Co-Chair Chow Kok Kee said  there would be no Co-Chairs' conclusions.

# SESSION ONE

The first session, held on Monday morning, 16 May, involved  presentations by government experts from China, Brazil,  Switzerland and the UK, followed by an interactive question-and- answer session.

## PRESENTATIONS

### China:

Feng Gao drew attention to China's current  reliance on coal, stressed the need to improve energy efficiency,  and outlined China's efforts to optimize its energy structure. He  called for international cooperation to introduce and apply energy  saving technologies, corresponding policy incentives and capacity  building, and increased efforts and new mechanisms to transfer  such technologies to developing countries.

###     Brazil

André Corrêa do Lago urged cooperation to ensure the  success of the UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol and the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) beyond 2012. Outlining Brazil's experiences with  the CDM, he highlighted the CDM's contribution in achieving the  UNFCCC's objective, helping Annex I countries to meet their  commitments, engaging developing countries in mitigation efforts  that would not otherwise be feasible, while raising their living  standards.

###     Switzerland

Beat Nobs recognized the need to increase efforts to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions after 2012. He said the  international framework should ensure sustainable development,  include all major emitters, reduce greenhouse gas emissions  everywhere, promote the development, use and transfer of  environmentally friendly technology, make use of market forces,  and possibly include timetables and targets for emissions  reductions.

###     United Kingdom

David Warrilow, on behalf of the European Union  (EU), underscored positive feedback and possible catastrophic  impacts as drivers for the EU's proposal to limit warming to less  than 2?C, emphasizing that the challenge is to meet growing demand  for energy while reducing emissions. He also stressed the need to  address the problem as a matter of urgency.

### DISCUSSION

Japan welcomed China's emphasis on energy savings and  efficiency, asked for details on how China plans to achieve these,  and offered technology cooperation. In response, Feng Gao stressed  China's need for energy, noting that, with hydro and nuclear  energy both being criticized, it raised issues about what options  China had. He added that a strong agreement on technology transfer  would be necessary.

The Cook Islands and Indonesia raised issues about the future role  of the CDM and Joint Implementation (JI), and Luxembourg, for the  EU, asked Brazil about its renewables programme. In response,  André Corrêa do Lago said Brazil has demonstrated that it is  possible for a developing country to have a very high ratio of  renewable energy in the matrix.

China raised the question of when developed countries could be  expected to show significant reductions in greenhouse gas  emissions and set an example for developing countries. Romania  raised questions about the role of nuclear power in the second  commitment period. He noted the risk of positive feedback, such as  emissions from manufacturing the cement needed for sea walls and  other infrastructure to adapt to sea level rise.

# SESSION TWO

This session, held early Monday afternoon, involved presentations  from South Africa, Norway, the European Commission and the US,  followed by a question-and-answer session.

## PRESENTATIONS

### South Africa

Alf Wills said the future should  involve a strengthened Kyoto Protocol that includes all countries  and recognizes their common but differentiated responsibilities.  He stressed that the science of adaptation is relatively  underdeveloped, highlighted that mitigation and adaptation in  South Africa is an 'energy story,' and called for a 'roadmap' for  negotiations to be developed at COP-11/MOP-1 in Montreal in late  2005.

###     Norway

Harald Dovland underscored that 2012 is only seven years  away, a very short time given the long planning periods needed for  many sectors. Commenting on the shape of a future climate regime,  he said it should contain the Kyoto Protocol's positive elements,  such as differentiated commitments, flexibility and reporting.

###     European Commission

Artur Runge-Metzger outlined the EU's  progress in achieving the Kyoto targets, stressing its emphasis on  cost-effective policies, a multi-stakeholder approach, and the use  of market-based instruments, regulations and standards, labeling  and voluntary measures. He reported on the EU's Emissions Trading  Scheme (ETS), which allows linking with Joint Implementation (JI)  and the CDM. He also noted work on the aviation sector, carbon  capture and storage, and adaptation.

###     United States

Harlan Watson outlined his country's policies to  address climate change, stressing its commitment to the UNFCCC and  the need for sustained efforts by all nations across generations.  Noting President Bush's 'ambitious goal' to reduce greenhouse gas  intensity by 18 percent from 2002-2012, he noted progress to date,  with slightly lower emissions in 2003 than 2000 in spite of  population growth and a significant rise in gross domestic product  (GDP). He emphasized the US commitment to engaging fully at the  international level and to sustainable development, noting  initiatives on carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, nuclear  energy and methane recovery and use.

### DISCUSSION

Responding to a question from Luxembourg about  existing technologies, Harlan Watson agreed that these had an  important role. In response to a comment from Bolivia on the role  of forestry in reducing climate change impacts, Artur Runge- Metzger noted that the sector was only partially dealt with under  the Kyoto Protocol, as deforestation was not adequately addressed.  Harlan Watson emphasized sequestration focused on forests and  farmland. Harald Dovland noted that he had not been especially  satisfied with how forestry and sinks issues had been addressed  under the Kyoto Protocol, and hoped that in future regimes they  would be dealt with through constructive discussions. Alf Wills  noted concerns that South Africa's particular conditions,  including its water limitations, meant forestry issues are  considered more in terms of vulnerability and adaptation than  carbon sinks.

Responding to Bulgaria's question about the exclusion of aviation  from the Kyoto Protocol, Artur Runge-Metzger said the European  Commission was considering this complex issue, and that aviation  should be addressed in a future climate regime. Harlan Watson  noted that the aviation sector is experiencing growth in some  parts of the world, although not in the US. Harold Dovland noted  discussions on this issue in the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) and the EU.

Indonesia asked about the post-2012 period. Artur Runge-Metzger  indicated that neither the EU ETS Directive nor the Linking  Directive to the CDM and JI have an expiration date. Harold  Dovland said care must be taken not to establish a regime that is  so complex that compliance cannot be monitored effectively. He  expressed a personal view that a future framework should involve  multiple stakeholders, rather than 'the dichotomous world of Annex  I and non-Annex I' Parties.

# SESSION THREE

This session, which took place on Monday afternoon, included  speeches from Tuvalu, Albania, the Republic of Korea and the  Netherlands, as well as a question-and-answer session.

## PRESENTATIONS

### Tuvalu:

Ian Fry said Annex B countries should focus  on energy efficiency and renewable energy and that countries that  are not Parties to the Kyoto Protocol should reduce their  emissions levels. He called for a renewable energy and energy  efficiency technology fund to assist non-Annex I countries in  reducing emissions and purchasing the necessary technologies. He  also opposed nuclear power as an option. Fry said adaptation  measures should focus both on building resistance to the impacts  of climate change, and on restoring the damage caused by its  impacts. He highlighted the need for a new financial facility for  adaptation funding, but said there was no need for an adaptation  protocol.

###     Albania

Ermira Fida said Albania's First National Communication  has been used to mainstream climate change into national policies,  including the development of the national energy strategy and  identifying ways to meet technology needs.

###     Republic of Korea

Boo Nam Shin noted that energy demand is  projected to grow both in the Republic of Korea and globally. He  highlighted international cooperation based on the principle of  common but differentiated responsibilities, and called for the  development and diffusion of more efficient technologies, and  technological assistance for non-Annex I countries.

###     The Netherlands

Yvo de Boer speaking for the EU, focused on  policy integration, noting increasing energy consumption. He  underscored the need to make emissions reductions economically  attractive, and to use the lessons learned from the Kyoto  Protocol. He said the international community should take  advantage of the synergies between combating climate change and  achieving development.

### DISCUSSION

In the subsequent discussion, India asked for  clarification on the new approaches to differentiation among  Parties, and Yvo de Boer said these should be built on the UNFCCC  framework. Pakistan highlighted the role of renewable energy  sources in economic empowerment of the poor and Samoa stressed the  importance of renewable energy technology transfer. Ian Fry called  for discussions on how to engage more effectively with  international financial institutions and to evolve in a way that  meets poverty reduction requirements as well as emissions  reduction requirements.

# SESSION FOUR

This session, which was held late Monday afternoon, included  presentations from Canada, Japan, Morocco and India, as well as a  question-and-answer session.

## PRESENTATIONS

### Canada:

Norine Smith reported on Project Green,  which sets out steps to ensure that Canada can meet its Kyoto  commitments. She underscored Project Green's focus on market  mechanisms, a partnerships fund, large emitters, information for  Canadian consumers, carbon sequestration and environmentally- sustainable infrastructure. She also highlighted mounting evidence  for climate change and a realization that that much more needs to  be done beyond Kyoto, with climate change already occurring and  affecting communities such as those in northern Canada. Outlining  preparations for COP-11/MOP-1 in Montreal, she drew attention to  the pre-meeting consultative process, welcoming advice and input  to help move the climate process forward and to operationalize the  Kyoto Protocol.

###     Japan

Mutsuyoshi Nishimura drew attention to Japan's new plan to  implement its Kyoto commitments, describing it as a 'huge package'  of measures involving various stakeholders. Stressing that climate  change is real and that delays in dealing with it will lead to  further damage, he highlighted technological innovation, on which  Japan has taken a leading role, and also advocated global action.  He supported a free and frank dialogue and a 'new paradigm' that  was 'encouraging and enabling' rather than 'capping and  punishing.' He supported a roadmap to a low carbon society.

###     Morocco

Taha Balafrej highlighted Morocco's vulnerability to  climate change, including its impact on precipitation and water  supply. On the way forward, he said Morocco would entertain any  proposal to combat global warming in a substantial way. He  stressed that commitments from all developed countries are needed,  highlighted business sector concerns about the economic impacts of  climate change, suggested making this process less complicated and  more flexible, and called for procedures for the CDM to be  streamlined. He also urged greater efforts on adaptation.

###     India

Surya P. Sethi stated that emissions in Annex I countries  are rising and that their reductions have not resulted from new  climate policies and measures but from 'one time' events such as  the economic transition in Eastern Europe, and the shift from coal  to gas in the UK. He emphasized the limits of different models  forecasting emissions trends and drew attention to the barriers to  technology transfer and financing. He noted that India's low  emissions levels do not result only from poverty but that they can  also be attributed to lifestyle choices.

### DISCUSSION

Responding to questions from various participants  concerning technology transfer, Surya P. Sethi highlighted that  the transfer of certain technologies should be moved to the public  domain, as the speed of commercially-driven technology transfer  will be insufficient to affect climate change in any meaningful  way, due to the lack of resources in developing countries. Taha  Balafrej underscored the need to have a clear picture of the  efforts made to date by developed countries, and the results  achieved. He noted the need to improve the system and equity in  CDM project distribution, emphasizing Africa's under- representation. Responding to a question from Germany on the  inclusion of the private sector in reducing carbon emissions,  Mutsuyoshi Nishimura explained about Japan's voluntary programme  and Norine Smith reported on Canada's consultation with large  emitters, which resulted in an emissions intensity approach.  Responding to a question from the UK on their long-term climate  policy perspectives, Mutsuyoshi Nishimura and Norine Smith  underscored that long-term planning is needed to secure the  necessary investments in infrastructure. Mutsuyoshi Nishimura  noted Japan's significant investments in energy efficiency and  conservation over many years. Norine Smith said the similarities  in different countries' approaches probably reflect the influence  of academic literature.

# SESSION FIVE

On Tuesday morning, 17 May, delegates heard presentations from  government experts from Papua New Guinea, Mexico, Australia and  France, and engaged in a question-and-answer session.

## PRESENTATIONS

### Papua New Guinea:

Robert G. Aisi underscored that  the Kyoto Protocol excludes action by developing countries to  avoid deforestation. He proposed an optional protocol with  tradable credits issued against avoided deforestation, and  questioned whether the Marrakesh Accords should be amended.

###     Mexico

Fernando Tudela said a signal should be given to the  markets on the future of the climate regime, and raised the  possibility of a 'Montreal Mandate' at COP-11/MOP-1. He suggested  that further differentiation among developing countries was  necessary, and introduced the idea of flexible convergence of per  capita emissions. While noting some positive aspects of the CDM,  he listed various concerns, including transaction costs and an  imbalance between environmental integrity and effectiveness.

###     Australia

Jan Adams said the major emitters should take action to  reduce emissions and identified the growing global energy demand  as a major challenge. She highlighted cooperation on the  development of both renewable energy and cleaner fossil fuel  technologies, and identified thermal power generation, carbon  sequestration and clean coal technologies as promising  alternatives.

###     France

Paul Watkinson, on behalf of the EU, focused on the  investment challenge. He highlighted the need to influence private  investment decisions and emphasized the importance of integrating  climate in other policies, the role of trade regimes and the World  Trade Organization, and noted that post-2012 uncertainty is  already affecting carbon markets.

### DISCUSSION

In the ensuing discussion, Monaco said per capita  emissions should be a relevant consideration in determining future  commitments. Egypt, the Russian Federation, Monaco and others  underscored problems with the CDM, including its complexity.  Morocco noted that, while the CDM needs to be improved, it does  link action on climate change to development. Fernando Tudela  suggested that the CDM could focus on economic sectors and that  sectoral baselines be developed.

Hungary and Japan asked what was meant by differentiation among  developing countries, and Fernando Tudela replied that if a  country can do more to reduce emissions then it should do so, thus  avoiding a 'race to the bottom.' Morocco proposed that the  Secretariat put up a Carbon Thermometer on its website, based on  Annex I national contributions, to increase the visibility of  carbon emissions. The Russian Federation highlighted the need for  post-2012 certainty to encourage private sector investment. Tuvalu  raised the issue of small developing country participation in the  climate process. Paul Watkinson observed that, as a result of the  EU ETS, businesses in the EU are aware of their emissions levels.

# SESSION SIX

On Tuesday morning, delegates heard presentations from New  Zealand, Germany, Argentina and Finland, and engaged in a  question-and-answer session.

## PRESENTATIONS

### New Zealand

Helen Plume noted her country's  responses to climate change, including a carbon tax to be  introduced in 2007. She drew attention to New Zealand's unique  circumstances and highlighted the need for flexible solutions,  while emphasizing that all the major emitters should be involved  in the process and that broad participation is essential.

###     Germany

Karsten Sach, on behalf of the EU, spoke about technology  and innovation. Highlighting the need to find ways to bring  technologies to the market, he outlined a range of 'push and pull'  policies, and discussed the role of public-private partnerships.  He said the Kyoto framework serves as a good basis for the post- 2012 period, and stressed that there should be no gap in the  process.

###     Argentina

Vicente R. Barros acknowledged warnings about the 2?C  global warming threshold, and noted that warming is expected to be  greater in some tropical and sub-tropical areas, with impacts on,  inter alia, precipitation, water supplies, hydro power and  agriculture. He stressed the importance of taking action on the  post-2012 period, arguing that 'we must start now' to discuss  these issues. He highlighted the importance of the CDM and said  its scope should be expanded. He also discussed the important  roles of carbon sequestration and reforestation.

###     Finland

Outi Berghäll stressed the urgency of adaptation, and  called for the integration of climate change and adaptation into  development policies, as well as into national and subnational  decision-making. She emphasized the need to enhance cross-sectoral  communication, avoid duplication of efforts, and find synergies  between international institutions and other multilateral  environmental agreements.

### DISCUSSION

Responding to a question from Hungary on long-term  goals, Helen Plume indicated that New Zealand has not adopted a  long-term global warming target, but accepted that international  consensus on such a target would provide greater certainty for the  business sector. Responding to a question from Pakistan, Karsten  Sach highlighted the value of networking to promote renewable  energy, and agreed with Kenya on the need to build capacity for  Africa to participate more effectively in the CDM. Vicente R.  Barros identified the need for mechanisms to encourage larger  emissions reductions and further develop the CDM. Responding to  Kenya, Outi Berghäll said the recognition of differences in the  impacts of climate change on countries must be the starting point  for adaptation, and that responses must be tailored to fit  national circumstances.

# PRESENTATIONS FROM CIVIL SOCIETY

Representatives of civil society groups were invited to speak  early on Tuesday afternoon. Nick Campbell, representing the  business and industry organizations at the Seminar, emphasized the  willingness of the business community to continue to participate  in climate efforts and urged Parties to consider the wider impacts  of climate policies.

Sanjay Vashist, Climate Action Network, underscored that climate  change is already having an impact, and said a mandate for  negotiations on the post-2012 period must come out of COP-11/MOP-1  in Montreal. He urged limiting warming to under 2?C compared with  pre-industrial levels. He said a future framework should address  issues such as access to clean technologies, justice and equity,  new financing, and adaptation. He argued that 'we cannot delude  ourselves that we can engage the US at this point,' and should  begin discussions immediately to ensure continuity between the  first and second commitment periods. He also urged India to take a  'fresh approach' and support a Montreal mandate.

Saleemul Huq, on behalf of Research and Independent Non- Governmental Organizations (RINGOs), supported a more robust  response to climate change, and strengthened action on mitigation  and adaptation. He said RINGOs are committed to this process and  contributing as it moves forward in the direction agreed by  Parties.

# SESSION SEVEN

On Tuesday afternoon, delegates heard presentations from  representatives of Peru, Mali and Saudi Arabia, and engaged in a  question-and-answer session.

## PRESENTATIONS

### Peru:

María Paz Cigarán focused on practical action  to address climate change at the national level. She elaborated on  public awareness campaigns and adaptation issues, noting that  adaptation is local but needs international support. She  underscored the need to identify critical actors and target  audiences for public awareness campaigns, noting their campaign  slogan: 'Climate is changing, so should we.' Mali: Mama Konate elaborated on Mali's national monitoring plans  and meteorological information systems to provide weather  information to farmers, which are an example of local adaptation  and allow rural population to take action.

###     Saudi Arabia

Fareed Al-Asaly said Annex I Parties are not  fulfilling their commitments under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol,  particularly in reducing emissions or providing assistance and  technology transfer. He underscored that international action  should be based on the articles of the UNFCCC, and stating that  the Buenos Aires Programme on Adaptation was inadequate, he called  for a focus on modeling, insurance and economic diversification.

### DISCUSSION

Namibia, Burkina Faso, Togo and others expressed  interest in Mali's experiences with national monitoring plans and  meteorological information systems, and raised the idea of turning  them into a regional programme. Egypt and Malaysia stressed the  importance of technology transfer and the role of the private  sector in technology transfer. The Russian Federation highlighted  the need for better forecasts on the consequences of climate  change, together with historical and long-term perspectives.

Responding to a question from France about adaptation, María Paz  Cigarán said it is very difficult to generalize about the  experiences of different countries because of their diverse  circumstances. She indicated that, at present, focusing on  capacity building against climate variability would be the most  beneficial action, along with dissemination of information. Mama  Konate said Mali's information system is an example that can be  applied to any developing country. Fareed Al-Asaly said that, at  present, the development of cleaner fossil fuel technologies tends  to focus on coal, whereas Saudi Arabia would like to see similar  efforts put into oil technologies. Responding to Nigeria, the UK,  Algeria and Hungary on economic diversification, Fareed Al-Asaly  said Saudi Arabia is focusing its economic diversification efforts  on the petrochemical sector, while in terms of adaptation, the  emphasis is on coastal zone management.

# CLOSING SESSION

Co-Chair Chow Kok Kee opened the closing session late Tuesday  afternoon. Observing that the Seminar had produced some very  fruitful discussions, he asked experts to present their views on  three key issues: technology transfer, adaptation and mitigation.

Reflecting on the Seminar, several participants were positive  about the open, frank discussions that had taken place.  Luxembourg, on behalf of the EU, identified a 'large consensus'  among delegations on the common challenges ahead. He noted the  EU's determination to reinvigorate discussions on the post-2012  period and looked forward to further steps in Montreal at  COP-11/MOP-1.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

On technology transfer, participants  commented on how to increase the flow of technology transfer and  improve the effectiveness of the Kyoto Mechanisms. Canada  supported strategies targeted at specific technologies. The US  noted the framework agreed under the Marrakesh Accords. He  questioned calls for new mechanisms, and praised the Expert Group  on Technology Transfer on its work to date. He also highlighted  the focus on public-private partnerships. Tuvalu suggested a new  funding mechanism to support technology transfer.

On the CDM, Botswana said procedures needed to be simplified.  China highlighted difficulties with the CDM, and suggested  strengthening it and considering additional options. Nigeria  highlighted the CDM's role in catalyzing technology transfer,  supported strengthening the CDM, and stressed the importance of  technology needs assessments. Canada offered to host an informal  workshop on the CDM prior to COP-11/MOP-1, possibly in September  2005. Germany said the CDM should be strengthened without  renegotiating the Marrakesh Accords. Qatar emphasized a strong  compliance system with financial penalties as a means to ensure an  active CDM market. Uganda said the renegotiation of CDM modalities  would be too slow, and drew attention to problems caused by the  commercially-driven nature of technology transfer.

Calling for a signal to the market on post-2012 commitments,  Bulgaria highlighted the success of JI and described the Green  Investment Scheme, suggesting that Parties develop guidelines for  this new mechanism if necessary. Algeria lamented the complexity  of the CDM procedure. Indonesia said stricter emissions targets  for industrialized countries would speed up technology transfer by  reducing the cost of climate-friendly technologies, and emphasized  that the sustainability of lifestyles was more important than  technology. On the CDM, Indonesia said ways should be found to  make transport projects and projects that specifically reduce  carbon dioxide emissions more attractive. Kenya suggested measures  to encourage manufacturing in developing countries, and called for  changes to the CDM to ensure the equitable distribution of  projects. Bangladesh noted that allowing the market to drive CDM  investment concentrates projects in countries with better  infrastructure, and called for a mechanism to guarantee wider  distribution of CDM projects.

### ADAPTATION

Participants were then asked to discuss adaptation  issues. Finland underscored that mitigation is the key to tackling  climate change, but said adaptation is also required. She stressed  that adaptation and mitigation are complementary, not alternative  actions, and that the international approach to adaptation should  be different to that on mitigation.

###     India

emphasized that adaptation measures should not attempt to  replicate mitigation models, such as incremental costs. Senegal  said technology transfer should be integrated into political  decision making, and stressed the need for information transfer  and scientific cooperation. Japan and Bangladesh emphasized the  need to enhance monitoring and assessment of climate impacts and  vulnerability. Bangladesh underscored the need to integrate  disaster management into adaptation strategies. Botswana stressed  the importance of public awareness on adaptation.

### MITIGATION

On mitigation, the Republic of Korea highlighted  common but differentiated responsibilities and noted that, given  the current global reliance on fossil fuels, it was time to look  at the nuclear energy option more positively. He also said  economic considerations should help guide discussions on the  post-2012 period.

Canada said the key question now was how to move forward in a way  that builds constructively on the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. She  noted similarities in the way many countries are addressing the  climate change problem, and felt that there was a great deal of  scope for pooling efforts across countries and sectors.

Luxembourg, on behalf of the EU, supported seeking synergies  between combating climate change and sustainable development  objectives, and said EU Heads of State had agreed to restrict  warming to within the 2?C threshold. The UK highlighted benefits  of taking both a long-term and short-term approach, noting that  its ambitious long-term goal had provided a context and incentive  for short-term action.

###     Saudi Arabia

said the UNFCCC has set out a clear approach on  mitigation and Parties should meet their obligations. India  highlighted the issue of how to shape development policies in ways  that produce co-benefits on climate change. He noted that  developing countries are already implementing extensive and  successful packages of measures on climate change.

### CLOSING REMARKS

Responding to questions about the outcome of the  Seminar, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter noted that  COP-10 had invited the Secretariat to make the proceedings of the  Seminar available. She indicated that a video webcast of the  proceedings is available online, and said a compilation of all the  presentations and discussions would be prepared  (http://unfccc.int/meetings/seminar/items/3410.php). This would be  descriptive and factual, but would contain no interpretation of  events.

Co-Chair Masaki Konishi indicated that the Seminar had produced a  'useful and constructive exchange of information on a wide range  of issues.' He said a lot of information had been exchanged, and  it should help make individual and collective efforts more  efficient, and create confidence among Parties. He thanked all  participants, and expressed the hope that the Seminar had helped  pave the way for COP-11/MOP-1. He expressed his gratitude to the  Secretariat, interpreters, and the German Government for hosting  the meeting, and everyone who had made it possible for the Seminar  to take place.

Co-Chair Chow Kok Kee noted the frank exchange of information, and  congratulated participants on their upbeat and positive approach.  He said he detected a common vision, adding that, although 'we may  take 100 different paths,' he hoped they would all end up  achieving the same goal of combating climate change on the road to  sustainable development. He declared the Seminar closed shortly  after 7:00 pm.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF THE SEMINAR

'This Seminar is the first of its kind in UNFCCC history. [But]  time will tell if it will be remembered as an historic event,'  observed UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter at the  opening of the Seminar of Governmental Experts on Monday morning,  16 May. Waller-Hunter's comments reflected the sentiments of the  participants as the meeting began. Many were unsure of exactly  what to expect from the Seminar. This uncertainty was due in large  part to the importance and sensitivity of the issues many  participants hoped to discuss.

The decision to hold the Seminar was taken at COP-10 in December  2004, following heated discussions on how to engage on some of the  broader issues facing the climate change process. Foremost among  these issues for some Parties was the future framework and  commitments to combat climate change in the post-2012 period.  Developing countries were sensitive to attempts to discuss  emissions targets for non-Annex I Parties, and there was also the  difficult question of how to include non-Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol in talks on subsequent commitments. In addition, there  was interest in other issues, such as the increasingly strong  evidence of climate change, differences of opinion over Kyoto's  future, and mitigation and adaptation. As a result of these  concerns and sensitivities, the terms of reference set for the  Seminar were left both broad and, in some countries' opinions,  quite vague.

# FRANK DIALOGUE AND THE 'COMFY ARMCHAIR THEORY'

Given the difficulties at COP-10 during the discussions on the  Seminar and its mandate, most participants seemed pleasantly  surprised by the positive atmosphere as the Seminar began. Several  participants felt that the relaxed setting played its part. The  Seminar's Co-Chairs, Japan's Masaki Konishi and Malaysia's Chow  Kok Kee, adopted a laid-back approach that seemed to put  participants at ease. In addition, many delegates commented on the  comfortable red armchairs placed on the stage for the government  experts. The podium was lowered to make it more on a level with  participants - again to lessen the formality of the occasion. Some  compared it to a 'television talk show' setting, while others  likened the use of 'comfy chairs' and the informal approach to a  'nice fireside chat.' Whether or not these organizational details were instrumental in  generating the positive atmosphere, the dialogue was certainly  open, frank and broad-ranging. There was a free exchange of  information on actions countries are taking on mitigation and  adaptation, and to support implementation of commitments under the  UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. There were also no objections when  speakers began discussing the post-2012 period and other  previously-sensitive issues.

In an unusual departure from previous climate change meetings,  participants appeared open to discussing not only what their  positions are, but also the concerns underlying these positions.  There was considerable discussion on national circumstances, and  many observers noted a desire to understand other Parties'  positions and preoccupations. One participant suggested that the  broad terms of reference for the meeting, and the fact that it was  not linked to any specific agenda item, had allowed speakers to  think and talk 'outside the box.'

# SUBSTANCE AND STYLE

As well as the 'user-friendly' organizational style, many  observers were also pleased with the substantive nature of the  discussions, noting the focus on issues rather than procedure.  Controversial issues were discussed openly. These included  free-flowing debates on technology transfer, the benefits and  shortcomings of the CDM, adaptation and mitigation, and even  nuclear energy.

Discussions about technology played an important role in the  Seminar. On technology transfer issues, developing nations  articulated a clear desire for a greater commitment on this issue  on the part of industrialized countries. Participants generally  saw the CDM as a positive and innovative contribution, but they  also recognized the need to review and streamline the procedures  and expand the mechanism's scope. They also focused attention on  the need to develop new technologies. Some observers detected a  greater willingness to engage on technology issues that the United  States and some other countries have focused on recently,  including carbon sequestration and 'clean' fossils fuels.

Many experts emphasized the financial aspects of addressing  climate change, especially the need to ensure that actions provide  economic opportunities and are cost-effective. Again, some felt  this reflected a desire to accommodate the perspectives of those  who had criticized Kyoto on economic grounds. Business and  industry's desire for long-term certainty was stressed repeatedly,  as were companies' concerns about their inability to plan properly  with the post-2012 framework still so unclear. There appeared to  be consensus that such uncertainty was bad for long-term  investment. Many Parties also stressed the increasing evidence  about the economic impacts of climate change, which several  participants felt contributed towards the more open dialogue at  the Seminar. In particular, recent meetings affirming the dangers  of allowing temperatures to rise more than 2?C above pre- industrial levels seemed to have strengthened many Parties'  conviction that urgent action is needed.

Another message from the Seminar was the long time-lag for  translating political decisions into effective policy. This view  seemed to inspire a greater openness to talking about the post- 2012 period. Some Parties clearly hoped for a 'Montreal Mandate'  from COP/MOP-1 that would lay out a roadmap for the post-2012  negotiation phase. Whether that road makes its way directly  through Kyoto territory, within the UNFCCC framework, or heads  down several different paths, was a question most Parties were  careful to avoid.

With COP/MOP-1 still six months away, the outcome and potential  for a 'Montreal Mandate' is far from clear. While there was  definitely a constructive dialogue at the Seminar, some observers  felt that there were few signs that the differences between  Parties had actually narrowed, and that these differences could  soon translate once more into heated discussions and intransigence  once formal negotiations resumed. On the other hand, few would  disagree that the Seminar built confidence and demonstrated a  willingness to understand other positions and circumstances, and  even begin the search for innovative ways to accommodate them. One  participant summed it up as 'just a small first step in a new  phase for the climate process,' but quickly added that, 'at least  the step was in the right direction.'
