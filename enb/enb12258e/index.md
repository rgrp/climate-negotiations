# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

### OPENING

COP-10 President González García urged delegates to  recall the magnitude of the climate change problem and to redouble  efforts to deliver outcomes expected from COP-10. He expressed  confidence that, guided by common but differentiated  responsibilities, ministers would take action in the global effort  to combat climate change.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter highlighted  achievements of the UNFCCC since its entry into force in 1994. She  noted that despite efforts, CO2 concentrations are rising at an  increasing rate and climate change impacts are already evident.  She emphasized the need for planning the next steps.

Klaus Töpfer, on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, urged  delegates to look beyond 2012 and address the longer-term  challenge to promote low-carbon energy sources, low  greenhouse-gas-emitting technologies and renewable energy. He  emphasized that without mitigation, adaptation will become an  insurmountable task.

Néstor Kirchner, President of Argentina, said climate change will  increase poverty, noting that the poorest and most vulnerable  countries have done the least to cause climate change, but are the  ones that suffer most. He stressed that while developing countries  bear the cost of foreign debt, rich countries fail to meet  commitments on climate change and pay off their 'environmental  debt.' He also said developing countries have the right to moral  persuasion, and that as emissions increase in developed countries,  citizens in developing countries often struggle to survive.

### STATEMENTS FROM UN BODIES AND SPECIALIZED AGENCIES

Michel  Jarraud, WMO Secretary-General, outlined his organization's  contributions to climate change processes, underlining the value  of climate observation, monitoring and early warning activities.

Noting the 2005 review of progress of the implementation of the  Millennium Declaration, Klaus Töpfer, UNEP Executive Director,  stressed the impacts of climate change on vulnerable countries and  described UNEP's role in promoting sustainable development and  changing consumption and production patterns.

Rajendra Pachauri, IPCC Chair, stated that the Synthesis Report of  the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) will be available in  October 2007, and suggested that COP-13 be moved back three to  four weeks to allow Parties to have time to review the AR4.

Zépherin Diabré, UNDP Associate Administrator, emphasized that  entry into force of the Protocol is a key first step on the path  to a lower greenhouse gas-intensive society. He noted that  achievement of the Millennium Development Goals is not possible  unless climate-related risks are significantly managed and  reduced.

Noting that hundreds of millions of people suffer from hunger,  David Harcharik, FAO Deputy Director-General, drew attention to  the impact of climate change on global food security. He called on  the international community to drastically increase efforts to  reduce emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation, and  underscored the need to help vulnerable societies cope.

Leonard Good, CEO and Chair of the GEF, commended the UNFCCC for  its achievements, and underscored the need to address adaptation.  He drew attention to the GEF's climate-related work, and noted  that negotiations for the GEF's replenishment will begin in 2005.

Ian Johnson, Work Bank Vice-President, said human-induced climate  change will undermine long-term economic prospects and the ability  of the poor to escape poverty. He raised the need to limit  emissions from major greenhouse gas emitters in both developing  and developed countries in an equitable manner, and stressed the  importance of adaptation.

Marcel Boisard, UN Institute for Training and Research Executive  Director, called for urgent measures to respond to  capacity-building needs, especially for LDCs.

Grégoire de Kalbermatten, UN Convention to Combat Desertification  (UNCCD) Deputy Executive Secretary, said efforts to strengthen  synergies between the UNCCD, UNFCCC and Convention on Biological  Diversity include joint work programmes, consultative fora, and  country-level synergy workshops to implement the three Conventions.

### STATEMENTS FROM REGIONAL GROUPS

The REPUBLIC OF KOREA, for the  Environmental Integrity Group, urged developing and developed  countries to make efforts within their own capabilities and  explore new and flexible mechanisms to address climate change.

EL SALVADOR, for Central American countries, highlighted the  vulnerability of her region, noting that it has recently suffered  severe weather events. She said ecological and social fragility  constitutes a challenge to sustainable development and hoped that  funding will be available for adaptation to climate change,  poverty eradication and sustainable development.

TANZANIA, for LDCs, said that LDCs still need to resolve  outstanding issues on funding for the implementation of national  adaptation programmes of action.

KENYA, for the Africa Group, highlighted the urgency of adaptation,  and emphasized the need to operationalize the Special Climate  Change Fund.

The NETHERLANDS, for the EU, said the last decade and the entry  into force of the Protocol have provided the foundations for  increased international action on climate change. He explained  that the EU will soon start its own emissions trading scheme and  urged non-ratifying developed countries to make comparable  mitigation efforts during the first commitment period.

### PANEL 1 - 'THE UNFCCC AFTER 10 YEARS

ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND FUTURE  CHALLENGES:' The high-level panel discussion was moderated by  Sonia Tschorne Berestesky, Minister of Housing and Urban  Development, Chile. Following presentations by panelists, the  floor was opened to comments by Parties.

###     Panel statements

Jiang Liu, Vice-Minister of the State  Development and Reform Commission, China, said COP-10 provides the  opportunity for a shift from negotiations and rule-making to  implementation and concrete action. He said sustainable  development requires progress on both mitigation and adaptation,  and innovative strategies for technology transfer. He stressed  that negotiations should be guided by the principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities.

A. Raja, Minister of Environment and Forests, India, expressed  concern regarding growth in developed countries' emissions and  said greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries will grow if  they are to achieve sustainable development and poverty  eradication. He also emphasized that proposals for future actions  should not include new categories of Parties in the UNFCCC.

Yuriko Koike, Minister of Environment, Japan, said Japan is  undertaking a review of its climate change policy programme. She  stressed that additional policies and measures in the energy  sector are required to meet Japan's reduction targets, while  maintaining economic growth. Koike noted that Japan has undertaken  seminars on future climate issues in the Asia-Pacific region.

Martin Puta Tofinga, Minister of Environment, Soil and  Agriculture, Kiribati, noted that SIDS are some of the most  vulnerable countries to the impacts of climate change and urged  Parties that have not yet ratified the Protocol to do so. He  supported an open and frank dialogue on ways forward, drawing on  inputs from civil society.

Alexander Bedritzky, Chief of Hydrometeorology and Environment,  the Russian Federation, said Parties face many challenges,  including how to effectively measure the implementation of  quantitative reductions of greenhouse gas emissions, noting that a  five-year period is too short to monitor emissions trends.  Bedritzky supported voluntary commitments and stressed the need  for collective action to address the challenge of climate change.

Stating that climate change is the world's most serious threat,  Pieter van Geel, State Secretary for Housing, Spatial Planning and  the Environment, the Netherlands, called for limiting global  temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels,  and emphasized that this goal should guide future international  efforts. Noting that postponing action will make adaptation more  difficult, he called on countries to start considering future  commitments.

Paula Dobriansky, Under Secretary for Global Affairs, US,  underscored her country's commitment to the UNFCCC and highlighted  efforts to combat climate change, including through multilateral  scientific and technological initiatives. She stressed that  economic growth and environmental protection should go hand-in-hand.

###     Discussion

QATAR said the pressing needs of developing countries  should be met through full implementation of commitments by Annex  I Parties, including on capacity building, technology transfer and  financial support. GERMANY emphasized that to prevent an increase  in temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius, emissions must be  halved by 2050, and a binding medium-term goal to reduce emissions  by 2020 should be discussed. He urged the US to reduce its  emissions to 1990 levels according to its UNFCCC commitment and  said the decoupling of GDP and greenhouse-gas emissions growth in  developing countries must be achieved. Noting that the future of  the planet is at stake, LUXEMBOURG stressed the urgent need to  halt the growth of global emissions within two decades. BRAZIL  supported discussing future actions and a negotiating mandate for  2012, while respecting the historical responsibilities of  developed and developing countries. IRELAND, FRANCE, SWEDEN and  MICRONESIA supported a prompt, comprehensive and open dialogue on  the future of the climate change process. Announcing that his  country will soon ratify the Protocol, PAKISTAN recommended  engaging non-Parties and maintaining a regime architecture that is  sufficiently flexible and open to allow late entrants. CANADA  stressed the importance of multilateral action.

BENIN emphasized the importance of sustainable development,  poverty alleviation and adaptation for LDCs. The PHILIPPINES urged  timely and consistent delivery of resources, enhanced systems of  technology transfer and capacity building. SWEDEN said targets and  timetables are important and can go hand-in-hand with economic  growth. NEPAL sought to accelerate economic development with  energy efficiency and hoped to attract investment for clean  development. BANGLADESH urged developed countries to take action  to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and support those who are  vulnerable to sea-level rise. BELGIUM expressed concern about the  rate of climate change and drew attention to the social and  economic consequences that will result if urgent collective action  is not taken.

BARBADOS requested delegates to be mindful of UNFCCC Article 4.8  (adverse effects), and provide support to SIDS. MICRONESIA  emphasized that the urgent adaptation needs of SIDS should not be  'mixed-up' with those of oil-producing countries. TRINIDAD AND  TOBAGO, with the DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, noted increased hurricane  intensity. NAMIBIA said recurrent drought and desertification make  his country vulnerable to climate change, and urged all UNFCCC  Parties to comply with their obligations.

# COP CONTACT GROUP

### EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON UNFCCC ACTIVITIES RELEVANT TO OTHER  INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This contact group was chaired by José  Romero (Switzerland). Delegates discussed possible input to the  relevant intergovernmental processes. The US, opposed by AOSIS,  said conclusions should only state that an exchange of views  occurred and, with SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA, said reporting by the  Secretariat must only be on activities on which there is consensus  among the Parties. The EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, said: COP-11  should be updated on the outcomes of the events in question; the  COP should be noted as a resource body for the Commission on  Sustainable Development discussions on energy and climate change;  and that the conclusions should refer to a miscellaneous document  reflecting the EU's intervention in Plenary. AOSIS, supported by  the EU, and opposed by the US, JAPAN and SAUDI ARABIA, proposed  draft text that includes views of Parties given in Plenary. The  US, SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA cautioned against negotiating the  outcomes of processes before they begin.

Following a break, delegates reconvened to consider new text  drafted by Chair Romero. AOSIS expressed disappointment that none  of the views expressed in his group's submission were reflected in  the new draft text. SAUDI ARABIA said he could only accept text  that states that an exchange of views was held on UNFCCC  activities relevant to other intergovernmental meetings and that  requests the Secretariat to report on these activities. Chair  Romero said new text will be drafted and discussed.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Although the negotiations at COP-10 have struggled to come up with  provisions on future commitments, high-level statements demonstrate  that governments are indeed reflecting seriously about the next  commitment period and future actions. Observers remarked that,  while the day seemed quiet, a highly charged 'Friends of the  President' group was milling over the bracketed draft decisions in  a sheltered room upstairs in La Rural. This group is also  discussing the contested seminars on future actions, and are  expected to come with a 'package' deal to the COP on Friday.
