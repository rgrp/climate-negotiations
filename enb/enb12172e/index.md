# PRESIDENT'S GROUP

### SATURDAY - FIRST MEETING

In a mid-afternoon meeting of the  President's Group - a single, main plenary of Ministers and other  senior officials - President Pronk updated participants on  progress in consultations held earlier Saturday on the issues of  finance, mechanisms, LULUCF and compliance.

Secretary of State Philippe Roch (Switzerland) reported on the  consultations on finance. He emphasized the diverse positions on  fundamental aspects of funding and reported  possible progress on  four elements: the necessity to clearly separate between the  implementation of the UNFCCC and the Protocol in order to allow  those Parties not wishing to ratify the Protocol to continue to  participate in mitigation work under the UNFCCC; the need for  additional funding for the implementation of the UNFCCC and the  Protocol; the need for funding to be predictable; and the need to  quantify the funding. He explained that this last element  constituted the weakest result of his consultations.

Minister Peter Hodgson (New Zealand) reported on his consultations  on the mechanisms. He said that although no explicit agreement had  been reached, progress on some matters had been made, in  particular with the introduction of new text that 'might fly.' On  supplementarity, he said the EU had 'moved big distances.' He  reported that he had suggested text that: includes a reference to  'significant' as an elaboration of the term 'supplemental';  requests Annex I Parties to provide relevant information in  relation to such domestic action; and provides that the  facilitative branch of the Compliance Committee address questions  of implementation on this issue. On nuclear, he suggested an  addition to the language in the Pronk text giving an assessment  role to the host country in terms of the sustainability of the  project. On the Supervisory Committee, Minister Hodgson said the  'ball is in the court' of the Russian Federation and Ukraine.

On LULUCF, Ambassador Raul Estrada (Argentina) said consultations  had focused on individual and collective caps. He emphasized that  the principal problem was the 'Big Absent' of the negotiations,  and that efforts had been made to protect this 'absent' country's  interests to facilitate its joining the Protocol at a later stage.

Minister Valli Moosa (South Africa) reported on the consultations  on compliance. He said that given the legally binding nature of  the Protocol, its compliance mechanism must go well beyond a mere  'gentlemen's agreement.' He suggested a stepped approach for the  compliance system with an emphasis on facilitation. The first step  would be an early warning system through the review teams setting  a process of facilitation to assist Parties in cases where there  might be non-compliance. During the compliance period itself,  legally binding consequences would need to ensure 'environmental  restoration' rather than punish the Party concerned. He also  indicated the need for certainty for market mechanisms.

President Pronk then reported on his consultations on technology  transfer. He said the name of the body had been agreed upon and  that there was 'flexibility in the air' with regard to its  composition. On adverse effects of policies and measures, he  suggested, inter alia, a move towards a 'global cost-effective'  approach to minimize costs for all countries. He concluded the  session by saying that, following the request from the G-77/China  and other Parties, he would prepare a proposal to be tabled later  that day.

### SATURDAY - SECOND MEETING

Late evening Saturday, President Pronk  reported again to the Group, observing 'increasing consensus'  following high-level substantive discussions held Friday and  Saturday. He then presented a proposal for a draft decision  outlining political agreements on core elements of the BAPA.

Pronk's 'core elements' proposal: Notable features of the proposal  include enforcement consequences aimed at restoring non-compliance  and repairing the damage to the environment in cases of non- compliance. On LULUCF, the text proposes including activities  under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities) during the  first commitment period, with individual Party caps on credits  from forest management. On finance, a political declaration  'inviting' funding from Annex II Parties. Key proposals on the  mechanisms include: afforestation and reforestation projects in  the CDM during the first commitment period; Annex I Parties  refraining from using nuclear in the CDM and JI; domestic action  constituting a 'significant element' of Annex I Parties' efforts  to meet commitments; and a provision on financial additionality.  The proposal is available online at:  http://www.unfccc.int/COP- 6_2/index.html President Pronk expressed the hope that delegates would be able to  agree on his text on Sunday. Towards this end, he said he would  conduct bilateral consultations with the different  political/regional groups throughout the night and until early  afternoon Sunday.

### SUNDAY MEETING

In a briefing to the Group held at 5:00 pm Sunday,  President Pronk stated that, in spite of numerous expressions of  concern, the EU, the Transcaucasian Group, CG-11, and the  Environmental Integrity Group had expressed their willingness to  accept the proposal as it stands, provisional on other countries  not demanding amendments.

President Pronk noted that several members of the Umbrella Group  had expressed concerns, particularly on finance-related issues and  compliance. Three members of the group had indicated that they  could compromise and agree to the text. However, other members of  the Umbrella Group wanted to 'further improve' the text. The G-77/China had indicated that it was not yet willing to accept the  text.

President Pronk noted that discussions were taking place between  the EU and the G-77/China on a possible declaration on funding. He  concluded by saying he would continue to consult with delegates,  including separately with individual Umbrella Group members. He  hoped to come forward with a specific proposal aimed at securing a  deal by Sunday evening.

### MONDAY MEETING

At 12:30 am Monday, 23 July, President Pronk  reconvened the Group. He reported that he had not produced a new  text because he believed an agreement remained possible on his  'core elements' proposal. He said that although ongoing  consultations had managed to address some Parties' concerns, not  all problems had been cleared up. Suggesting that Groups'  overriding remaining concerns related to the compliance section,  he said further consultations would be held on that section only.  He suggested that if delegates could not reach agreement, he would  bring the text back for adoption in Plenary as it stood.

# PLENARY

At 11:55 am Monday, 23 July, delegates reconvened in a Plenary  session of the COP. President Pronk reported that intense  negotiations had been undertaken throughout the night on the  section on compliance, and had concluded around 10:00 am.

He introduced the draft decision resulting from negotiations,  which is contained in two informal papers entitled 'core elements  for the implementation of the BAPA.' The first, dated 21 July, was  distributed Saturday night (see Pronk's 'core elements' proposal  on page one). The second, dated 23 July, contains the revised text  on compliance. The compliance text was amended in three key areas:  consequences to be applied by the enforcement branch shall aim at  ensuring 'environmental integrity' rather than 'reparation of  damage to the environment'; the stipulation that payments be made  to 'repair damage to the environment' is deleted; and COP-6 adopts  the compliance regime and recommends to COP/MOP-1 the adoption, in  terms of Article 18 (compliance), of procedures and mechanisms  relating to compliance.

Commenting on the draft decision, President Pronk noted that some  legal and technical points will also have to be cleared up in the  text. He then proposed that the COP approve the draft decision on  the understanding that the formal adoption will follow at its next  Plenary meeting when the text has been issued as an official  conference paper. The COP adopted the decision, with a standing  ovation.

Thanking all delegates and staff for their cooperative spirit and  devotion to reach a result, President Pronk said this result was  necessary not just for the climate but to underline the value of  multilateral negotiations within the framework of the UN.

UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar thanked  President Pronk, all the Parties, the UNFCCC Secretariat and his  colleagues from the wider UN family, for giving him 'such a bright  and hopeful moment.' In general statements, many Parties expressed satisfaction at the  adoption of the decision. IRAN, for the G-77/CHINA, said this was  an 'honorable deal' that represents a historic achievement and  'the triumph of multilateral negotiations over unilateralism.' The EU said the agreement was historic and, with the ENVIRONMENTAL  INTEGRITY GROUP, stressed that it was very positive for the  international community. He said the door had been left open for a  country that considers that the Protocol is not the best tool to  address climate change, to join at a later stage. He then read the  text of a Political Declaration submitted by the EU, Canada,  Iceland, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland on funding to  developing countries, which includes an engagement to provide an  annual contribution of US$ 410 million by 2005.

AUSTRALIA said the Umbrella Group would meet its responsibilities.  CANADA announced that it would allocate ten million dollars to  jump-start the fund to help meet the adaptation needs of LDCs.  CHINA thanked the EU and others for their Political Declaration  and said the agreement had demonstrated that, in times of crisis,  the international community continues to move in the right  direction. JAPAN expressed pleasure in joining the consensus that  constitutes a vital step towards realizing the entry into force of  the Protocol by 2002. She added that a global effort is needed to  achieve the Protocol's objectives. CG-11 said individual members  promised to do their best to engage the Protocol ratification  process and hoped the 'skeptical' country would join the global  endeavor.

The US noted that the COP recognizes a segregation between funding  under the UNFCCC and the Protocol. She added that the fact that  the US did not seek to block consensus did not change her  country's view that the Protocol is 'not sound policy.' The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION said that although his country is not currently  able to join in financial assistance to developing countries, he  thinks it will be able to do so sometime in the future. SAUDI  ARABIA said that, in spite of some concerns, it had agreed to join  the consensus. The meeting closed at 2:05 pm.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

A profound sense of relief swept the corridors late Monday morning  as it finally emerged that Ministers and other high-level  officials had achieved a result in Bonn on key political issues  after 'marathon' talks. While many bleary-eyed observers were  noting that this text involved many compromises, especially on the  part of the EU and the G-77/China, most seemed elated that an  agreement had been reached, even if the general perception was  that it was not as strong as it could have been. Some participants  noted that, with the US no longer in the Protocol picture, the  remaining Umbrella Group members had 'held all the cards' coming  into these talks, meaning that a result generally favoring their  positions on key issues such as sinks, compliance and funding was  always likely if a deal was to be struck at all. Several  participants also suggested that this outcome was a 'victory for  multilateralism.'
