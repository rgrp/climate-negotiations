# PLENARY

## PROGRESS REPORTS BY THE CHAIRS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BODIES

SBI Chair  Ashe said the SBI had considered all its agenda items and  completed consideration of a number of these. He drew attention to  areas requiring further work, including: proposals to amend the  list in UNFCCC Annexes I and II; arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings; matters relating to LDCs; the CGE;   and possible options to respond to late payment of contributions.  He indicated that consultations on these matters are ongoing.

SBSTA Chair Dovland informed delegates that SBSTA was holding  informal consultations to prepare conclusions on several items. He  reported that no major problems had been encountered, and hoped  that work on outstanding items would be completed soon.

## PROGRESS REPORTS BY THE CHAIRS OF THE NEGOTIATING GROUPS

###  Mechanisms:

Co-Chair Estrada reported that two drafting groups had  been formed, with one working on the CDM, and the other focusing  on JI and emissions trading. He noted satisfactory progress,  particularly in Thursday's meeting on Article 6 (JI). Describing  Article 7.4 (assigned amounts) as a key article containing  definitions of a number of aspects of the mechanisms, he noted  that the G-77/China has now defined its position, and said he  expected forward movement on this issue.

CANADA, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, expressed concern with the manner  in which the issue of linkages between compliance and eligibility  to participate in the mechanisms was dealt with in the mechanisms  contact group Thursday evening. He said several Parties did not  agree with the Co-Chairs' formulation on this issue, and expressed  concern that these objections had been overruled. He requested  that the text remain bracketed as in the COP-6 Part II report  (FCCC/CP/2001/5/Add.2, page 24 paragraph 18b). JAPAN supported  Canada's statement and expressed 'alarm' at how this issue had  been addressed.

Co-Chair Estrada responded that the text used by the Co-Chairs was  taken directly from the Bonn Agreements (FCCC/CP/2001/5, page 43,  paragraph 11), and said the ministers' decision should be  maintained. CANADA highlighted inconsistencies in the Bonn  Agreements described by COP-6 President Pronk as a 'clash' between  the purpose of text on the mechanisms and the text on compliance.  This inconsistency resulted in the Secretariat preparing a draft  text on the mechanisms outlining three options, and that the  negotiating group Co-Chairs had selected one of these. However, he  noted that Canada, Japan and others had opposed this option and  had asked the Co-Chairs for their preference to be considered at  COP-7.

President Elyazghi said he would meet with negotiating group  chairs, and highlighted the treatment of registers and assigned  amounts as issues requiring further consideration.

###     Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8:

Chair Dovland reported that this  group had engaged in an initial discussion on almost all  outstanding issues, making some progress on a limited number of  them. He indicated that two drafting groups had been formed to  address the most difficult issues. One drafting group had taken up  the matter of LULUCF reporting requirements, with much work  remaining, including the question of how principles in the  draft  COP decision on LULUCF are addressed in reporting guidelines. The  other drafting group had been tackling outstanding matters  relating to expert review teams, Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse  effects), and how Protocol Article 4 (regional integration  organization) should be included. Chair Dovland stated that  flexibility will be needed to ensure that the text forwarded to  ministers does not contain too many unresolved issues.

The EU noted the need for urgency in negotiations, while calling  for care and consistency in addressing technical issues. The CG-11  urged Parties not to reopen or reinterpret the Bonn Agreements.

###     Compliance:

Co-Chair Slade reported on consultations on the draft  compliance text in a drafting group and in smaller groups, noting  that agreements had been confirmed or reconfirmed on a number of  issues, but that a range of key issues remained unresolved, with  some awaiting results of work in other groups.

## WORLD SUMMIT ON SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

On consideration of input  to the WSSD, Parties stressed the principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities, the importance of the three  'pillars' of sustainable development, linkages between the UNFCCC,  CCD and CBD, and the opportunity the WSSD offers to consider  progress made since UNCED in 1992. A paper containing discussion  elements for the COP contribution to the WSSD was distributed  later on Friday.

## OTHER MATTERS

On other matters, Parties adopted the draft  decision on the letter from the Central Asia, Caucasus, Albania  and Moldova countries on their status under the UNFCCC. The  decision invites SBSTA to consider the request at its sixteenth  session.

# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### MECHANISMS

The negotiating group met in afternoon and evening  sessions to consider the Annex on modalities and procedures for a  CDM contained in the Co-Chairs' non-paper on work in progress in  the negotiating group on mechanisms, distributed Thursday.  Agreement was reached on a number of paragraphs, while several  issues were referred to ministers.

On the role of the Executive Board in approving new methodologies  and guidelines related to baselines, monitoring plans and project  boundaries, CHINA, supported by BRAZIL and SAUDI ARABIA, proposed  additional text suggesting the Board should review rather than  approve new methodologies and guidelines, and should recommend  these to the COP/MOP for approval. NORWAY, the EU and JAPAN  disagreed. AUSTRALIA, supported by SAMOA, proposed a compromise  text whereby the Executive Board would review and could make  recommendations to the COP/MOP if it considered it necessary. In  addition, the EU, opposed by CANADA and SAMOA, proposed the  insertion of additionality to be considered under methodologies  and guidelines. These matters were referred to ministers.

On issues relating to costs of participation of members in the  Executive Board, SLOVENIA proposed reference to economies in  transition in the draft text. The group agreed to a Co-Chairs'  compromise referring to 'other Parties eligible under UNFCCC  practice.' On the composition of the Executive Board, delegates  agreed to additional text proposed by SAMOA whereby the COP/MOP  will elect an alternate for each member of the Board. On the  procedure for appointing a member to replace another member who  has resigned or is unable to attend, the text was amended to  specify that the member appointed would be from the same  constituency. Suspending the meeting, Co-Chair Chow informed  delegates that President Elyazghi had set a deadline of 7:00 pm  Saturday for the negotiating group to complete its work.

During an evening session, delegates continued consideration of  the Executive Board. The paragraphs on quorum and decision making  were referred to ministers. On attendance of the meetings,  delegates agreed to a proposal by SAMOA opening attendance to  stakeholders. All the paragraphs in the section on accreditation  and designation of operational entities were agreed, with minor  drafting amendments.

In the section on designated operational entities, JAPAN,  supported by several Parties, proposed adding references to  'enhancements by sinks' in order to reflect the acceptance of  afforestation and reforestation under the CDM in the Bonn  Agreements. The EU, NEW ZEALAND, BRAZIL, INDIA and CHINA opposed  this addition. They supported a discussion on the issue within the  context of the draft COP decision, as proposed by Co-Chair  Estrada, that elaborates on the eligibility of LULUCF activities  in the first and future commitment periods as well as on the work  to be undertaken by SBSTA. Delegates agreed to adopt the section  as is, with the understanding that adjustments might need to be  made, depending on the outcome of the discussion on the draft  decision.

Delegates then considered Article 7.4 (assigned amounts). Position  papers on this issue were introduced by the Umbrella Group, EU and  G-77/China, and Parties agreed that the Co-Chairs would prepare a  consolidated text incorporating these papers for consideration  Saturday morning. Parties reconvened again at 10:00 pm to continue  work on the remaining mechanisms-related issues.

# INFORMAL GROUPS AND CONSULTATIONS

### CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

The informal group on the CDM Executive Board  met in an evening session to consider outstanding issues relating  to the nomination of the Board.

### COMPLIANCE

The compliance drafting group met in an afternoon  session to consider the section on consequences of the Co-Chairs'  non-paper on outstanding issues and to discuss a new proposal from  CANADA, JAPAN, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION and AUSTRALIA for the draft  COP decision. Limited progress was reported on these issues. JAPAN  also submitted a proposal outlining options setting limits on the  possibility of a Party-to-Party trigger. The group also met in the  evening in an attempt to resolve all outstanding issues,  continuing its work late into the night.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The drafting group on elements  related to LULUCF under the Articles 5, 7 and 8 guidelines met in  the afternoon, with some progress reported. The meeting was  suspended in the evening to allow regional groups to consult  following disagreements regarding whether failure to report on  LULUCF should trigger non-compliance.

### CGE

The informal group on CGE met in the afternoon to continue  discussion on the terms of reference, and begin considering the  draft decision on the revision of guidelines for the preparation  of non-Annex I communications. While several Parties supported the  extension of the current terms of reference, there was no  agreement on this issue. Text referring to LDCs was also left  bracketed, as no outcome had been reached during the LDC  consultations held Thursday. On the terms of reference,  participants discussed: the cut-off time for reviewing national  communications and for inclusion in the Secretariat's compilation  and synthesis report; the number of workshops to be held during  the next period; and the number of experts to be invited to these  workshops. On the revision of guidelines, the US did not support  deciding at COP-7 on the frequency of submission of national  communications by non-LDC developing country Parties. Delegates  agreed to continue their work in a drafting group.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

'Fatigue' and 'deadline' were the words on delegates' lips Friday.  Observers noted that many negotiators were looking decidedly less  fresh and energized following several long days of talks and  running from one meeting to the next, with several participants  openly hoping that Sunday would be a rest day before COP-7's final  week and the high-level segment. The Saturday evening deadline  announced by COP-7 President Elyazghi on Friday was generally well  received, with some delegates seemingly pleased that a time had  been set for completion of work, although several seemed to think  that it might be overly optimistic.

In other news, the long-awaited meeting on accounting for assigned  amounts under Article 7.4 finally took place Friday night. While  some expressed frustration that the meeting was suspended  following the submissions of new proposals from Parties, others  felt the consolidation of these proposals by the Co-Chairs  overnight would help considerably in further talks scheduled for  Saturday.
