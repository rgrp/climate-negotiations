# NEGOTIATING GROUPS

### MECHANISMS

The mechanisms group met in the morning and afternoon  to identify and discuss the unresolved technical and political  issues. Co-Chair Estrada raised the possibility that finalizing  agreement on the appendices (relating to various 'administrative'  elements for implementation of the mechanisms) could be left for  negotiation at COP-7. A number of developing and developed  countries opposed this, emphasizing the importance of the  appendices for issues such as a prompt start of the CDM.

Co-Chair Estrada identified six 'technical issues' that should be  resolved by the negotiating group: environmental impact  assessments; public participation; baselines; small-scale projects  in the CDM; certified emissions reduction (CER) transactions; and  mechanisms' eligibility and the verification procedures that may  be used in terms of track two of joint implementation (JI)  projects. Informal groups were established to address these  issues. Their findings will be reflected in the Co-Chairs' report  to be presented to Plenary on Thursday.

Co-Chair Estrada identified a non-exhaustive list of ten  'political issues' for resolution by Ministers: equity;  supplementarity; nuclear in the CDM and JI; establishment and  composition of a supervisory committee for verification of CERs;  composition of the CDM Executive Board; level of the commitment  period reserve; application of share of proceeds to all three  mechanisms; the requirement that Annex I Parties' use of CERs be  conditional on it being party to the compliance Agreement;  unilateral CDM; and sinks in the CDM. For each issue, he proposed  a short list of options that would be presented to Ministers,  based on The Hague and Pronk texts.

Delegates presented their views on the various options, with  diverging opinions being expressed, in particular on those  regarding: nuclear in the CDM and JI; the establishment and  composition of a supervisory committee; the level of the  commitment period reserve; and sinks in the CDM. On this last  issue, Co-Chair Estrada ruled against a request from a group of  Annex I countries that an option be included providing for all  sinks project types within the CDM.

In the afternoon, delegates considered the following political  issues identified by developing countries: the lack of parity  between Annex I Parties under Article 4 (joint fulfillment) and  other Parties; the need for special consideration for LDCs;  financial additionality; and the equitable distribution of CDM  projects on a geographical basis. Co-Chair Estrada proposed that  clear options be presented for Ministers on Article 4, and that  the remaining issues be addressed within the Co-Chairs' report to  the Plenary. He ruled against a request from certain developing  countries to include reference in the report to an equitable  distribution fund, but undertook to raise this issue orally in his  presentation to Plenary.

### COMPLIANCE

On Wednesday afternoon, delegates heard a report from  Chair Romero of the working group on consequences applied under  the enforcement branch and the related issue of the legal basis  for adoption. He said the group had identified and agreed on a  list of short and specific questions for the attention of  Ministers. Co-Chair Slade then submitted a Co-Chairs' Note, based  on a similar format, identifying questions on the outstanding  issues. He explained that the sections on consequences and legal  basis for adoption were mainly based on the outcome of the working  group.

On the enforcement branch consequences, a number of Parties  questioned the differences between the Note and the text agreed in  the working group. They suggested that the language agreed in the  latter be retained. On the legal basis for adoption, delegates  discussed whether the COP or the COP/MOP should adopt the  decision.

On membership, several Annex I Parties said the proposed questions  were drafted in a prejudicial manner, did not distinguish between  the two branches, and lacked a clear presentation of the different  available options. They said the first option presumed that the  composition of the Compliance Committee be based on UNFCCC  existing practice with regard to the bureau, and questioned the  precedent-setting nature of this rule in this context. On the  second proposed option, some Annex I Parties said membership  should be based on the functions and mandate of the branch, rather  than solely on the commitments of groups of Parties. A group of  developing countries responded that the proposed text constituted  a minimalist approach clearly giving the two guiding composition- options. Developing countries and a group of developed countries  suggested that voting rules of compliance bodies also be addressed  in the questionnaire.

On Principles, non-Annex I Parties and several Annex I Parties  proposed a question addressing whether Principles should expressly  be included in the text. One Annex I Party added a question asking  whether, rather than how, the principle of common but  differentiated responsibilities should be reflected in the  consequences of the facilitative branch. Several Annex I Parties  suggested that the wording 'and respective capabilities' be added.

On appeal, some Annex I Parties said the questions should be  presented in a clear, neutral manner and follow a staged approach.  They suggested that the first question ask whether there should be  an appeal.

The Co-Chairs undertook to amend their Note, based on these  comments and discussions held the previous day, and to present  issues and positions in a balanced and neutral manner. The revised  Note will be conveyed to Plenary and submitted under the  responsibility of the Co-Chairs.

### FINANCIAL ISSUES

This group met in morning and evening sessions.  In the morning, delegates considered the proposals on funding and  resource levels in Pronk's text, with many Parties expressing  reservations. Most Annex I Parties, opposed by developing  countries, supported voluntary rather than mandatory levels of  contribution, and opposed any compliance consequences/penalties.

One developed country added that levels of contributions should be  set for countries collectively, not individually, and did not  accept the formula for burden sharing, which calculates Annex I  Parties' financial contributions based on their share of carbon  dioxide emissions in 1990. Annex I Parties also preferred building  on existing institutions, with a focus on the GEF. These delegates  stressed that any new institutions must add value and not  duplicate the GEF's work or mandate.

One Annex I Party said the discussion on additional funding was  taking place because some Parties wished to move beyond the  UNFCCC. He said this should not involve Parties that do not intend  to ratify the Protocol. Another group of Annex I Parties said  implementation of both the UNFCCC and Protocol requires additional  funding, and insisted on the involvement of all Annex II Parties  in this regard.

Developing countries stressed the need to separate UNFCCC and  Protocol issues. They said President Pronk's adaptation fund  proposal is a Protocol issue. Emphasizing the polluter pays  principle, they said existing UNFCCC commitments have not been  fully implemented. They expressed reservations over the suggestion  of a climate resources committee. A group of countries with  economies in transition (EITs) opposed the text's proposals for  funding from EITs.

Parties then considered Pronk's text paragraph by paragraph. In  the preamble, several Annex I Parties called for deletion of 'new  and additional' funding. Several EITs proposed refering to Annex  II Parties rather than Annex I Parties. Co-Chair Ashe said a Co- Chairs' text outlining countries' positions and the various  options would be prepared for the Plenary.

The group on finance reconvened in the evening to discuss The  Hague text on impact of the implementation of response measures.  Co-Chair Tsering noted that with the anticipated completion of the  texts on Article 3.14 and LDCs, only matters related to financial  matters would be outstanding in the text on adverse effects. On  support for the development of energy sources, Parties discussed  at length a footnote referring to the Agenda 21 definition of  'environmentally sound.' Non-Annex I Parties, opposed by several  developed countries, supported keeping it. One developed country  said the term is normal usage in the UN system and the sensitive  nature of the issue meant it should be left without the footnote  in this text.

Delegates also met throughout the day in various informal groups,  making progress on texts on several relevant issues. Text on  UNFCCC Article 4.9 (LDCs) was discussed in a group facilitated by  Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso), while talks on Protocol Article  3.14 were chaired by Leon Charles (Grenada). Progress was made in  both groups, with some brackets being removed. The group on  Article 3.14 also considered certain paragraphs in the section on  impacts of the implementation of response measures.

The informal group on technology transfer agreed on the title  'Expert Group on Technology Transfer.' Outstanding unresolved  issues include the purpose and function of the group, its terms of  reference, and its composition. Co-Chair Ashe will prepare a non- paper on this issue to be made available Thursday.

### LULUCF

Delegates discussed Principles governing LULUCF  activities. It was noted that Principles suggested by the G-77/China and others, and appearing in The Hague text, had been  integrated into operative paragraphs of the Pronk text. Many  Parties argued that the Principles should be explicit and form a  preamble. It was decided that Ministers would be informed that the  Principles, as contained in The Hague text, have been widely  accepted and should guide their further work.

In a discussion on the accounting rules under Article 3.3  contained in Pronk's text, two Annex I Parties questioned the  absence of reference to the accounting anomaly related to short  rotation forests.

The EU presented its proposal on LULUCF activities, which aims at  reducing their overall scale by capping Article 3.4 activities and  the mechanisms respectively. The proposal does not allow LULUCF  activities in the CDM, on which several Parties expressed  reservations. Some Annex I Parties opposed using a discount rate  and capping the mechanisms, which they said already are 'heavily  constrained.' A group of EITs supported a practical compromise  based on a negotiated relative limit, representing a percentage of  base year emissions, to Article 3.4 activities. Parties then  briefly commented on the Co-Chairs' Summary from the negotiating  group to be presented to Plenary.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With the high-level ministerial meeting starting Thursday,  participants have been considering the likely strategies of the  key negotiating groups. While there was speculation that those  committed to a 'strong' Protocol would need to compromise heavily  to keep the treaty alive, some non-governmental participants  thought these Parties might take a different, tougher approach to  'preserve the Protocol's environmental integrity' and 'shame'  others into joining. However, even some veterans to the process  admitted uncertainty on what the most effective strategy might be.

Meanwhile, several observers were detecting further hardening of  positions among groups, pointing to the resurrection of issues  such as nuclear projects in the CDM, that many thought had been  resolved in The Hague. The more optimistic commentators dismissed  this as merely posturing aimed at creating greater 'negotiating  capital' prior to the high-level talks. Self-titled 'realists' are  suggesting some Parties may be holding off on 'playing their  cards' until COP-7.

Another topic of conversation was the extent to which the G8 talks  in Genoa might impact on the Bonn negotiations.
