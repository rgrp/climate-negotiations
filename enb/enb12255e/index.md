abstract: "On Saturday, COP-10 delegates convened throughout the day in  numerous contact groups, and met in an in-session workshop on the  organization of the intergovernmental process in the afternoon. A  COP contact group took up the report of the CDM Executive Board  (EB). SBSTA contact groups addressed: small-scale afforestation  and reforestation (A&R) project activities under the CDM; research  and systematic observation (R&SO); issues relating to registry  systems under Protocol Article 7.4; technology transfer; and good  practice guidance (GPG) for LULUCF activities, harvested wood  products (HWP) and other issues relating to LULUCF. In the evening,  an SBI contact group addressed submission of second and, where  appropriate, third national communications from non-Annex I  Parties. The afternoon in-session workshop on the organization of  the intergovernmental process addressed possible options for  improving the organization of future sessional periods, to enable  the UNFCCC process to maximize its efficiency and lead to more  effective outcomes."

# CONTACT GROUPS

### SMALL-SCALE A&R CDM

Co-Chair Thelma Krug reported progress on the  draft decision text and annex on modalities and procedures for  small-scale A&R CDM activities, and presented draft conclusions.  She outlined amendments to the new draft decision and conclusions  paragraph-by-paragraph, and said that Parties had informally  resolved, inter alia, outstanding issues of bundling, leakage, and  monitoring. Delegates agreed to forward these draft texts to SBSTA.

### R&SO

This contact group discussed a draft decision and draft  conclusions presented by the Co-Chairs. Delegates reached  consensus on the texts, and agreed to forward them to SBSTA.

### CDM EB

The contact group considered a draft decision text. INDIA  and others expressed the need for text on arbitration provisions  and on protection for EB members and others from liability. Chair  Raúl Estrada-Oyuela proposed text stating that the EB shall, where  it decides to limit attendance at its meetings, take all practicable  steps to accommodate non-Parties to the Protocol and others to  observe proceedings, except when the EB decides to close the  meeting or a portion of it. The US stressed the need for stronger  wording allowing for the physical presence of Protocol non-Parties  at meetings and that new text should replace Rule 27 of the EB  rules of procedure (attendance). BRAZIL, opposed by JAPAN, said EB  meetings should be closed, except on occasions where there are no  confidential decisions being taken. The group approved, inter alia,  preambular text on additionality and operative text on transparency.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLE 7.4

Chair Murray Ward presented a draft decision  on registry systems. Delegates discussed technical details  surrounding the role and tasks of the international transaction  log (ITL) administrator. The EU suggested adding text to stress  that the timely implementation and testing of registry systems is  required for the prompt start of the CDM. On the relationship  between the ITL and supplementary transaction logs (STLs), BRAZIL  said ITL rules should not be compromised by additional rules  relevant to the STLs. Expressing concern about the performance of  the ITL, CHINA proposed requesting the ITL administrator to  conduct testing and independent assessments on the performance of  the ITL, and called for the involvement of both Annex I and  non-Annex I Parties. Parties agreed to continue considerations  informally.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Following informal consultations, Co-Chairs  Holger Liptow and Kishan Kumarsingh presented revised draft  conclusions, which delegates discussed paragraph-by-paragraph.  Consensus was reached on all text except for one paragraph on  fossil-fuel technologies, as it addresses articles other than  UNFCCC Article 4.5 (technology transfer). SAUDI ARABIA proposed to  bracket the draft conclusions in their entirety until the  paragraph is addressed. The Co-Chairs noted that the paragraph had  been forwarded to COP President González García for consultations.  The Co-Chairs also introduced a draft decision based on text  presented by the G-77/China. The EU, AUSTRALIA, and other Parties  stated that the draft decision could not be discussed until  consensus on the draft conclusions is reached. The US said that  some Parties are holding the process 'hostage.' Informal  consultations on how to proceed will be held.

### LULUCF

Co-Chair Audun Rosland presented new draft conclusions on  GPG and other issues relating to LULUCF. AUSTRALIA, with the EU,  NEW ZEALAND, NORWAY, JAPAN and SWITZERLAND supported the text,  while AOSIS and other Parties expressed reservations on several  matters, including a proposed open-ended dialogue. Co-Chair  Rosland said the text is intended as a compromise between Parties.  On HWP, Parties are unresolved on how the IPCC should develop  methods to estimate, measure and report on HWP in the 2006 IPCC  Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Inventories. CANADA stated that the  IPCC should develop methodologies in a 'neutral' fashion in  relation to potential accounting approaches for HWP. AUSTRALIA  recommended that the IPCC's work on HWP should be consistent with  definitions under the UNFCCC. AOSIS said that Parties should avoid  presuming what the IPCC is intending to do in its work. Other  outstanding issues will be taken up by informal drafting groups.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The US and CANADA, opposed by  the G-77/CHINA, indicated willingness to accept a Co-Chairs' draft  text. The G-77/CHINA opposed the text, stating that, inter alia,  inclusion of text regarding greenhouse gas inventories and updates  of relevant information to national communications is outside the  mandate of the agenda item. He also opposed the submission of  second and, where appropriate, third national communications  within four years of the initial disbursement of financial  resources for the preparation of national communications.  Discussions on whether to forward this text or another one to  SBI-21 continued into the night.

# IN-SESSION WORKSHOP ON ORGANIZATION OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL  PROCESS

This in-session workshop was chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany).  Participants considered the content, timing and adoption of the  agendas of the COP, SBSTA and SBI, and the 'building blocks' of  the process, including COP and SB sessions, workshops and  constituted bodies. Panelists commented on the topics, followed by  discussion among participants.

### OPENING REMARKS

Noting that the entry into force of the Protocol  will generate additional work, SBI Chair Stoycheva said the  workshop provides a timely opportunity to exchange views informally  on how to improve the organization of the intergovernmental process.  UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter stressed that the  intergovernmental process may be approaching a point of 'dangerous  interference' between process and substance. She supported  Party-driven change and a simplified agenda.

### PART I: AGENDAS - CONTENT, TIMING AND ADOPTION

Chair Sach pointed  to discussion questions on: how and whether to improve agenda  management; whether the existing agendas adequately cover issues  of importance to Parties; whether to have a multi-year programme  of work; the frequency of consideration of agenda items; and how  to deal with agenda items held in abeyance.

###     Remarks by commentators

Outi Berghäll, Finland, stressed the need  to rethink the intergovernmental process. She suggested classifying  agenda items into four categories, namely 'indispensable,'  'useful,' 'nice to know,' and 'wasteful.' She said indispensable  items should be included on each agenda, but wasteful items should  be dropped.

Gao Feng, China, said that developing countries with small  delegations struggle under the expanding UNFCCC agenda. Pointing  to examples in other processes, he stressed the option to consider  items less frequently, possibly through a multi-year work programme.  He cautioned that limiting the time for which items can be held in  abeyance is 'politically risky.' Farhana Yamin, University of Sussex, suggested that the agenda  could be issue based, not article based. She stressed the need to  integrate the formal UNFCCC process with the informal processes,  including side-events, in order to enhance the efficiency of  resources invested in the process.

###     Discussion

NORWAY, with DENMARK, supported less frequent  consideration of agenda items that do not require action at each  session. CHINA said prioritization of agenda items should be based  on technical, and not political, criteria. INDIA said the  intersessional period could be used more effectively, and proposed  that session documents be made available earlier on the  Secretariat's website. The NETHERLANDS stressed, inter alia, the  need for: fixed criteria and time-frames for COP and COP/MOP work;  a multi-year work programme; and issue clustering. SAUDI ARABIA  said the current frequency of COPs should be maintained and that  there should not be time limits on issues in abeyance. DENMARK  noted that mandates of contact groups are often too focused,  leaving chairs unable to trade off or balance issues. SOUTH AFRICA  said negotiators have become too focused and have lost track of  what the UNFCCC is about, making big issues out of small  technicalities. The US supported multi-year work programmes, new  mechanisms for clustering issues, and a greater focus on  scientific issues in SBSTA. JAPAN suggested deadlines on items in  abeyance and stated that COPs should be held annually to maintain  public interest.

### PART II

BUILDING BLOCKS - COP AND SB SESSIONS, WORKSHOPS AND  CONSTITUTED BODIES: Chair Sach outlined the issues for  consideration, including: whether the 'building blocks' of the  process are sufficiently robust; the frequency of COP and SB  sessions; organization of high-level segments beyond COP-10;  in-session arrangements; functioning of the process; and whether  the process is achieving results commensurate with its costs.

###     Remarks by commentators

Taha Balafrej, Morocco, suggested a cycle  of one COP/MOP each year and one COP every two years. He said SBs  should last one week, questioned the merit of ministerials, and  suggested that more authority be given to constituted bodies to  make and adopt decisions.

Howard Bamsey, Australia, emphasized the value of having a strong  Secretariat, accommodating side-events and holding workshops and  other informal activities. He suggested using the Commission on  Sustainable Development's model of alternating assessment- and  policy-focused meetings. Bamsey recommended abolishing the SBs and  moving the Secretariat to New York or Geneva to encourage greater  intersessional dialogue between diplomatic missions.

Tom Jacob, International Climate Change Partnership, questioned  whether actors involved in the UNFCCC process are those best  suited to play a facilitative role. He suggested creating space  for the constitution of an informal group, composed of governments  and other stakeholders, to work with the Secretariat to meet the  global climate change challenge.

###     Discussion

The US suggested that the length of the appointment  period for COP Presidents could be extended. He pointed to the  uneven balance of having both ministers, who know little about the  UNFCCC, and senior officials, who are well aware of the issues, at  high-level segments. INDIA said regular high-level segments are  important to demonstrate political commitment, but suggested  reviewing the effectiveness of the recent high-level panels and  round-table discussions. NORWAY said the presence of ministers  helps raise public awareness of climate change issues. The  NETHERLANDS supported annual COPs and ministerials, and noted that  workshops are helpful, but can be improved. CHINA said that some  delegations have sufficient autonomy to make decisions without the  presence of ministers.

### WRAP-UP

In conclusion, Chair Sach summarized the discussions,  which he said should not be considered conclusive, and noted that  the Secretariat will prepare a report for SBI-22. He said that,  although the discussion lacked a 'revolutionary spirit,' comments  reflected broad agreement that the intergovernmental process needs  to be adjusted on a number of levels.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With the sun shining on a beautiful Saturday in Buenos Aires, many  delegates found themselves intrigued in side-events and beleaguered  in contact groups at La Rural. Many delegates lamented progress on  SBI issues, possibly worse than in previous years. As some  delegates noted, the intention to block progress on the issues by  a small group of countries may be directly related to the fact  that the Kyoto Protocol will soon enter into force. On the other  hand, progress was made on some SBSTA issues, with delegates  applauding the success of reaching agreement on the rules for  small-scale afforestation and reforestation activities under the  CDM.
