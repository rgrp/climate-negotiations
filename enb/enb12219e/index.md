abstract: "The eighteenth sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB-18) to the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  were held from 4-13 June 2003, at the Maritim Hotel in Bonn,  Germany. Over 1288 participants representing 137 Parties, one  observer State, 107 observer organizations, and six media outlets  were in attendance. At SB-18, delegates continued to address  issues under negotiation since COP-8 and prepare for the Kyoto  Protocol's entry into force. Throughout the meeting, Parties  convened in contact groups, informal consultations, and plenary  sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) and  Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) to  adopt draft conclusions and approve draft COP decisions on a  number of issues, including: the Special Climate Change Fund  (SCCF); implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse  effects); capacity building; the programme budget for the biennium  2004-2005; definitions and modalities for including afforestation  and reforestation activities under Protocol Article 12 (Clean  Development Mechanism); 'good practices' in policies and measures  (P&Ms); the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR); and methodological  issues."

Since the UNFCCC was adopted in 1992, negotiators have been busy  constructing a Protocol strong enough to meet the challenge of  climate change. With Russia's ratification, the Kyoto Protocol  will enter into force. SB-18 may not have sent a stream of  positive signals to Moscow or other Annex I Parties, but positive  signs were perceptible in discussions on several issues that  relate to the regime's effectiveness and the future direction of  negotiations.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  the global environment, with negative impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to a change in the climate. According to  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects  of climate change have already been observed, and a majority of  scientists believe that precautionary and prompt action is  necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid 'dangerous  interference' with the climate system. Controlled gases include  methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon dioxide. The  UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994. It now has 188 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, and charged it with reaching agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries with economies in transition to a market  economy (EITs) to achieve quantified emissions reduction targets.  These countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed  to reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at  least 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 (the first  commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to  country. The Protocol also established three mechanisms to assist  Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost-effectively  - an emissions trading system, joint implementation (JI) of  emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties, and a Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM) that encourages projects in non-Annex  I (developing country) Parties.

At subsequent meetings, Parties negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how countries will cut emissions  and measure and assess emissions reductions. To enter into force,  the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC, and by  Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total carbon  dioxide emissions for 1990. With Switzerland's announcement of its  ratification on 3 June 2003, the Protocol now has 111 Parties,  including 32 Annex I Parties, representing 44.2% of carbon dioxide  emissions for 1990.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

In November 1998, Parties met at  COP-4 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and agreed a decision known as  the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA). The BAPA set COP-6 as the  deadline for reaching agreement on the operational details of the  Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC. Issues  to be addressed include rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime  for assessing Parties' compliance, accounting methods for national  emissions and emissions reductions, and rules on crediting  countries for carbon sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries particularly vulnerable to the adverse  effects of climate change or to actions taken by industrialized  countries to combat climate change.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed SB-13 were held in The Hague,  the Netherlands, in November 2000. Positions on the key issues  remained entrenched, with little indication of willingness to  compromise. During the second week of negotiations, COP-6  President Jan Pronk (Netherlands) attempted to facilitate  negotiations on the many disputed political and technical issues  by convening high-level informal plenary sessions. After almost 36  hours of intense talks in the final two days of COP-6, negotiators  could not agree on a range of issues, particularly financial  issues, supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms, compliance  and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). On Saturday  afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk announced that delegates  had failed to reach agreement. Delegates agreed to suspend COP-6  and resume negotiations in 2001.

### COP-6 PART II

In March 2001, the US repudiated the Protocol,  stating that it considered the Protocol to be 'fatally flawed,' as  it would damage its economy and exempt developing countries from  emissions reduction targets. Parties reconvened at COP-6 Part II  and SB-14, in July 2001, in Bonn, Germany. After protracted  consultations, President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft  political decision. Despite support from several Parties,  disagreements surfaced over the nature of the compliance regime.  After several days of consultations, ministers agreed to adopt  President Pronk's political decision, with a revised section on  compliance on 25 July 2001. The political decision - or 'Bonn  Agreements' - needed to be operationalized through COP decisions.  These decisions were considered a 'package,' and since no  agreement was reached on the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF,  all draft decisions were forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates continued discussions on the Bonn Agreements at  COP-7 and SB-15 in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October to 10  November 2001. After lengthy negotiations, a package deal on  LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), and  input to the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) was  proposed on 8 November. Although the deal was accepted by most  regional groups, some Annex I Parties, including Australia, Canada,  Japan, New Zealand and the Russian Federation, did not join the  consensus. They disputed, among other things, eligibility  requirements and credit banking under the mechanisms. However,  following extensive negotiations, the 'Marrakesh Accords' were  agreed, with key features including consideration of LULUCF  Principles and limited banking of units generated by sinks under  the CDM.

### SB-16

Parties met at SB-16 in Bonn from 5-14 June 2002.  Participants considered several issues previously left off the  agenda due to the pressing BAPA negotiations. Views on the  direction of the climate process differed, with some Parties  looking back to recent debates and others looking ahead toward the  next commitment period. Many expressed their hopes the Protocol  could enter into force by the WSSD in August 2002. The EU and  Japan announced their Protocol ratifications just prior to the  WSSD.

### COP-8

Delegates to COP-8 and SB-17 met from 23 October to 1  November 2002, in New Delhi, India. On the final day of COP-8,  they adopted the Delhi Declaration on Climate Change and  Sustainable Development. The Declaration reaffirms development and  poverty eradication as overriding priorities in developing  counties, and recognizes Parties' common but differentiated  responsibilities and national development priorities and  circumstances in the implementation of UNFCCC commitments. Parties  at COP-8 considered institutional and procedural issues under the  Protocol and adopted several decisions, including on the rules and  procedures for the CDM.

# SB-18 REPORT

The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA)  met from 4-13 June 2003. Parties convened in plenary meetings,  contact groups, and informal consultations to consider various  technical and methodological issues. As a result of these meetings,  draft conclusions were adopted on a number of issues and draft COP  and COP/MOP decisions were agreed to be recommended for adoption  by COP-9. The conclusions and draft decisions addressed  methodological issues, including: review of methodological work  under the UNFCCC and Protocol; issues relating to Protocol  Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information), and 8 (review of information); issues relating to  reporting and review of Annex I greenhouse gas inventories;  definitions and modalities for including afforestation and  reforestation activities under Protocol Article 12 (CDM); good  practice guidance and other information on land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF); and emissions resulting from fuel  used in international aviation and maritime transportation. The  conclusions and draft decisions also addressed: the IPCC Third  Assessment Report (TAR); development and transfer of technologies;  'good practices' in policies and measures (P&Ms); research and  systematic observation (R&SO); cooperation with relevant  international organizations; and other matters, including issues  relating to cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy and  issues relating to the implementation of Protocol Article 2.3  (adverse effects of P&Ms).

The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) met from 4-13 June.  Delegates adopted draft conclusions and recommended draft  decisions to be forwarded to COP-9 on: Annex I national  communications; non-Annex I financial matters, including the  Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) and provision of financial and  technical support; capacity building; matters relating to the  least developed countries (LDCs) under UNFCCC Article 4.9; UNFCCC  Article 6 (education, training and public awareness); arrangements  for intergovernmental meetings; and administrative and financial  matters.

A request from countries of Central Asia, the Caucasus, Albania  and Moldova (CACAM) on their status under the UNFCCC was forwarded  to SB-19. Delegates also considered the implementation of decision  5/CP.7 on UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects), but failed  to reach agreement on any conclusions.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

On Wednesday, 4 June, SBSTA Chair Halldór Thorgeirsson (Iceland)  welcomed delegates to SBSTA-18. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke  Waller-Hunter said that SBSTA's discussions would shape its future  work programme. Morocco, on behalf of the G-77/China, appealed for  a focus on adaptation, and emphasized the need to operationalize  the Funds created under the Protocol and UNFCCC. He also called  for a reversal in the decline of funding for the participation of  developing country delegations, and for the Protocol's entry into  force. The EU said that work on methodologies should ensure the  integrity of inventories. Tuvalu, on behalf of the Alliance of  Small Island States (AOSIS), said that the IPCC TAR should inform  discussions on the development of the climate regime. Switzerland  announced that it had ratified the Kyoto Protocol on 2 June 2003.

SBSTA then adopted its agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/1) without  amendment.

# IPCC TAR

The agenda sub-items on scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to,  climate change, and scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of mitigation were considered together. The IPCC TAR was  taken up by the SBSTA on Wednesday, 4 June, and subsequently  addressed in a contact group co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK) and  Walid Al-Malik (United Arab Emirates). After negotiations in four  contact group meetings and numerous informal consultations held  from 4-12 June, delegates reached agreement on the draft  conclusions, which the SBSTA adopted on Friday, 13 June.

At the SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday, 4 June, the G-77/China, said  the TAR's conclusions should be used cautiously. China noted the  'widespread suspicion or disagreement' associated with some of the  conclusions, and suggested that SBSTA request further comments  from the IPCC regarding those conclusions. Switzerland said that  the TAR should be routinely considered in all agenda items and,  opposed by the G-77/China, suggested that future annotated agendas  should reference the TAR. Australia, with Canada, the EU and AOSIS,  supported discussions on the TAR as a separate agenda item. AOSIS  also noted that SBSTA so far had failed to successfully integrate  the TAR's findings into its work. Canada emphasized the need for  discussions on cross-cutting issues relating to both adaptation  and mitigation.

At the first contact group meeting on Thursday, 5 June, Parties  debated whether the contact group should focus on the process for  considering the TAR, or on substantive matters related to the TAR.  China, supported by the EU and G-77/China, suggested focusing on  the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation  and mitigation. Co-Chair Warrilow cautioned that participants may  not be sufficiently prepared for an in-depth technical discussion.  Saudi Arabia said adaptation should be addressed in the context of  UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects).

On Friday, 6 June, Co-Chair Warrilow provided an overview of draft  conclusions and elements of a draft decision. Following discussion,  delegates agreed that they needed more time to consider the text.

On Saturday, 7 June, the contact group considered the Co-Chairs'  draft conclusions. The G-77/China and the US opposed establishing  a process for considering the TAR in COP and SB agenda items.  Canada questioned the need to explicitly note that SBSTA consider  documents other than the TAR when informing COP and SB agenda  items. The G-77/China, the Russian Federation and the US objected  to text requesting the Secretariat to develop a draft work  programme on the TAR. The US, supported by Canada and New Zealand,  and opposed by Saudi Arabia, proposed that the Secretariat produce  an information paper on links between the TAR and other agenda  items. The G-77/China preferred addressing mitigation and  adaptation separately, and opposed considering integrated  approaches to adaptation and mitigation. Canada, the US, EU, New  Zealand, and Australia said that cross-cutting elements of  mitigation and adaptation should be addressed and that a side  event would be helpful in advancing knowledge on these elements.

On Tuesday, 10 June, the contact group continued deliberations on  the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions. Several delegates opposed Co- Chair Warrilow's suggestion that Parties compile a list of  provisional work-programme elements. They stressed that before  considering text on a work programme, agreement was needed on  whether to address scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects  of adaptation and mitigation in one or two SBSTA agenda items, and  on the elements of the proposed work programme. The G-77/China,  opposed by the EU, Japan and the US, questioned the utility of  intersessional consultations on the TAR prior to SBSTA-19.  Australia, New Zealand and the US said adaptation and mitigation  could be considered as separate agenda items. Canada, the EU,  Japan and Switzerland, opposed by the G-77/China, preferred to  consider adaptation and mitigation under one agenda item.

Following informal consultations in the afternoon on Wednesday, 11  June, Parties met informally in the evening to consider a revised  version of the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions. Following further  informal consultations, the contact group completed its work on  Thursday, 12 June.

In the SBSTA Plenary on Friday, 13 June, contact group Co-Chair  Warrilow introduced the draft conclusions, which the SBSTA adopted  with a minor amendment.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.15), the  SBSTA recalls that in general the TAR should be used routinely for  providing information on deliberation of COP and SB agenda items.  The SBSTA also:decides to initiate as two agenda items the scientific,  technical and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation, and of  mitigation; invites Parties to submit, by 30 October 2003, their views on  the elements, scope and priorities of the work to be undertaken  under these two agenda items; requests the Secretariat to organize a pre-sessional  consultation prior to SBSTA-19 with participation of the IPCC and  others; and agrees that, in considering the two new agenda items, it will  take note of the possible links between the scientific, technical  and socioeconomic aspects of adaptation and mitigation, and the  objectives of the UNFCCC and sustainable development.

# METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

### REVIEW OF METHODOLOGICAL WORK UNDER THE UNFCCC AND PROTOCOL

This  issue was considered by the SBSTA on Wednesday, 4 June, and taken  up in informal consultations facilitated by Harald Dovland  (Norway), with the aim of identifying methodological work to be  undertaken and considering elements of a possible work programme.

On Wednesday, 5 June, the IPCC reported on its work to revise the  1996 inventory guidelines, as requested at SBSTA-17. Delegates  raised the need to, inter alia: identify methodological needs from  thematic discussions; distinguish between methodologies for  uniform application and those specific to national circumstances;  and involve a broad range of scientists with expertise on  different issues.

On Thursday, 12 June, Harald Dovland reported on the informal  consultations, noting that the annex to the draft conclusions,  containing initial proposals by Parties on elements of a possible  future work programme, remains entirely bracketed. Parties then  adopted the draft conclusions with the bracketed annex.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.8), the  SBSTA notes: the importance of organizing methodological work in  an effective and efficient manner; the need to prioritize its  methodological work; and the importance of reliable information.  The SBSTA requests the Secretariat to prepare a paper taking stock  of the availability, accessibility and comparability of existing  sources of emissions data and relevant socioeconomic data, and to  develop options for the development, hosting and management of a  data interface, for consideration at SBSTA-19.

The SBSTA also decides to continue considering proposals by  Parties on provisional elements of a possible future work  programme at SBSTA-19, and invites further submissions.

Regarding information provided by the IPCC on the planned revision  of its 1996 inventory guidelines, the SBSTA invites the IPCC to  report on the progress of this work at SBSTA-19, and possibly at  future sessions.

### ISSUES RELATING TO PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The matter of  technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article  5.2 (adjustments), and issues relating to the implementation of  Article 8 (review of information), were considered by the SBSTA on  Wednesday, 4 June, and in seven contact group meetings from 4-11  June. On Thursday, 12 June, the SBSTA recommended two draft  decisions for adoption by COP-9, along with two draft decisions  for the COP to forward to the COP/MOP. Informal consultations on  registries under Article 7.4 were also held throughout SBSTA-18,  and draft conclusions were adopted by the SBSTA on Thursday, 12  June.

On Wednesday, 4 June, Audun Rosland (Norway) reported on the  workshop held on Article 5.2 from 7-9 April 2003, in Lisbon,  Portugal. Chair Thorgeirsson requested Helen Plume (New Zealand)  and Newton Paciornik (Brazil) to co-chair a contact group to  consider the issue, as well as issues relating to the  implementation of Article 8.

On Article 7.4 (registries), Murray Ward (New Zealand) summarized  pre-sessional consultations on registries and the transaction log,  held on 2 June 2003. He said that the consultations had focused on  the elaboration of data-exchange standards and the sharing of  experiences regarding the development of national registries. He  underscored the need for sufficient funding to allow the  Secretariat to continue its work on this issue. Chair Thorgeirsson  said Murray Ward would facilitate informal consultations on this  matter. On Thursday, 12 June, Murray Ward reported on informal  consultations, and Parties adopted the draft conclusions.

On Wednesday, 4 June, the contact group co-chaired by Helen Plume  and Newton Paciornik, convened to address: criteria for selection  of lead reviewers; training of expert review teams (ERTs);  treatment of confidential information; the improvement of the  performance and professionalism of ERTs; and completion of  technical guidance on adjustments and discussions on Article 8.  Delegates agreed that both Secretariat staff and ERT members shall  be trained and tested in procedures to protect confidential  information. On Friday, 6 June, delegates addressed disclosure of  information during the review process, and questioned whether the  Party being reviewed would be privy to information on the review.  On training, delegates discussed the status of experts who fail  examinations, and whether examinations should be mandatory and  courses should have final seminars.

On Saturday, 7 June, the contact group deliberated the draft COP  and COP/MOP decisions on training programmes for ERT members.  Canada expressed interest in contributing resources to the basic  course on review of inventories. The EU preferred prioritizing the  LULUCF training module, if resources are limited. On Monday, 9  June, Parties debated desirable language requirements for lead  reviewers, and agreed to the draft technical guidance on  methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2.

On Wednesday, 11 June, delegates discussed at length the code of  practice for the treatment of confidential information, agreeing  that the Agreement on Expert Review Services be based on the  elements outlined in the code of practice, and any additional  elements arising from consideration of consequences for breach of  the agreement. Parties agreed to the outstanding draft COP and  COP/MOP decisions and their annexes, apart from a paragraph on  language requirements for lead reviewers. China and Japan agreed  to discuss this outstanding issue informally.

In the SBSTA Plenary on Thursday, 12 June, contact group Co-Chair  Helen Plume reported on outcomes of the group's work. Parties  agreed to recommend draft COP and COP/MOP decisions on technical  guidance on methodologies for adjustments under Article 5.2 and an  addendum to these draft decisions. Following an amendment, Parties  agreed to recommend draft COP and COP/MOP decisions on the  implementation of Article 8, including the training programme for  ERT members for the initial review under the guidelines for review  under Article 8, and criteria for selecting lead reviewers.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6), the  SBSTA recommends COP-9 to adopt a decision on issues relating to  the implementation of Article 8, namely:a training programme for ERT members participating in the  initial review under Article 8; a code of practice for the treatment of confidential  information in the review of inventories under Article 8; an agreement for expert review services for members of the  ERTs participating in reviews under Article 8; and criteria for selecting lead reviewers participating in ERTs  under Article 8.

The SBSTA also welcomes the results of the adjustments workshop,  and takes note of the report on the intersessional consultations  on registries. It also calls on Annex II Parties to make further  contributions for work on the transaction log and the technical  standards for data exchange.

###     COP and COP/MOP Draft Decisions

In the draft COP-9 decision on  technical guidance on methodologies for adjustments  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6/Add.2), the COP recommends that COP/MOP-1  adopt the draft decision on this matter and an addendum to these  draft decisions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6/Add.3). The addendum includes  three annexes on the list of inventory review resources relevant  for the calculation of adjustments, provisions in the guidelines  for review under Article 8 relating to adjustments, and a table of  conservativeness factors. In the draft COP-9 decision on issues  relating to the implementation of Article 8  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.6/Add.1), the COP recommends a draft decision  on the same matter for adoption by COP/MOP-1, including two  annexes. The annexes include the training programme for ERT  members for the initial review under the guidelines for review  under Article 8, and criteria for selection of lead reviewers.

### ISSUES RELATING TO REPORTING AND REVIEW OF ANNEX I INVENTORIES

On  Wednesday, 4 June, Chair Thorgeirsson said he would prepare draft  conclusions on issues relating to reporting and review of  greenhouse gas inventories under the UNFCCC. He said the related  issues of training of ERT members for the initial review under the  guidelines for review under Protocol Article 8 (review of  information) and the treatment of confidential information  reported under the Protocol would be addressed by the contact  group on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8. On Thursday, 12 June, SBSTA  adopted the draft conclusions, and agreed to recommend a draft  decision for adoption by COP-9.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.7), the  SBSTA takes note of the information on pilot training activities  for ERT members for the technical reviews of inventories of Annex  I Parties under the UNFCCC, and the information on treatment of  confidential data in the technical review of inventories. The  SBSTA requests the Secretariat to complete preparation of the  basic course on the review of inventories with a view to  implementing it in 2004.

The SBSTA also recommends that COP-9 adopt the draft decision  relating to the technical review of greenhouse gas inventories for  Annex I Parties under the UNFCCC.

###     COP Draft Decision

The draft COP decision  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.7/Add.1) on issues relating to the technical  review of greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I Parties under  the UNFCCC contains a training programme for ERT members for the  technical reviews of inventories, a code of practice for the  treatment of confidential information in the technical review of  inventories, and elements for inclusion in the Agreement for  Expert Review Services for members of ERTs.

### SINKS IN THE CDM

This issue was first addressed in the SBSTA  Plenary on Wednesday, 4 June. A contact group co-chaired by  Karsten Sach (Germany) and Thelma Krug (Brazil) met five times  from 4-12 June. A number of drafting groups also met. The group  prepared draft conclusions, which were adopted by SBSTA on Friday,  13 June.

On Wednesday, 4 June, delegates considered the results of the  workshops on modalities and definitions for including  afforestation and reforestation (A&R) project activities under CDM,  held in Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil, from 12-14 February 2003, which had  helped to prepare draft consolidated text on modalities and  definitions.

On Thursday, 5 June, Co-Chair Krug called attention to the  proposed insurance and temporary units' approaches for addressing  non-permanence. AOSIS recalled that the modalities under  discussion are to apply in the first commitment period only, and,  with the EU, did not support a stand-alone insurance approach.  Canada also addressed questions regarding its insurance approach  and proposed new text requiring, inter alia, that Annex I Parties  holding 'flagged certified emissions reduction units' replace  these units if insurers default on their replacement obligation.

On Saturday, 7 June, delegates exchanged views on proposed  guidelines for socioeconomic and environmental impact assessments,  contained in an annex to the consolidated negotiating text. The G-77/China suggested these issues be addressed in the body of the  text, instead of the annex. The EU, G-77/China and Switzerland  emphasized the need to design guidelines according to specific  country needs. The Africa Group requested voluntary assistance and  active stakeholder participation in A&R CDM project implementation.

On Wednesday, 11 June, New Zealand introduced a document on  definitions, which combines Parties' submissions. Colombia  indicated that carbon pools should be accounted for 'within the  project boundary' and the EU and AOSIS said the proposed  definitions on the 'project boundary' should be amended to  differentiate between boundaries relevant to accounting methods  and those exclusively geographical in nature. On project  monitoring, Bolivia questioned how to estimate and control leakage.  In the final contact group, on Thursday, 12 June, delegates  discussed the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions and negotiating text.  The G-77/China addressed the need to define non-permanence and  consider uncertainty, while others noted the importance of  developing modalities for small-scale CDM projects.

The SBSTA adopted the draft conclusions on Friday, 13 June.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.13), the  SBSTA: notes that it made progress on definitions and modalities  for including A&R project activities under the CDM in the first  commitment period; requests the Secretariat to organize pre- sessional consultations to give further consideration to the draft  negotiating text; and agrees to continue its work on the draft  negotiating text at SBSTA-19.

The draft negotiating text also contains an annex on modalities  and procedures for A&R project activities under the CDM. The annex  contains a number of brackets on: definitions of forest,  reforestation, and afforestation; carbon pools; project boundary;  baseline net greenhouse gas removals by sinks; actual net  greenhouse gas removals by sinks; leakage; temporary removal;  insured Certified Emissions Reduction (CER); the role of the CDM  Executive Board; accreditation and designation of operational  entities; participation requirements; validation and registration;  monitoring; verification and certification; issuance of various  types of CERs; and non-permanence of projects. The annex also  contains a bracketed appendix, providing guidance on the  socioeconomic and environmental impacts of project design to  facilitate the preparation of national guidelines.

### GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE AND OTHER INFORMATION ON LULUCF

IPCC good  practice guidance and other information on LULUCF were discussed  in the SBSTA on Wednesday, 4 June, and draft conclusions were  adopted on Thursday, 12 June. Informal consultations were  facilitated by Margaret Mukahanana-Sangarwe (Zimbabwe) and Audun  Rosland (Norway).

On Wednesday, 4 June, the IPCC reported on its work on LULUCF and  the second-order drafts regarding good practice guidance, and  definitions and methodological options to inventory emissions from  direct human-induced degradation of forests and devegetation of  other vegetation types. Reporting on the work of the Collaborative  Partnership on Forests, the FAO noted the importance of, inter  alia, consistent forest and carbon-related terminology and  rationalized methods for assessing forest carbon stocks and their  changes.

On Thursday, 12 June, the SBSTA adopted the draft conclusions,  which are based on the three IPCC tasks, including: good practice  guidance on LULUCF; definitions on degradation and devegetation;  and the factoring out of natural and indirect human effects on  carbon stock change.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.3), the  SBSTA notes the possible inclusion of methods to estimate the  change in carbon stored in harvested wood products as an annex or  appendix to the IPCC report on good practice guidance for LULUCF,  and requests the IPCC to submit a report on this subject for  consideration by SBSTA-19, as well as to organize a side-event on  good practice guidance for LULUCF during SBSTA-19. It also notes  that issues related to harvested wood products will continue to be  considered at SBSTA-19 and subsequent sessions. The SBSTA also  requests the Secretariat, in consultation with the IPCC, to  prepare draft common reporting formats for LULUCF for  consideration at SBSTA-19, and invites the IPCC to report progress  on the development of practicable methodologies and effects due to  past practices in forests at SBSTA-19, including plans for a  review process.

### EMISSIONS RESULTING FROM FUEL USED IN INTERNATIONAL AVIATION AND  MARITIME TRANSPORTATION

This issue was first addressed by the  SBSTA on Wednesday, 4 June. Chair Thorgeirsson said Greg Terrill  (Australia) would conduct informal consultations on the matter.  Following informal consultations throughout SB-18, the SBSTA  adopted draft conclusions on Thursday, 12 June.

On Wednesday, 4 June, the International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) stressed the need for more reliable aviation  emissions inventories, and described its continuing work on:  policy options to limit or reduce aviation emissions; the  development of technology and related worldwide emissions  standards; the reduction of fuel burn through improved operational  measures; and the use of market-based mechanisms. The  International Maritime Organization (IMO) discussed its work to  improve the quality of reporting and comparability of greenhouse  gas emissions from ships, and reported on the informal meeting  between the UNFCCC and IMO Secretariats.

On Thursday, 12 June, Greg Terrill introduced the draft  conclusions. Argentina expressed its concern that greenhouse gas  emissions from international flights have increased by 50% within  the period 1990-2000. The SBSTA then adopted the draft conclusions.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.2), the  SBSTA invites the IMO, ICAO and UNFCCC Secretariats to set up two  expert meetings before SBSTA-19 to discuss options to improve the  methodologies for estimating and reporting emissions from  international aviation and maritime transportation.

# DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

This agenda item was considered by SBSTA on Thursday, 5 June, and  in informal consultations facilitated by Kishan Kumarsingh  (Trinidad and Tobago) and Terry Carrington (UK). SBSTA considered  and adopted the draft conclusions on Thursday, 12 June.

At the SBSTA Plenary on Thursday, 5 June, William Agyemang-Bonsu  (Ghana), Chair of the Experts Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT)  reported on the work of the EGTT. Delegates highlighted the need  for: broad stakeholder participation and transparency in creating  enabling environments for technology transfer; concrete actions to  implement the outcomes of the EGTT and the technology assessments;  and attention to the broader issue of technology development.  Informal consultations were conducted to consider the results of  the workshop on enabling environments, held in Ghent, Belgium,  from 9-10 April 2003, and to prepare draft conclusions on further  guidance to the EGTT. On 12 June, the SBSTA adopted the draft  conclusions on this matter.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In these conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.5), the  SBSTA notes the report of the EGTT, which concludes that the  success of technology transfer is dependent on wide stakeholder  involvement, and that governments have a crucial role in creating  favorable conditions. It encourages business and industry NGOs and  relevant international organizations to convene sector-specific  workshops and activities to exchange experiences and lessons  learned.

The SBSTA requests the EGTT to consider including activities on  the development of environmentally sound technologies in its work  activities, consider the outcomes of the workshop on synergies,  and recommend further actions to SBSTA. It also requests the  Secretariat to organize senior-level round-table discussions  between governments, business and industry at COP-9, and a special  meeting of the EGTT in conjunction with the technology events  planned by the Government of India in November 2003; and continue  its work on the development of links with relevant technology  information systems and clearing houses, and existing  national/regional technology centers as a way of showcasing  potential opportunities for technology transfer identified through  Parties' technology needs assessment. The Secretariat is requested  to report on the outcomes of the activities to SBSTA at its  subsequent sessions.

# 'GOOD PRACTICES' IN POLICIES AND MEASURES

This issue was first addressed by the SBSTA on Thursday, 5 June,  and subsequently in a contact group co-chaired by Greg Terrill  (Australia) and Richard Muyungi (Tanzania). Following four  meetings of the contact group from 6-11 June, delegates agreed on  draft conclusions, which the SBSTA adopted on Friday, 13 June.

At the SBSTA Plenary on Thursday, 5 June, Chair Thorgeirsson  recalled that implementing decision 13/CP.7 (P&Ms) could include  two pathways: strengthening web-based approaches for exchanging  information; and engaging in further methodological work to  develop and assess P&Ms. In the context of national circumstances,  several delegates said that information exchange has been valuable  in highlighting the effectiveness of P&Ms. In addition to inviting  non-Annex I Parties to benefit from information sharing,  Switzerland, with Australia and Canada, supported a standing  agenda item on P&Ms. Saudi Arabia said that discussions should be  limited to Annex I Parties. The EU called for additional workshops  and web-based tools. Japan, with Australia, said that P&Ms should  be self-assessed. A contact group was convened to develop draft  conclusions and a draft COP decision focusing on information  exchange.

At the first meeting of the contact group on Friday, 6 June, the  EU, supported by the US, suggested holding workshops to share  information on sector or sub-sector specific activities. The G-77/China said information sharing should focus on the adverse  effects of P&Ms on developing countries. The US, supported by  Samoa, suggested that the Secretariat develop terms of reference  (TOR), referring to adverse effects, for future workshops in  accordance with decision 13/CP.7. The G-77/China opposed  additional workshops, regardless of their TOR, citing budgetary  constraints and the need for 'a total discussion' on the  implementation of decision 13/CP.7. Japan suggested further  enhancing web-based information exchange.

On Monday, 9 June, Co-Chair Terrill introduced a proposal for  draft conclusions. The G-77/China said the text should refer only  to Annex I Parties and should not directly or indirectly encourage  non-Annex I Parties to share information. Samoa said all Parties  could benefit from information sharing, even if actions to share  information are only taken by Annex I Parties. The US said  information sharing between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties would  facilitate capacity-building and technology-transfer activities.  The G-77/China, opposed by Australia, the EU, Japan, and the US,  requested that text referring to information sharing at side  events be deleted. Regarding web-based approaches to information  sharing, the US expressed concern that the need to update a  website might create a new type of reporting requirement.

On Tuesday, 10 June, Co-Chair Muyungi introduced new draft  conclusions. Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the G-77/China, objected  to text referring to information exchange among 'all Parties,' and  to text 'inviting Annex I Parties and other interested Parties' to  share information during informal round-tables. He also said that  the Co-Chairs' proposal to hold informal round-tables during  session time seemed unworkable. Samoa said it did not share all of  the concerns expressed by Saudi Arabia. Following a short break  for consultations, the G-77/China was unable to agree on a united  position on the text. The EU and Japan requested the deletion of a  sentence calling for information exchange on ways to minimize  adverse effects of response measures. With the US, they encouraged  further discussion on the option of holding round-tables.

On Wednesday, 11 June, Parties discussed the Co-Chairs' draft  conclusions paragraph-by-paragraph. The EU and Japan, opposed by  the G-77/China, reiterated their request to delete the sentence  calling for information exchange on ways to minimize the adverse  effects of response measures. Following discussions, the EU  suggested replacing the sentence with a general reference to  decision 13/CP.7. Following informal discussions, Co-Chair Terrill  proposed new conclusions, noting the continued importance of  implementing decision 13/CP.7, and agreeing to reconsider this  agenda item at SBSTA-19. Parties agreed to the draft conclusions,  which the SBSTA adopted on Friday, 13 June.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions on P&Ms  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.12), the SBSTA welcomes the progress made in  implementing decision 13/CP.7, notes that Parties agreed on the  continuing importance of implementing this decision, and agrees to  consider further this agenda item at SBSTA-19.

# RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

This issue was taken up by SBSTA on Thursday, 5 June, and  considered in a contact group co-chaired by Stefan Rösner (Germany)  and S.N. Sok Appadu (Mauritius). The contact group met once to  finalize consideration of draft conclusions and a draft COP  decision, which were adopted by SBSTA on Thursday, 12 June.

On Thursday, 5 June, Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the pre- sessional event on R&SO, held on 2 June, which considered the  Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Second Adequacy Report.  GCOS outlined the Report's main recommendations, including the  need to: improve standards for climate observing systems, data and  products; make available products relevant to UNFCCC needs; and  build capacity and improve observing systems in developing  countries by establishing a voluntary donor fund. Canada, with the  EU and G-77/China, said governments must respond to the  observation needs of the UNFCCC. The G-77/China, with China,  Uruguay and Uganda, underscored developing countries' need for  financial support to carry out R&SO.

On Thursday, 12 June, the SBSTA adopted the draft conclusions and  agreed to forward the draft decision to the COP.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.4), the  SBSTA: notes the recommendations developed by the GCOS Second  Adequacy Report; identifies the Report as an opportunity to build  momentum among governments to improve the global observing systems  for climate; and notes the incomplete implementation of the  terrestrial ocean networks. The SBSTA also invites the GCOS  Secretariat to prepare, in consultation with the WMO, an analysis  of problems and options to removing barriers to the receipt of  data from atmospheric and hydrological networks at global data  centers, and requests Parties to submit views on priorities for  actions.

###     COP Draft Decision

In the draft decision  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.4/Add.1), the COP urges Parties to support high  priority needs by contributing to relevant funding mechanisms,  invites the GCOS sponsoring agencies to develop a framework for  the preparation of reporting guidelines for terrestrial climate  observing systems, and requests the GCOS Secretariat to coordinate  the development of a phased five- to ten-year implementation plan  for integrated global climate observing systems.

# COOPERATION WITH RELEVANT INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

This item was first addressed by the SBSTA on Friday, 6 June.  Following informal consultations throughout the meeting, Parties  adopted the Chair's draft conclusions in the SBSTA Plenary on  Thursday, 12 June, and recommended a draft decision for adoption  by COP-9.

On Friday, 6 June, statements were heard from relevant  international organizations and Parties. The Convention to Combat  Desertification (CCD) Secretariat recommended that synergies  between conventions take place at the field level. The Ramsar  Convention Secretariat noted that governments may face challenges  in simultaneously meeting their commitments under the UNFCCC and  Ramsar Convention. The IPCC provided an update on its activities.  The FAO reviewed its capacity-building work on forests and climate  change, and the IUCN noted its technical and legal support to  several developing countries on definitions and modalities for  sinks in the CDM. The Russian Federation announced its  ratification of the CCD. Switzerland, with the EU, proposed that  the UNFCCC Secretariat regularly report on relevant World Trade  Organization (WTO) activities. Canada, Colombia and the US  supported Chair Thorgeirsson's suggestion that such reporting  activities be undertaken at the national level instead. Colombia,  opposed by Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, suggested using the  Secretariat's Note on the WTO for future discussion on this issue.

On Thursday, 12 June, the SBSTA adopted the draft conclusions,  with a minor amendment.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.9), the  SBSTA: agrees to continue discussing cooperation with other  conventions at SBSTA-19; welcomes the IPCC decision to undertake  its Fourth Assessment Report; and encourages Parties to coordinate  issues relevant to the UNFCCC and the WTO at the national level.

### OTHER MATTERS

The SBSTA addressed any other matters in Plenary on  Friday, 6 June. Several Parties suggested SBSTA express support  for the World Conference on Climate Change to be held in Moscow  from 29 September to 3 October 2003. Chair Thorgeirsson said he  would hold informal consultations on this issue and prepare draft  conclusions. The SBSTA adopted draft conclusions with a minor  amendment on Friday, 13 June.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.14), the  SBSTA, inter alia, invites Parties and the Secretariat to  cooperate to achieve a successful outcome at the World Climate  Change Conference, to be held in Moscow, Russian Federation, from  29 September to 3 October 2003; welcomes the announcement by India  about a technology bazaar to be held in New Delhi from 10-13  November 2003, and a high-level round-table on 'The CDM:  opportunities for international cooperation' to be held on 10  November; and notes that, subject to the availability of financial  resources, a special meeting of the EGTT and a workshop on  adaptation will take place in Delhi during the technology bazaar.

# CLOSING PLENARY

On Friday morning, 13 June, SBSTA Rapporteur Tatyana Ososkova  (Uzbekistan) introduced the report of SBSTA-18  (FCCC/SBSTA/2003/L.1), which was subsequently adopted. Chair  Thorgeirsson thanked delegates, Co-Chairs and the Secretariat, and  said that he looked forward to SBSTA-19 in Milan. He gaveled the  meeting to a close at 11:58 am.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

SBI Chair Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria) opened the first meeting of  SBI-18 on Wednesday, 4 June, and introduced the agenda for  adoption (FCCC/SBI/2003/1). Switzerland, supported by the G-77/China, proposed the inclusion of non-Annex I national  communications on the agenda. The US, supported by Canada and  Australia, and opposed by the G-77/China, proposed that this item  address the submission of second and subsequent national  communications. Chair Stoycheva agreed to suspend the adoption of  the agenda to allow the G-77/China to consider the US proposal.

On Thursday, 5 June, Chair Stoycheva said Parties agreed to  consider the issue of non-Annex I national communications under  other matters, and the SBI adopted the agenda without amendment.

# ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The SBI addressed Annex I national communications on Friday, 6  June, and adopted the Chair's draft conclusions on Friday, 13 June.

On Friday, 6 June, the US reaffirmed its commitment to reduce its  emissions intensity and opposed the creation of new bodies to  review the communications. Australia said that while it did not  intend to ratify the Protocol, it was still committed to achieving  its emissions target under the Protocol. The G-77/China and AOSIS  expressed concern that emissions could continue to rise despite  mitigation measures, and urged Annex I Parties to implement more  rigorous policies and measures. Chair Stoycheva prepared draft  conclusions on this issue, which delegates adopted on Friday, 13  June.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.8), the SBI:  requests the Secretariat to continue presenting information based  on Annex I national communications in a manner accessible and  useful to Parties; concludes that the compilation and synthesis of  third national communications from Annex I Parties merits further  consideration by COP-9; and urges Parties that have not yet  submitted their national communications to do so as soon as  possible.

# FINANCIAL MATTERS RELATING TO NON-ANNEX I PARTIES

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND

Issues regarding the SCCF were taken  up by the SBI on Thursday, 4 June, and in five contact group  meetings, held from 7-12 June and co-chaired by Rawleston Moore  (Barbados) and Jaap Rooimans (Netherlands). On Thursday, 11 June,  delegates held informal consultations in the morning, and approved  the draft conclusions in a contact group meeting in the evening.  The SBI adopted the draft conclusions on Friday 13 June.

In the opening SBI Plenary on Thursday, 4 June, AOSIS and the   G-77/China emphasized the need for the SCCF to support adaptation  activities, and with the EU and Ghana, underscored the importance  of providing finance to countries that are not eligible for  support under existing UNFCCC funds. Saudi Arabia underscored the  importance of financing adaptation activities to address the  adverse impacts of response measures and economic diversification  activities.

A contact group was convened to define and prioritize the  activities, programmes and measures to be financed under the SCCF,  and provide operational guidance to the Global Environment  Facility (GEF). On Saturday, 7 June, delegates discussed the  prioritization of SCCF-funded activities. Several Parties  identified adaptation as the priority activity for the SCCF and  suggested that activities be based on priorities identified in  national communications, and national strategies for sustainable  development. Parties discussed the inclusion of mitigation  activities, with Canada and the EU calling for a balance between  adaptation and mitigation measures.

In the contact group on Monday, 9 June, the GEF highlighted the  importance of the COP providing clear and specific guidance in  order to avoid duplication with existing GEF activities. Delegates  discussed the need for guiding principles for the SCCF, in  particular the need to mainstream climate change into development  processes, provide for a catalytic function, and build on existing  GEF arrangements. Noting the importance of guiding principles,  AOSIS and the LDCs noted that the SCCF's principles should not  create obstacles in accessing financing.

On Tuesday, 10 June, the contact group began discussions on the  Co-Chairs' draft conclusions. On the SCCF's guiding principles,  the G-77/China said that the Fund should be complementary to the  GEF climate focal areas, the Least Developed Country (LDC) Fund,  and bilateral and multilateral funding, and maximize adaptation  funding opportunities for non-Annex I Parties not eligible for  support from the LDC Fund. Delegates also discussed the further  elaboration of views on the SCCF, with the EU reiterating its  support for a process allowing for the further submission of  Parties' views.

In the contact group meeting on Wednesday, 11 June, the G-77/China  presented its amendments to the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, and  proposed that its text serve as the basis for negotiation  (FCCC/SBI/2003/MISC.1/Add.1). Co-Chair Moore adjourned the contact  group for informal consultations on this issue. The informal  consultations agreed to base the contact group's deliberations on  the Co-Chairs' text. Delegates then continued discussing the  prioritization of the SCCF's activities, but were unable to agree  on the inclusion of mitigation activities. They agreed to delete  text requesting further submission of views and calling for  intersessional informal consultation on the SCCF prior to SBI-19.

Following informal consultations on Thursday morning, 12 June,  delegates reconvened in the contact group to approve the draft Co- Chairs' conclusions, with a minor amendment.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.13), the SBI  notes that activities to be supported by the SCCF should be  country-driven, cost effective, and integrated into national  sustainable development and poverty reduction strategies.  Regarding priorities for the SCCF, the SBI notes that Parties  identified adaptation activities to address the adverse impacts of  climate change as the highest priority, and that technology  transfer and its associated capacity-building activities should  also be supported. The SBI also emphasizes that SCCF activities  should be complementary to the LDC Fund and the climate change  focal areas of the GEF, and requests SBI-19 to provide further  guidance to the GEF for the operation of the SCCF and to recommend  a draft decision at COP-9 in this regard.

### PROVISION OF FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

In the SBI Plenary  on Friday, 6 June, the GEF reported on the outcomes of its May  2003 Council meeting, highlighting relevant decisions regarding  its support for national communications from non-Annex I Parties.  Several Parties underscored the need for the timely disbursement  of financial resources, and for holding regional and subregional  workshops on guidelines for the second national communications.  SBI Chair Stoycheva said she would prepare draft conclusions on  this issue. On Friday, 13 June, the SBI adopted the draft  conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.10), the SBI  notes that the frequency of the submission of second, and where  appropriate, third national communications shall be determined at  COP-9, and invites Parties to submit their views on the frequency  and timing of these submissions. The SBI also invites Parties'  views on their experience with the GEF or its implementing  agencies in preparing national communications.

# CAPACITY BUILDING

This agenda item was considered by the SBI on Friday, 6 June, and  in a contact group. The contact group, chaired by Dechen Tsering  (Bhutan), met four times from 6-11 June, and completed the terms  of reference (TOR) for the comprehensive review of the  implementation of decision 2/CP.7 (capacity building in developing  countries).

During the SBI meeting on Friday, 6 June, the Secretariat  presented delegates with an overview of the synthesis of  information provided by Parties relating to the comprehensive  review of decisions 2/CP.7 and 3/CP.7 (capacity building in EITs),  the views on actions by developing countries and EITs on their  priority needs, and views on actions by Annex II Parties to  implement these decisions.

On the review process, the G-77/China stressed that it should  contain an analysis of current project and programme  implementation in response to decision 2/CP.7, identify gaps and  possible areas for further improvement in implementation, and  outline steps to be undertaken by the SBI in monitoring capacity- building activities. Canada said that the review should also  include activities undertaken prior to COP-7.

During the first meeting of the contact group on Friday, 6 June,  delegates exchanged views on their expectations and on the process  of the comprehensive review of capacity-building activities in  developing countries. Based on these views, Chair Tsering  circulated a proposal for draft conclusions on Saturday, 7 June.  In discussing this proposal, delegates agreed to request the  Secretariat to prepare a compilation paper on progress in  implementing decision 2/CP.7. They discussed the inclusion of  information from other sources, such as the GEF and bilateral and  multilateral organizations. The US stressed the importance of  taking into account country-driven approaches. Given the time  constraints, delegates agreed to request COP-9 to adopt a decision  extending the review until COP-10. They also agreed to request the  COP to adopt a decision to review implementation of capacity  building in EITs.

On the TOR for the review process, Parties discussed the period  under review. The G-77/China preferred focusing on the period  after COP-7, while Canada and others noted that capacity building  was a long-term process. The contact group completed its work on  Wednesday, 11 June. The SBI adopted the draft conclusions and TOR  for the comprehensive review on Friday, 13 June.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.4), the SBI  endorses the TOR for the comprehensive review and requests the  Secretariat to prepare a paper that would support the review  process, using information from the GEF, relevant international  organizations and bilateral and multilateral agencies, to support  the review process for consideration at SBI-19. It recommends that  COP-9 decide on the actions necessary to complete the review by  COP-10 and on guidance for the review of decision 3/CP.7. The SBI  also requests the Secretariat to prepare a compilation paper to  facilitate the first review of the effectiveness of the  implementation of the decision.

# IMPLEMENTATION OF UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9

### PROGRESS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITIES UNDER DECISION 5/CP.7

This agenda item was considered by the SBI on Wednesday, 4 June. A  contact group co-chaired by Fadhel Lari (Kuwait) and Robert Mason  (UK) was convened to consider how to further the implementation of  decision 5/CP.7 (implementation of Articles 4.8 and 4.9 on adverse  effects) and met six times from 6-12 June. The SBI adopted draft  conclusions on Friday, 13 June.

On Wednesday, 4 June, the Secretariat announced a workshop  mandated by decision 5/CP.7 on possible synergies with other  multilateral environmental conventions and agreements scheduled  for 2-4 July, in Espoo, Finland. Chair Stoycheva provided an oral  report on the recent workshops on insurance-related matters,  noting that the written report was not yet ready. Delegates  discussed the outcomes of the workshops and highlighted: the need  for long-term international solutions to minimizing the adverse  effects of response measures; the importance of according the  insurance industry observer status in the climate process to  enhance their understanding of the issue; and the guidance  provided by the Marrakesh Accords for the implementation of  decision 5/CP.7.

During the first meeting of the contact group, there was  divergence over whether progress had been made in implementing  decision 5/CP.7. The EU, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand  highlighted progress made, including the GEF's third replenishment,  the establishment of the LDC Fund, and development of guidelines  for National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). The G-77/China opposed this, stating that the progress to date was  insufficient, and called for concrete actions to follow up on the  recommendations of the recent risk assessment and insurance  workshops.

Following requests by New Zealand, Australia, the US and the EU,  informal consultations were held on the agenda of the upcoming  workshop on synergies. Saudi Arabia preferred not to consider this  workshop's TOR until a date was specified for the workshop on  economic diversification, also mandated by decision 5/CP.7 to be  organized before COP-9.

On Saturday, 7 June, the Co-Chairs circulated a proposal for draft  conclusions on this agenda item. Since the G-77/China had not  consulted on the proposed draft conclusions, the meeting was  adjourned.

On Monday, 9 June, the G-77/China and EU presented their proposals  for draft conclusions. After a lengthy debate over which document  to use as the basis for discussion, delegates agreed to proceed on  the basis of the Co-Chairs' draft. Divergence remained over  language regarding the progress made. On the reports of the  workshops on insurance and risk assessment, delegates could not  agree on whether to address them in one, or in separate paragraphs.

They also discussed how to elaborate on the TOR for the workshop  on economic diversification, with the G-77/China opposing a  process of submissions, noting that this could delay the workshop.  The Secretariat revised the Co-Chairs' proposal integrating the G-77/China and EU suggestions to reflect amendments made during the  discussion.

On Tuesday, 10 June, the group met again to consider new draft  conclusions. Once again divergence emerged over whether and how to  address the outcomes of the workshops on modeling, insurance and  adverse effects and related matters. Parties revisited the  amendments and options proposed, and discussed their placement in  the draft text. During this meeting, the G-77/China proposed a new  paragraph requesting the Secretariat to compile a synthesis report  on information regarding the specific needs and concerns of  developing countries arising from the adverse effects of climate  change and response measures, and the support required to address  these. Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US proposed  alternative text listing activities relating to implementation of  decision 5/CP.7 to reflect that progress had been made. The G-77/China said that this was an unrelated proposal that did not  constitute alternative text.

On the outcomes of the modeling workshop, AOSIS proposed a  paragraph calling on SBSTA to note the need to improve support for  capacity building to developing country experts and to increase  their participation in the modeling process. The G-77/China  maintained its support for text on actions relating to the  workshop's results that could be recommended by the SBI and SBSTA.  The EU favored text noting that SBI-18 had considered the  workshop's outcomes. The G-77/China proposed text on the outcomes  of the workshops on insurance and risk assessment and on related  actions, which the EU and US opposed, citing the unavailability of  the written reports for consideration at SBI-18. AOSIS proposed  language calling on the SBI to invite further views from Parties  on the workshop outcomes for consideration by the COP with the aim  of agreeing on a decision. The US, Canada, Australia and New  Zealand supported the invitation for views but said the SBI should  not prejudge the outcome of the COP's deliberations.

After the Secretariat revised the draft conclusions, delegates  could not agree to delete some of the options. The EU, US,  Australia and AOSIS expressed disappointment over the lack of  agreement and proposed that the draft conclusions include  paragraphs on which there was some agreement. The G-77/China  preferred to state in the conclusions that there was no agreement,  or to transmit the bracketed text to SBI-19. After brief  consultations with the delegates, Co-Chair Robert Mason reported  that there was still a willingness to try and agree on some text  and said consultations would continue on Thursday.

The contact group met again on Thursday, 12 June, following  informal consultations held in the morning to try and reach  agreement on draft conclusions. Another proposal for draft  conclusions was circulated. These conclusions included the  partially agreed paragraphs. The EU, Canada, Australia, Japan, the  US, AOSIS, and New Zealand noted that while the text did not serve  all their interests, they supported its use as the basis for  negotiation. They said that if there was no agreement on the use  of this text, they would prefer stating this in the conclusions  and not forward any text to SBI-19. Saudi Arabia, Libya (on behalf  of the Africa Group), Kuwait, Venezuela, and Nigeria opposed the  use of this text, and proposed using the last version of the draft  conclusions or conclude that there was no agreement. Saudi Arabia  cautioned against setting a precedent by not forwarding any draft  texts to the next session. Recalling previous instances where  Parties have 'agreed to disagree,' the US objected stating that  Parties were not obliged to forward the penultimate text.

Co-Chair Lari noted that Parties were unable to agree and proposed  that the draft conclusions state that the SBI did not complete its  work on the agenda item and agreed to continue at the next session.  On Friday, 13 June, the SBI adopted its draft conclusions. SBI  Chair Stoycheva expressed her disappointment and welcomed Parties  to a pre-sessional meeting to consider how to continue with this  agenda item.

###     SBI Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.12) state that  the SBI did not complete its consideration of this issue.

### MATTERS RELATING TO THE LDCS

The SBI considered this agenda sub- item on Wednesday, 4 June, and in informal consultations. It  adopted draft conclusions on Friday, 13 June.

On Wednesday, 4 June, LDC Expert Group (LEG) Chair Laavasa Malua  (Samoa) reported on the work of the LEG. Delegates highlighted the  need to operationalize the LDC Fund in the short term to support  immediate and urgent needs, and to ensure that the implementation  of NAPAs enhance the synergies with other UN conventions.

On Thursday, 5 June, during the consideration of non-Annex I  financial matters, Tanzania, on behalf of the LDCs, proposed that  the matters relating to LDC Fund be addressed separately from the  SCCF. Chair Stoycheva decided to convene informal consultations on  LDC matters. These were facilitated by Mamadou Honadia (Burkina  Faso) and José Romero (Switzerland) and focused on the results of  the LEG's work and on further guidance to the LEG as well as the  LDC Fund. The draft conclusions on this item were adopted on  Friday, 13 June.

###     SBI Conclusions

In these conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.9), the SBI  notes the need for further discussions to address modalities  relating to the implementation of the NAPAs. It agrees that in  addressing other elements of the LDC work programme, attention  should be given to critical activities such as awareness raising  and capacity building. It also notes that NAPA implementation  should promote the integration of adaptation concerns into the  development process of LDCs and that the LDC Fund needs to be  complemented by other funding sources, such as development  assistance. The SBI decides to consider further guidance for the  operation of the LDC Fund at SBI-19 with a view to recommending a  decision to COP-9.

# UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public awareness) was  taken up by the SBI Plenary on Friday, 6 June. On Friday, 13 June,  the SBI adopted the Chair's draft conclusions.

At the SBI Plenary, on Friday, 6 June, Jean-Pascal van Ypersele  (Belgium) reported on the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE)  regional workshop on education, training, and public awareness.  Participants at the workshop made recommendations on aspects of  the national and international-level implementation of Article 6,  including formal and non-formal education and the need for public  awareness. Several Parties, UNEP, UNESCO and the International  Strategy for Disaster Reduction (ISDR), supported the development  of an information network clearing house. Botswana, Thailand, and  Uruguay offered to host regional workshops.

On Friday, 13 June, the SBI adopted draft conclusions with a minor  amendment.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.5), the SBI  welcomes the Secretariat's proposal for an Article 6 information  network clearing house (FCCC/SBI/2003/4) and invites the  Secretariat to: continue work on the development of the clearing  house project; report to SBI-19 on progress of work; compile  information received from non-Annex I Parties in their national  communications on Article 6 related activities; and develop a  prototype of the clearing house by SBI-21. The SBI also invites  Parties to submit to the Secretariat, by 15 August 2003, their  views on possible ways to improve reporting in their national  communications on activities aimed at implementing the New Delhi  Article 6 work programme.

# REQUEST FROM THE CACAM GROUP OF COUNTRIES

The status of the request from a group of countries of Central  Asia and the Caucasus, Albania and the Republic of Moldova (CACAM),  regarding their status under the UNFCCC was addressed in the SBI  Plenary on Friday, 6 June, and Friday, 13 June.

On Friday, 6 June, Chair Stoycheva said she would consult  informally. On Friday, 13 June, she reported that no conclusions  had been agreed, that she would continue with informal  consultations, and report on their outcomes at SBI-19. Uzbekistan,  on behalf of the CACAM group, supported by Qatar, emphasized the  importance of ensuring equal representation of these countries on  the Consultative Group of Experts on Non-Annex I National  Communications (CGE).

# ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This issue was considered by the SBI on Thursday, 5 June, and  subsequently discussed in two contact group meetings chaired by  Karsten Sach (Germany). Delegates considered the draft conclusions  on this agenda item on Friday, 13 June.

During the SBI Plenary on Thursday, 5 June, delegates considered  the agenda sub-items on the COP-9 programme of work, the  arrangements for the first session of the COP/MOP, future  sessional periods, and effective participation in the UNFCCC  process. The Secretariat presented, inter alia, two scenarios for  the programme of work: one for COP-9 and one for COP/MOP-1 in the  event of entry into force of the Protocol by COP-9.

On the organization of the COP's work, delegates discussed the  high-level round table discussions to be held at COP-9. Several  delegates underscored the need to separate work on the UNFCCC and  the Protocol. The US, with Australia, Slovenia, Norway, and Canada,  supported the consideration of a multi-year work programme, and  the streamlining of each session's agenda.

On effective participation, the US objected to the manner in which  the CDM Executive Board was implementing the rules relating to the  participation of observers. The G-77/China, with Saudi Arabia,  Burkina Faso, and the EU, called for increased funding for the  participation of delegates from developing countries. Several  delegations called for a systematic approach to ensure broad and  balanced participation in all bodies, expert groups and workshops.

During the first meeting of the contact group on Thursday, 5 June,  delegates discussed the arrangements for the intersessional  meetings and the work programme for COP-9 and COP/MOP-1. On the  organization of COP/MOP-1, delegates discussed whether to  integrate or maintain the distinction between the UNFCCC and the  Protocol. The US emphasized the need for an approach that would  not merge UNFCCC and Protocol issues, since this would have an  impact on the rights of the Parties to the UNFCCC that are not  members of the Protocol. With Saudi Arabia, he stressed the need  to prioritize the UNFCCC over the Protocol. Norway favored as much  integration as possible.

On the effective participation in the UNFCCC process, delegates  discussed how to improve observers' access to the process.  Argentina stressed the need to facilitate participation of Parties  as well as observers.

Regarding the organization of work at COP-9, there was agreement  on the need to determine the topics of the roundtable sessions,  and delegates prepared a list of themes. Delegates also discussed  how to refer to the different capacities of the SBSTA and SBI  acting under the UNFCCC and the Protocol, and the possibility for  joint meetings of the COP and COP/MOP.

On Friday, 13 June, the SBI considered the draft conclusions,  including a draft decision to be recommended to the COP. Chair  Stoycheva informed delegates that Miklós Persányi, Minister of  Environment and Water, Hungary, was nominated president of COP-9.  Hungary affirmed its commitment to maintain close cooperation with  all Parties in order to achieve progress in meeting the objective  of the UNFCCC.

###     SBI Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.3 and Add. 1)  address preparations for COP-9, the arrangements for COP/MOP-1,  future sessional periods, and effective participation in the  UNFCCC process.

On the arrangements for COP-9, the SBI decides that round table  discussions will be the mode of exchange during the high-level  segment. In the event that the COP would be held in conjunction  with the COP/MOP, political statements will be the mode of  exchanges during a joint high-level segment.

On the arrangements for COP/MOP-1, the SBI recommends that it  convene in conjunction with the first session of the COP scheduled  after the date of entry into force. The SBI also decides to:  organize meetings of the COP and COP/MOP to ensure that similar or  related items on their agendas are dealt with in proximity, or  jointly if the Parties to the UNFCCC and Protocol so decide, and  forward a draft decision on the arrangements for COP/MOP-1 for  adoption by the COP.

Regarding future sessions, the SBI notes the proposed dates for  the 2008 sessional periods (2-13 June and 1-12 December 2008). It  also notes the increasing difficulties faced by the UNFCCC process  with regard to agenda management, and invites the SBI and SBSTA  Chairs to further consider the organization of future sessions in  order to handle the workload effectively and efficiently.

Regarding effective participation in the UNFCCC process, the SBI  underlines the importance of facilitating the participation of  Parties and recognizes that participation of observers is a  fundamental feature of the UNFCCC process. It invites the Chairs  of the Subsidiary Bodies and other bodies with limited membership  and the Secretariat to continue efforts to facilitate effective  participation and promote transparency in the process and report  back at SBI-20.

###     COP Draft Decision

In the draft decision (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.3  Add.1), the COP is called on to recommend that COP/MOP-1 adopt a  draft decision on the arrangements for its first session, which  provides guidance on the application of the draft rules of  procedure.

# ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

### INTERIM FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE BIENNIUM 2002-2003

On  Wednesday, 4 June, Chair Stoycheva presented the interim financial  performance for the biennium 2002-2003, which notes outstanding  arrears of US$8.5 million. It also indicates that two-thirds of  member States have not made their contributions for 2003. The  Secretariat noted that the UN regular budget, instead of Parties'  contributions, funded conference servicing costs for the 2002-2003  biennium and that Parties would be credited as appropriate.  Morocco expressed concern about the shortfall of the Trust Fund  for Participation, and requested the Secretariat to explore the  replenishment of the Trust Fund. On Friday, June 13, SBI adopted  the draft conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.2), the SBI  expresses appreciation to the Parties who paid their contribution  to the core budget on time and urges Parties with outstanding  contributions to pay these. It also notes the concern shared by  Parties about the shortfall in the Trust Fund for Participation  and requests the Executive Secretary to explore the possibility of  the Trust Fund's replenishment.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2004-2005

This issue was  addressed by the SBI on Wednesday, 4 June, and Thursday, 5 June. A  contact group chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) met three  times from 6-10 June. Informal consultations were also held. The  SBI adopted the draft conclusions, containing a draft COP decision,  on Friday evening, 13 June.

On Wednesday, 4 June, Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter  presented the draft programme budget, which contained a 29% budget  increase for the 2003-2004 biennium. In its proposed budget, the  Secretariat estimated that US$3.2 million will be required for  Protocol activities, should it enter into force during the 2004- 2005 biennium. Saudi Arabia emphasized the need for balanced  funding in the biennial budget for items such as workshops, while  the US requested more detail on the Secretariat's budget and  expressed concern over the proposed apportionment between UNFCCC  and Protocol activities. Canada supported a 'one-time jump' in the  budget.

On Thursday, 5 June, the EU suggested that the budget be more  predictable and sustainable for future periods, and expressed  surprise over the distinction between Protocol and UNFCCC  activities in the budget. Australia emphasized that budget  priorities need to be clarified, and, with Brazil, China, the EU,  Japan, Norway, and the Russian Federation, said the budget  increase is too high. The Russian Federation said it favored a  zero-growth budget, but would accept budget increases for  inflation, and requested clear indication of how its contribution  to the budget would be affected by its ratification of the  Protocol.

At the first contact group meeting on Friday, 6 June, Chair Ashe  presented a draft COP-9 decision containing three options on the  draft budget and indicative scales of assessment that separated  financing for UNFCCC and Protocol activities to differing degrees.  The first option was based on an assumption that the UNFCCC budget  has two components and that Parties would adopt two scales at the  next COP; the second would approve a contingency budget for  Protocol activities at the next COP, and would approve Protocol  funding on an indicative scale, which would be activated after the  Protocol enters into force; and the third option would leave the  actual adoption of the Protocol budget and indicative scale to the  COP/MOP.

On Monday, 9 June, Chair Ashe presented a revised draft decision  and detailed breakdown of costs associated with Protocol  activities. Parties agreed on text that requests the Executive  Secretary to indicate the administrative and financial  implications, rather than actual costs, of proposed COP decisions.

Regarding a possible draft decision on adopting two indicative  scales of assessment, the EU said, if adopted, this decision would  set a negative precedent for other multilateral environmental  agreements (MEAs), since it would require Parties to pay for  selected activities related to a MEA, and offer a perverse  incentive for those Parties who have not yet ratified the Protocol.  Opposed by the US, the EU then proposed two new options, which  requested Parties to decide on only one instead of two indicative  scales. Under the first option, Parties would approve the budget  for the UNFCCC, including the preparatory activities related to  the Protocol, at the COP. Under the second option, Parties would  approve the budget for the UNFCCC at the COP, and adopt the budget  for preparatory activities relating to the Protocol at the COP/MOP.  The US proposed that Parties decide only on the biennial costs of  the UNFCCC, and not preparatory and operational costs associated  with the Protocol. The G-77/China, Argentina, and Brazil noted  that the new UN General Assembly scale of assessments should not  be applied automatically.

On Tuesday, 10 June, the EU and the US continued to disagree over  the issue of indicative scales. Honduras noted its concern about  the amount of funding budgeted for CDM activities. Chair Ashe  continued informal consultations on the budget in an attempt to  break the deadlock between the US and the EU.

On Friday, 13 June, Parties continued informal consultations  throughout the day, and agreed on draft conclusions and a draft  COP decision based on these consultations. The SBI then adopted  the draft conclusions on Friday evening.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the draft conclusions (FCCC/2003/SBI/L.14),  the SBI invites the Secretariat to inform Parties that COP-9 will  be requested to consider a total programme budget of 1) US$32.84  million; 2) US$35.79 million; or 3) any other amount. It also  proposes a contingency budget for conference servicing amounting  to US$5.96 million, in case the UN General Assembly decides not to  provide resources for these activities from the UN regular budget.  In addition, the SBI: requests the Executive Secretary to propose  a revised programme budget including a revised staffing table on  budget options 1 and 2; recommends a draft decision on the  programme budget for the biennium for further consideration at SB- 19; and notes the views expressed by some Parties on the use of  the UN scale of assessments, as a basis for the indicative scale  of contributions.

In the draft COP decision, contained in the annex of the  conclusions, the COP: notes the level of the working capital  reserve; authorizes the Executive Secretary to make limited  transfers between budget line items; and requests the Executive  Secretary to report on income and budget performance, and propose  any adjustments that might been needed in the biennial budget at  the next COP.

### IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEADQUARTERS AGREEMENT

In the SBI Plenary  on Monday, 4 June, Karsten Sach (Germany) indicated that the  German Government had recently agreed to support and accommodate  all Bonn-based UN agencies at one site. On Friday, 13 June, Chair  Stoycheva expressed appreciation for the implementation of the  headquarters agreement. She noted a meeting between UN  organizations and the German Government scheduled for the last  week of June.

# OTHER MATTERS

### THE USE OF GUIDELINES FOR THE PREPARATION OF NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL  COMMUNICATIONS

The report of the workshop on the use of  guidelines for the preparation of national communications from  non-Annex I Parties was addressed by the SBI on Friday, 6 June,  and again on Friday, 13 June. On Friday, 6 June, the G-77/China  and Tuvalu said the implementation of the guidelines will require  additional financial resources and capacity building, and, with  the EU, emphasized the need to focus on vulnerability and  adaptation, and greenhouse gas inventories. On Friday, 13 June,  Parties adopted draft conclusions prepared by Chair Stoycheva.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.11), the SBI  requests the Secretariat to develop, in consultation with the CGE,  a template to further facilitate the use of the UNFCCC guidelines  and the development of a website dedicated to disseminating  information on assistance provided by bilateral and multilateral  support programmes for the preparation of national communications.

### PROPOSAL BY CROATIA ON LULUCF AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF CROATIA  UNDER UNFCCC ARTICLE 4.6

The agenda items on the proposal by  Croatia on LULUCF and its special circumstances under UNFCCC  Article 4.6 (special circumstances of EITs) were considered  jointly, and addressed by the SBI on Wednesday, 4 June. The EU  encouraged Croatia to submit a consistent time series of emissions  data using consistent methodologies for 1990-2001. Bosnia and  Herzegovina, and Serbia and Montenegro opposed Croatia's  greenhouse gas emissions inventory adjustments for the 1990 base  year.

Following informal consultations facilitated by Jim Penman (UK),  on Friday, 13 June, the SBI adopted the draft conclusions on  LULUCF and on Article 4.6.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions on LULUCF (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.6),  the SBI notes the provision by Croatia of country-specific data  and information on its proposed forest management value. In the  conclusions on Article 4.6 (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.7), the SBI invites  Croatia to submit, by 30 September 2003, inventories of  anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all  greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol using  IPCC revised guidelines and UNFCCC guidelines on national  communications. It notes that the SBI will continue its  consideration of this issue at SBI-19.

# CLOSING PLENARY

Following a speech by Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter, a  number of Parties made statements of farewell to Deputy Executive  Secretary Tahar Hadj-Sadok, who is retiring.

The SBI then adopted the draft report of the session  (FCCC/SBI/2003/L.1), introduced by SBI Rapporteur Emily Ojoo- Massawa (Kenya). In her closing statement, Chair Stoycheva said  she had been invited by the SBSTA Chair to participate in SBSTA  expert group consultations on cross-cutting issues. On the  relationship between SBSTA and SBI expert groups, she noted that  requests for input by the groups will be channeled through the  respective subsidiary bodies. She thanked participants and  expressed hope that the rest of the world would recognize the work  completed at SB-18 as a reflection of the participants' sense of  global responsibility. She adjourned SBI-18 at 8:05 pm.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF SB-18 A VIEW FROM THE CROW'S NEST

Since the UNFCCC was adopted in 1992, negotiators have been busy  building a Protocol seaworthy enough to meet the challenge of  climate change. With Russia's ratification, it will set sail. This  brief analysis examines the significance of discussions at SB-18  within the context of the climate regime's development. In  particular, it questions whether this meeting has brought us  closer to the Protocol's launch by sending the right signals to  Moscow. It also assesses discussions relating to the regime's  seaworthiness, and the future course of the negotiations.

# SIGNALING MOSCOW

Since COP-6, the need to get Parties on board the Protocol has  been an underlying current in the negotiations. At the conclusion  of the Bonn Agreements, the lead EU negotiator said that 'to bring  the US on board, we first needed a boat. Now we have a boat.' But  at SB-18, Parties were not focused on when, or if the US might  ratify. Instead they were focused on when Russia would get on  board and launch the Protocol, since its ratification will trigger  entry into force. As a result, throughout the session, negotiators  speculated on the signals being sent to Moscow.

Negative signals emerged from discussions on many issues,  including those on the UNFCCC Secretariat's budget and  arrangements for meetings of the COP and COP/MOP. Reflecting its  unwillingness to participate in the Protocol's launch, the US  demanded that the budget be divided in two, so that contributions  to the Secretariat's budget from non-Parties to the Protocol would  not be used to fund Protocol activities. Although the US position  is understandable, dividing the budget could hinder the  Secretariat's operation, and create a distinct separation between  two complimentary legal instruments. More broadly, a divided  budget could undermine future work programmes and set a precedent  for other MEAs, as could the US insistence on separate  arrangements for meetings of the COP and COP/MOP.

On other issues, negative signals were sent about the regime's  long-term future. Annex I Parties floated proposals throughout SB- 18 with implications for developing country participation in the  second commitment period. Proposals on the Special Climate Change  Fund (SCCF), P&Ms and adverse effects, for instance, insisted on a  link between mitigation and adaptation. OPEC countries refused to  accept such a link, and blocked any indication of flexibility on  the part of developing countries particularly concerned about the  adverse effects of climate change. Some observers noted that  OPEC's arguments in this regard served other members of the G-77/China that are equally concerned about any emphasis on the need  for mitigation in developing countries.

SB-18 may not have sent a stream of positive signals to Moscow or  other Annex I Parties, but positive signs were perceptible in  discussions on several issues that relate to the regime's  effectiveness, and the future direction of negotiations.

# SEAWORTHINESS

How the international climate change regime fares once the  Protocol is launched will of course depend on the rules and  procedures governing the regime's implementation. Parties  continued to discuss several issues relating to the UNFCCC and  Protocol implementation at SB-18, including the SCCF, sinks in the  CDM and Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.

Given that the Protocol has not entered into force and discussions  on the Adaptation Fund are not yet on the horizon, non-Annex I  countries sought to ensure that adaptation activities would be  prioritized under the SCCF. Annex I countries, meanwhile, demanded  that the SCCF fund mitigation projects as well as adaptation  activities, arguing that early action in this regard would  strengthen the global response to climate change. While achieving  a compromise on this issue will be difficult, an outcome  satisfying both donor and recipient countries will facilitate non- Annex I Parties' role in the regime's journey.

The final task in operationalizing the CDM - deciding on  definitions and modalities for sinks projects - is another  important issue related to the participation of developing  countries in the climate regime. If the CDM is to enhance  sustainable development, a system of 'checks and balances' needs  to be designed that addresses issues like non-permanence and the  potential socioeconomic and environmental impacts of projects.  Regarding non-permanence, discussions at this session centered on  insurance versus temporary crediting approaches. At least one  Annex I Party and several Latin American countries would prefer  using insurance to guarantee the integrity of sinks projects for  at least ten years after the commitment period. Other countries,  including AOSIS, favor temporary crediting approaches that would  ensure that credits from sinks projects are ultimately replaced by  credits from emissions reductions. Parties clarified the options  for dealing with non-permanence, but did not agree on any text,  and found themselves similarly divided on the extent to which  socioeconomic and environmental impacts assessments should  influence project design and approval. How these and other issues  are resolved will, in the eyes of many observers, determine the  legitimacy of sinks projects undertaken in developing countries.

Compared to negotiations on the SCCF and sinks in the CDM, issues  relating to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8 were not particularly  contentious. Parties agreed to conclusions and unbracketed draft  COP and COP/MOP decisions relating to the training of Expert  Review Team (ERT) leaders, a code of conduct for ERT members, the  treatment of confidential information and adjustments to  greenhouse gas inventories. Once adopted, these decisions will  reinforce the functioning of two unique aspects of Protocol - the  market mechanisms and compliance system. In this regard, SB-18 has  prepared the Protocol for its upcoming launch.

# CHARTING A COURSE

Although Parties agree on the regime's ultimate objective, SB-18  provided an important opportunity for Parties to continue  discussions on several issues with the potential to affect the  regime's future direction. These included adverse effects, P&Ms  and the IPCC TAR.

Agreeing to a common course of action on adverse affects and on  P&Ms was not an easy task and Parties failed to reach substantive  conclusions. General differences in the perspectives of developed  and developing countries were only one reason for the lack of  progress. Another was the G-77/China's frequent inability to  develop and present unified positions.

Discussions on adverse effects began as expected, with developed  country Parties arguing that significant progress has been made in  addressing adverse effects, and developing countries arguing the  opposite. As discussions wore on, OPEC countries used their usual  tactic of insisting on the link between adaptation to climate  change and adaptation to response measures. Many observers  interpret OPEC's demand for compensation for the adverse effects  of response measures as akin to 'penalizing compliance' with  emissions mitigation commitments. Other developing countries  argued specifically for action regarding adaptation to climate  change, seemingly concerned that OPEC's tactic would prevent  progress and perpetuate the longstanding impasse on adverse  effects. Developed countries certainly continued to resist any  link between the two kinds of adverse effects, and were unwilling  to use the reports of recent workshops on these issues as a basis  for further action. As a consequence, the next steps on adaptation  remain obscure.

With respect to P&Ms, several Annex I Parties suggested that  information exchange could benefit all Parties, and facilitate  capacity building and technology transfer. Saudi Arabia, speaking  for the G-77/China, argued that text should not directly or  indirectly encourage non-Annex I Parties to share information.  However, at least one member of the G-77/China said that it did  not share Saudi Arabia's perspective.

Ultimately, negotiations broke down when Saudi Arabia, again on  behalf of the G-77/China, refused the EU and Japan's demand that a  sentence explicitly requiring information exchange on ways to  minimize the adverse effects of response measures be deleted. One  observer speculated that the US was largely silent on this matter  because it is not planning to implement policies and measures with  significant adverse effects. Parties agreed only to discuss P&Ms  again at SB-19, and although the Saudi Arabian delegate said he  looked forward to 'a new era of cooperation' on the issue, another  delegate described P&Ms as a 'dead end.' Discussions on next steps in the consideration of the IPCC TAR,  meanwhile, did result in substantive conclusions. Although  developing countries were united on this issue, for a while  developed countries were split on whether to address, at future  SBSTA sessions, aspects of mitigation and of adaptation as one or  two distinct agenda items. Developing countries were opposed to a  single agenda item, which would link the consideration of  adaptation and of mitigation, because they believe that mitigation  is the sole responsibility of Annex I Parties. Parties agreed a  delicate compromise to establish two new agenda items, but also to  take note of 'possible links' in future discussions. Annex I  Parties, including Russia, were reportedly satisfied, even though  it is not clearly specified that the possible links to be taken  note of refer to those between mitigation and adaptation.

# ON THE HORIZON

In the agreed conclusions at SB-18, Parties' expressed their  support for the World Conference on Climate Change (WCCC), which  will be held in Moscow in September, prior to COP-9. Some  observers suggest that support was not, however, as universal as  it appears in the text. Apparently, the EU may make its high-level  participation in the WCCC somewhat conditional on the steps Russia  takes towards ratification over the next few months. This direct  indication of the importance the EU places on Russia's  ratification will compliment some of the positive signals sent by  discussions at SB-18 on IPCC TAR and Articles 5, 7 and 8, and may  counteract some of the negative signals. In any event, while  Russia's ratification will allow the Protocol to enter into force,  it will by no means resolve outstanding issues relating to the  Protocol's seaworthiness and the regime's course. It seems clear  that the regime will soon be tested by the Protocol's  implementation and the review of demonstrable progress, with a  dialogue on developing country participation looming on the  horizon.
