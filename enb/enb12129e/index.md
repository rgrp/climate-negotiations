# INFORMAL MEETINGS AND WORKSHOPS

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

Chair Dovland summarized the outcome  of the FCCC workshop on policies and measures (P&Ms) held  during April in Copenhagen, and asked delegates for  suggestions on future work. While most delegates underlined  the continuing value of information exchange, there was  concern at the heavy workload prior to COP-6. The EU  proposed that additional workshops be held to address the  technical aspects of P&Ms and emphasized the need to  improve quantification of assessment of P&Ms at a sectoral  level. NIGERIA suggested organizing workshops to examine  the effect of P&Ms on developing countries, and proposed  that P&Ms be addressed as a cross-cutting issue with FCCC  Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects). Delegates proposed  that work be undertaken through Friends of the Chair rather  than a contact group.

JAPAN and the US doubted the value of using one set of  indicators to evaluate national policies. CANADA, with  AUSTRALIA, called for indicators that take into account  specific national circumstances. He preferred the concept  of 'good practices' to 'best practices' and, with the US,  highlighted the importance of completing national  inventories. The NETHERLANDS and FRANCE said reliance on  inventories alone was insufficient to evaluate the  effectiveness of P&Ms.

### GUIDELINES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates in  the subgroup on Article 5.1 (national systems) continued  discussing the second Draft Guidelines for National Systems  under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol and approved minor  changes on Other Definitions, General Functions and  Specific Functions. The US suggested using the same  definitions as those in the new IPCC report on Good  Practice Guidance. He said the guidelines should be  strictly limited to Article 5.1, and cautioned against  referring to reporting under Article 7 (communication of  information), which will be addressed separately. He added  that Specific Functions should be divided into inventory  planning, preparation and management. The EU highlighted  the need to include the establishment of quality objectives  in conjunction with Quality Control and Quality Assurance,  and for the consideration of recalculation in inventory  planning. With BULGARIA, she suggested distinguishing  between Quality Control and Quality Assurance, recognizing  the stronger obligation to implement the former.

The subgroup on Articles 5.2 (adjustments) and 8 (review of  information) continued its consideration of Part I of the  Elements of Draft Guidelines under Article 8 of the Kyoto  Protocol. On Objectives, SAUDI ARABIA sought the inclusion  of specific text relating to Article 3.2 (demonstrable  progress) and 3.14. (adverse effects). On General Approach,  delegates discussed the need to clarify the relationship  between the reports of Expert Review Teams (ERTs) and the  role of the COP/MOP and/or a compliance institution that  may be established. On Coverage, AUSTRALIA said the  Guidelines could be structured based on the timing of  information submitted, the Article under which the  information was submitted, or the type of issues reviewed.

On Timing and Procedures, the EU said the trial inventory  review period under the FCCC would provide useful guidance  for the proposed one-year time frame. Delegates also  discussed, inter alia: the need to clarify the actions and  information covered by the Secretariat's initial check; the  circumstances under which an in-country visit would take  place; whether recalculations of the base year emission  inventory could occur; and whether the Guidelines would be  self-contained. SWITZERLAND and the EU said the reports of  ERTs should also include questions identified and how they  had been handled. On Guidance for the ERTs, delegates  converged on the need for the Protocol's inventory review  guidelines to contain additional functions to the FCCC  guidelines, and for a single inventory review process under  the FCCC and the Protocol. On Classification of Inventory  Problems, the EU distributed a non-paper to help form the  rationale for problem categorization. On the Composition of  the ERTs, delegates underlined the need to discuss their  standing or ad hoc nature.

### MECHANISMS

Emissions Trading: Chair Chow highlighted key  features of emissions trading contained in the draft text  for negotiation. On participation, one option listed was to  require the Party's prior compliance with its obligations,  such as compliance with Articles 5 and 7 and maintenance of  national registries, while another option was to suspend  participation if the Party was not complying with these  obligations. On modalities of operations, proposals  included conducting transactions through bilateral and  multilateral arrangements among Annex I Parties, through an  exchange, or through both bilateral and multilateral  arrangements and exchanges. On liability, options presented  included seller liability, shared liability, buyer  liability, trigger, compliance reserve and post- verification proposals. SWITZERLAND, opposed by CANADA,  proposed an annual post-verification trading system,  wherein emissions trading would be limited to Assigned  Amount Units (AAU's) surplus to the Party's allocation  plan. With NEW ZEALAND and the US, CANADA supported a  seller regime complemented by an effective compliance  system. The US highlighted the need to maintain similar  approaches on Articles 4 (joint fulfillment of commitments)  and 17 (emissions trading), as both permit Parties to  fulfill obligations collectively, and pointed out that  Article 4 refers to transferor liability. TUVALU, on behalf  of AOSIS, highlighted the need for environmental integrity  of emissions trading systems and sought elaboration on the  idea of a compliance reserve. COLOMBIA stressed the need  for a suitable system for the measurement of emissions from  point and mobile sources. INDIA stressed the need to first  determine the character, nature and volume of the  transferable. He said that the CDM could be marginalized by  emissions trading because of its sustainable development  requirements.

Joint Implementation: Chair Chow sought delegates' views on  subjecting JI projects to CDM-type requirements. Noting the  different objectives of CDM and JI, JAPAN and POLAND argued  against additional requirements on JI. NEW ZEALAND, with  the US, argued that a JI project should be subject to CDM- type scrutiny only where a Party does not comply with  Articles 5 and 7, and where these both impact on the  project. The EU supported a CDM-type project cycle to  ensure environmental credibility at the project level.  NIGERIA expressed concern that different transaction costs  would reduce CDM take-up and, with INDIA and CHINA,  proposed similar requirements for JI.  SOUTH AFRICA argued  that JI's limitation to Annex I Parties does not justify  less onerous requirements. The US argued against imposing  CDM-type requirements just to ensure parity with JI.

Industry and environmental NGOs' positions: In an evening  session on business and NGO perspectives on the mechanisms,  representatives from the business community, including the  International Chamber of Commerce and the International  Climate Change Partnership, recommended, inter alia, that  COP-6: agree to clear definitions on fungibility and  tradeability; eschew quantitative restrictions in the  mechanisms; provide clarity on the proposed institutional  controls for CDM; create a strong and fair compliance  system; and approve mechanisms for fast-track CDM  crediting. Most representatives expressed preference for  seller liability.

The Climate Action Network (CAN), representing the NGOs,  said Annex-I participation in the mechanisms should hinge  on their ability to monitor and report emissions to a given  standard and track changes to AAUs. On liability, CAN  supported a hybrid buyer-seller liability ensuring  environmental effectiveness and capturing the market's  power to enhance compliance. On CDM, CAN said it must:  encourage the development of markets for clean energy  technologies in the South; support local, regional and  national development priorities; have minimum overall  environmental impacts; and not undermine Annex I domestic  action. CAN also suggested measures to enhance public  participation in the CDM Project Cycle.

### CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES

Chair Dovland said this meeting was  aimed at facilitating coherence and eliminating duplication  of work among the various issues under negotiation. He  noted linkages between the work on mechanisms, compliance  and Articles 5, 7 and 8, and suggested grouping these  cross-cutting issues in seven areas: supplementary  information relating to the mechanisms; the review of  mechanisms-related activities; the relationship between the  adjustment and compliance procedures; the relationship  between the classification of problems and the screening  procedure; implementation issues; and criteria for  mechanisms participation. He then listed 14 specific  questions related to these cross-cutting issues and  identified which of the three contact groups should take  the lead role in responding to each of these questions. He  noted that further questions could be added to this list,  and that there were linkages between other issues under  negotiation, such as the potential linkages between work on  P&Ms and FCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and Protocol Article  3.14.

On additional cross-cutting issues, SAUDI ARABIA asked  about, inter alia: the relationship between the financial  penalty under the compliance regime and Protocol Articles  2.3 and 3.14; the relationship between the compliance  mechanism and Articles 5 and 7; and whether an Annex I  Party might lose its eligibility to participate in the  mechanisms if in non-compliance with other Articles. GHANA  stressed that provisions under Article 12 (CDM) should not  be seen to replace those under FCCC Article 4.5 (technology  transfer), 4.8 and 4.9. The US raised questions about the  relationship between Article 4 (joint fulfillment of  commitments) and Articles 5, 7 and 8, the mechanisms and  the compliance regime. The EU asked about the implications  of different options relating to liability for reporting  and review under the compliance system. He said  consideration of the linkage between Articles 7 and 8 on  the one hand, and Articles 6 and 12 on the other, should be  extended to Article 17.

### LAND USE, LAND-USE CHANGE AND FORESTRY

Delegates were  updated on the progress of the contact group charged with  compiling the proposals for a data-reporting format. On  guiding principles and criteria for the identification of  additional activities under Article 3.4 (changes in carbon  stocks), Co-Chair Philip Gwage (Uganda) underscored the  need for consistency with the FCCC objective, and said  sequestration is not comparable with emissions reductions.  The EU said criteria should be verifiable and take into  account the objective of sustainable development. She said  carbon stock change should be attributable to human-induced  activities. AUSTRALIA said attention should be paid to the  use of the criteria before considering the nature and scope  of guiding principles.

The US proposed starting with the issues identified in FCCC  Article 3.4. He stressed the need for comprehensiveness to  ensure that the maximum incentive is given to Parties to  reduce emissions and enhance sequestration, and said  measures undertaken should be cost effective. CANADA  underscored the importance of emphasizing the national  context of sustainable development, while TUVALU stressed a  broader approach.

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson said a list of guiding principles and  criteria could provide a context for country submissions.  He suggested separating guiding principles and criteria.  AUSTRALIA cautioned against differentiating between guiding  principles and criteria, recalling similar earlier  discussions that had not resulted in agreement. Supported  by the US, she said the guiding principles for additional  activities under Article 3.4 already exist in the FCCC and  Protocol, and questioned the need for a list. The co-chairs  will compile the discussions for consideration at the next  informal meeting.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some participants felt the session on cross-cutting issues  represented a barometer for the meeting so far, which seems  to have started constructively.
