# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Delegates considered and adopted, with minor amendments,  the Report of the JWG on its work during SB-12. Annexed to  the report is a text on compliance that, along with inputs  from Parties, will serve as the basis for negotiation at  SB-13.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### MECHANISMS

Delegates continued considering the Chair's  draft consolidated text on mechanisms, indicating areas  where their submissions had not been reflected, and adding  text where necessary. On the CDM, delegates differed on the  need for, inter alia: all three mechanisms to contribute to  the adaptation fund; investment and technology  additionality; monitoring of economic, social and cultural  impacts of projects; and an option that reflects the  various proposed CDMs, including unilateral, bilateral and  multilateral. They discussed: the role of the COP/MOP and  the Executive Board; the content and extensiveness of the  CDM Reference Manual; common baselines for the CDM;  equitable distribution of CDM projects; and requirements  and costs of the CDM.

On emissions trading, delegates differed on the need for,  inter alia: the usage of the Protocol-consistent term 'Part  of an Assigned Amount' instead of 'Assigned Amount Units';  legal entities to participate in the CDM; a share of  proceeds from emissions trading to fund adaptation; and  limits on transfers. The group accepted draft conclusions  for SBSTA/SBI agreeing to forward the 'consolidated text on  principles, modalities, rules and guidelines' to SB-13 as a  basis for further negotiation.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

The group continued consideration of the  six parts of the Co-Chairs' Proposed Elements of Draft  Guidelines under Article 8 of the Kyoto Protocol, starting  with the General Approach to Review. The US stated that  there could be overlap between annual reviews, since the  process might take more than a year. NEW ZEALAND said the  text should specify to whom the final compilation and  accounting would be reported/transmitted. The EU suggested  an additional option that the pre-commitment reviews could  be initiated when a Party makes a voluntary submission  within a mandatory deadline. AUSTRALIA said the review of  national registries could occur more frequently than on an  annual basis. SWITZERLAND said the guidelines should  establish criteria for the selection of experts not  nominated by governments.

On Review of National Inventory Submissions, delegates  discussed the categories of first-order problems to be  identified during the initial check or during the  individual inventory review stage. The US and AUSTRALIA  suggested that methodological problems be identified during  the inventory review stage. The EU stressed that these  problems, such as 'unexplained apparent data  inconsistencies,' could be identified during the initial  check. The US said the lateness of a submission should be  defined and distinguished from the failure to submit. The  EU said the trial period would help in achieving a better  understanding of potential inventory problems.

On procedures for adjustments, JAPAN suggested adding the  option whereby the Party itself could voluntarily apply an  adjustment. AUSTRALIA said this could accelerate the review  process. The US said the incentive should rather be for  Parties to follow the IPCC methodologies as elaborated by  good practice. NORWAY said the Expert Review Team (ERT)  would only propose an adjustment, while the compliance body  would adopt it. The US said the compliance body had a role  if the Party concerned refused a recommended adjustment.

On the Review of Information on Assigned Amounts, NEW  ZEALAND sought a reference to Article 4 (joint fulfillment)  to ensure transparency on the distribution of assigned  amounts between members of the agreement. AUSTRALIA called  for the addition of a new Part VI 'Review of Activities  under Article 6.'

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Salamat asked delegates to  consider the process leading to COP-6, and noted that an  informal consultation may be held on this issue during the  intersessional period prior to the informal meetings  preceding SB-13. The G-77/CHINA supported the development  of text for discussion at the informal meetings prior to  SB-13 and noted that, under the Buenos Aires Plan of  Action, COP-6 needs to develop initial actions rather than  simply a process. SAUDI ARABIA supported the need for  further workshops focusing on concrete actions. The US  stressed that the objective of this process was to promote  the prospects of ratifying the Protocol. He said progress  was needed at SB-13 on negotiating draft decisions.

Co-Chair Salamat said discussions during the past two weeks  had been very productive. He distributed text for relevant  SB-12 draft conclusions that, inter alia, note that the  Chairs of the subsidiary bodies, with the assistance of the  Secretariat, will develop a text based on the current  consolidated text, on other inputs from Parties, and on  comments made during the discussions at SB-12. The  conclusions also note that the Chairs' text will serve as  the basis for negotiation at SB-13. The group adopted these  conclusions.

### LULUCF

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson noted that the draft  conclusions had been completed after additional  consultations in the morning. On criteria and guiding  principles, Parties had agreed to request indication of how  the additional activities proposed by Parties in their 1  August submissions would relate to the objectives and  principles of the FCCC and Kyoto Protocol. They had also  reached agreement on the elements for a synthesis of  textual proposals from their 1 August submissions, which  they requested the Secretariat to prepare. The Co-Chair  noted an additional conclusion highlighting the fact that  documents for the next session would be available only at a  late date, and urged Parties to accelerate their  consideration of the issue. SAUDI ARABIA highlighted the  tight schedule for an intersessional consultation, while  ITALY offered to host this meeting in Rome. The Secretariat  and POLAND provided details on the workshop to be held in  July in Poznan, Poland, and the Secretariat outlined the  process for the 1 August submissions.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

In an informal meeting chaired by  Jos√© Romero (Switzerland), delegates considered revised  draft conclusions on policies and measures (P&Ms). During  the deliberations, the EU and JUSCANZ members reiterated  their respective positions on the timing and nature of  further activities on P&Ms. Participants agreed to replace  text recommending that the work on P&Ms continue, in  particular through a workshop in 2001, with the  recommendation that the issue be considered further at  SBSTA-13. The text proposed by the EU and G-77/CHINA on  Terms of Reference for a workshop on P&Ms was not adopted.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Delegates discussed capacity building  both in countries with economies in transition (EITs) and  in developing countries. On capacity building in EITs,  delegates considered submissions from the Russian  Federation and Poland. The Polish submission focused on  elements relating to implementation of capacity building.  It includes calls for, inter alia: developing action plans  to reflect national needs and priorities; inviting the GEF,  through a COP decision, to consider the needs of EITs in  the Capacity Development Initiative (CDI); and organizing a  workshop for the purpose of identifying and coordinating  regional and subregional programmes. The Russian Federation  submission covered the principles, objectives, strategy and  implementation elements for a draft framework. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION noted that there was agreement among the EITs on  the principles and scope of the framework, but stated that  consultations to complete an EIT group submission were  ongoing.

Delegates also considered the revised Chair's text on  capacity building in non-Annex I countries. Several  participants reiterated the need for capacity building to  be country-driven, iterative and long-term, to build on  indigenous capacities, and to operate through local  institutions. The US and the EU proposed listing a menu of  activities, noting that different countries have different  concerns.

The G-77/CHINA proposed additional amendments to the  Chair's text that stress the need for: capacity building to  contribute to sustainable development; partnership with,  and assistance from, developed countries; and proper  guidance from intergovernmental organizations, such as the  GEF, UNDP, and World Bank, to ensure that access to  resources is transparent, with clear and less cumbersome  procedures. Supported by CHINA, he urged moving forward  toward concrete actions by COP-6. UGANDA sought  clarification of what is meant by 'centers of excellence,'  noting that this could be interpreted differently. The US  stressed that capacity building should be results-based and  designed to produce clearly identified results. The EU  suggested inviting the GEF and UNDP to report on the CDI at  SB-13 and requesting other organizations to report on their  capacity building activities. Chair Ashe welcomed further  submissions by 30 June, after which the Secretariat would  prepare a draft framework on capacity building.

# SBSTA

Delegates adopted, without discussion, draft conclusions  on: Guidelines under Articles 5, 7 and 8 of the Kyoto  Protocol, which included an Annex on Guidelines for  National Systems for the Estimation of Anthropogenic  Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Sources and Removal by Sinks  under Article 5.1 of the Kyoto Protocol  (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/L.2); Development and Transfer of  Technologies - Status of the Consultative Process (Decision  4/CP.4); and Development and Transfer of Technologies -  Other Matters (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/L.4).

After some deliberation, the Draft Conclusions on Good  Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National  Greenhouse Gas Inventories (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/L.3) were  adopted, with two amendments: Annex I Parties with EITs may  phase-in good practice guidance 'two years,' rather than  one year, later than other Annex I Parties; and reference  to 'all Parties' being assisted by good practice guidance  in preparing higher-quality greenhouse gas inventories was  deleted.

On the Draft Conclusions on Land Use, Land-Use Change and  Forestry, SAUDI ARABIA, opposed by a number of Parties,  including TUVALU speaking for the G-77/CHINA, proposed  deleting text on convening an intersessional consultation  on LULUCF after SBSTA-13. The text was retained and the  conclusions were adopted with an Annex providing formats  for the submission of country-specific data on proposals by  Annex I Parties for activities related to Protocol Article  3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and  Article 3.4 (additional activities). ITALY offered to host  the intersessional consultation, suggesting it take place  in October.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some participants have said they will be watching with  interest the upcoming meeting of the EU Council of  Ministers for clearer indications of the Union's  negotiating positions on some of the key issues raised at  SB-12. Several observers have expressed frustration at the  EU's performance during the SB-12 discussions, noting an  apparent setback on policies and measures and a lack of  coherence, which contrasts with that of the Umbrella Group.  Others have suggested that any perceived loss of ground at  this stage in the negotiating process is overstated, and  that a verdict on the Union's performance is premature  prior to the Ministerial meeting, which will take important  decisions such as those on sinks and nuclear power.
