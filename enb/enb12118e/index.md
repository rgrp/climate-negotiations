# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Espen RÃ¸nneberg (Marshall Islands) said the JWG had to  report on its progress to COP-5 and request the COP to take  further steps including, if necessary, the establishment of an ad  hoc working group on compliance. He said consultations had  revealed that the JWG should continue its work until COP-6. He  presented the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions, as well as a draft  decision on the future work of the JWG.

The draft conclusions state that, inter alia: much work needs to  be done and the JWG must move progressively toward negotiation;  the Co-Chairs should further develop the elements of a compliance  procedure, incorporating Parties' proposals; and this paper will  receive Parties' full consideration at SB-12 and serve as a basis  for negotiation. Several delegates said the draft conclusions  provided a useful text to work on. SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA, the US,  NIGERIA and BRAZIL said the paper developed by the Co-Chairs  should be based on more sources of information. Delegates  suggested that additional sources of information could be drawn  from existing and further submissions by Parties, as well as  discussions held during the session of the JWG and during a  possible forthcoming workshop. CHINA, IRAN and SAUDI ARABIA,  opposed by the EU and AUSTRALIA, suggested that the paper serve as  a basis for 'consideration' of compliance. NIGERIA added that  nothing in the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) required the JWG  to finish its work by COP-6. The UK, opposed by the US, proposed  that the paper serve as 'the' basis for negotiations on compliance  at the next session of the JWG.

The operative paragraphs of the draft decision on the future work  of the JWG on compliance requires the JWG to 'continue its work'  beyond COP-5 and 'complete its work' before COP-6. NEW ZEALAND,  with AUSTRALIA, ARGENTINA, the US, the EU, BAHAMAS, CHILE and the  FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA, sought to retain the phrase  'complete its work,' as Parties had a responsibility to achieve  the objectives of the BAPA and it would be difficult to justify a  less ambitious goal. CHINA, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA sought  alternative language supporting substantial progress by COP-6. A  revised Co-Chairs' draft conclusions and decision based on  Parties' suggestions will be available on Monday.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### AIJ

Chair de Boer (Netherlands) introduced draft conclusions on  'learning by doing' and capacity building, geographic  distribution, and additional project incentives. He reported  contact with regional co-ordinators and invited Parties to  commence a paragraph-by-paragraph reading of his draft decision. A  preambular paragraph was amended to specify that AIJ under the  pilot phase are undertaken within the FCCC framework. Two  preambular paragraphs were merged after discussion on geographic  distribution. The new paragraph acknowledges the importance of  'learning by doing' under the pilot phase and of providing new AIJ  opportunities to Parties that have not experienced them. On the  paragraph on continuation of AIJ, the Chair noted Parties'  interest in what will happen under the mechanisms. His draft  compromise text, placed in brackets, records a decision by the  Parties to conclude the review process and, without prejudice to  future decisions regarding project eligibility, continue the AIJ  pilot phase.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Salamat (Iran) presented the Co-Chairs'  draft decision on the implementation of FCCC Articles 4.8 and 4.9.  He outlined the text's operative paragraphs, including: a process  to address information gathering; the convening of two distinct  workshops on the effects of climate change and response measures;  examination of actions relating to funding, insurance and the  transfer of technology; and a request to the subsidiary bodies to  continue consideration of these Articles. Delegates discussed the  preambular paragraphs and agreed to introduce a new paragraph  'acknowledging the efforts already made by country Parties towards  meeting the specific needs and concerns of developing country  Parties, in particular least developing countries, with regard to  adaptation.' The Co-Chairs will present a clean preambular text on  Monday.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

This joint contact group concluded its  work and agreed to forward the following documents, as amended, to  the relevant subsidiary bodie: SBI draft conclusions and a draft  decision and annex on guidelines for the technical review of  greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories from Annex I Parties; SBSTA draft  conclusions and a draft decision; Part II of the guidelines on  national communications; and FCCC reporting guidelines on global  climate observing systems.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

This contact group continued consideration of  the Co-Chairs' proposal for a draft decision on capacity building.  The group worked through the operative paragraphs and discussed,  inter alia: how financial and technical capacity building should  be provided; whether to have a comprehensive assessment of  capacity building activities to determine their effectiveness,  gaps and weaknesses; and whether to elaborate on  activities to  support national capacity-building activities for FCCC  implementation or on the particulars for a comprehensive  assessment. They bracketed a number of paragraphs and agreed to  reconvene in a Friends of the Chairs' meeting on Monday to draft  the proposal for a decision.

### LULUCF

Co-Chairs Thorgeirsson (Iceland) and Gwage (Uganda)  informed the group of a draft decision they had prepared on  LULUCF-related methodological issues, including aspects relating  to submissions by Parties on: definitions and activities on  Protocol Article 3.3 (net changes in emissions and removals); a  list of activities that each individual Party is seeking to  include under Article 3.4 (additional human-induced activities  relating to changes in emissions and removals); views on possible  modalities, rules and guidelines on additional activities under  Protocol Article 3.4; and a request for the Secretariat to compile  a list of guiding principles and criteria for the identification  and selection of additional activities under Article 3.4. The G-77/CHINA said it had prepared a draft decision covering similar  aspects and including others such as guidance on the scope of the  workshop on the IPCC Special Report. Many delegations noted  similarities between the two texts, and agreed to follow the  sequencing of paragraphs in the G-77/CHINA proposal as a basis for  discussions. The group read through the text and established a  drafting group to work on it. Differing views focused on, inter  alia: the sequence of activities in the lead-up to SBSTA-12 and  how they interrelate; presentation and transmission of the IPCC  Special Report to SBSTA-12; timing for submissions and  consideration of criteria and guiding principles for data on  additional activities; timing for submissions and proposals for  definitions on activities under Article 3.3; and timing for and  types of country-specific data. The contact group reconvened to  consider progress made by the drafting group, working late into  the night.

### MECHANISMS

Delegates considered the project cycle of the CDM. The  G-77/CHINA stressed the need to address the CDM's driving force,  nature and scope. AUSTRALIA said the CDM should be largely private  sector driven. He added that investors needed to know that credits  will be forthcoming.

Several Parties agreed that the host country is the best judge of  its sustainable development needs. NORWAY inquired about the role  of operational entities in the validation and pre-registration of  project proposals, noting that the Executive Board may not be able  to carry out this task.

SOUTH AFRICA, the SUDAN, BOLIVIA, MEXICO and MAURITANIA suggested  that the CDM include the concept of emissions avoidance. BOLIVIA  proposed including forest protection initiatives under emissions  avoidance. MEXICO said he looked forward to using the CDM to  supplement national efforts to shift from slash-and-burn  techniques, which are responsible for loss of forest cover, to  sustainable technologies that would have a positive impact on  climate change. MAURITANIA objected to the inclusion of forest  protection within the CDM, as Parties would seek to protect their  forests regardless of its inclusion. IRAN said the CDM should  include projects related to both sinks and sources. On the issue  of baselines for emissions avoidance projects, NEW ZEALAND  suggested that, to minimize transaction costs, the commercial  contract-bidding process should be used to identify the baseline.  The EU said the baselines should be determined on a project-by- project basis.

SWITZERLAND said that in considering the types of projects that  are eligible, possible negative spillover effects into other  multilateral domains should be taken into consideration. MOROCCO  stressed the need to certify that reduced or avoided emissions are  real, measurable and contribute to sustainable development in the  host country. With SWITZERLAND, she said CDM projects should be  subjected to rigorous impact assessment studies that take into  account the socio-economic aspects of the host country.

On the financing of CDM projects, Chair Chow (Malaysia) queried  whether the funding will be bilateral, multilateral or unilateral;  if ODA and the FCCC's financial mechanisms could fund CDM  activities; or if CDM funds will be managed by the Executive  Board, so as to ensure equitable distribution. MAURITANIA asked  how transparency of and accountability for the investment will be  ensured.

On unilateral funding of CDM projects, JAPAN asked whether  unilaterally-funded projects were consistent with the concept of  CDM. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said unilateral funding for CDM would  provide incentives for non-Annex I Parties to implement measures  to reduce GHGs. COLOMBIA highlighted the potential of indigenous  private sector projects. He said that as long as CDM projects  demonstrate additionality and lead to real and measurable long- term reductions, there should be flexibility in financing the  projects. On unilateral CDM, NEW ZEALAND noted that additionality  would require careful judgments.

Regarding the use of ODA and GEF funds, the EU said CDM funding  should not compete with these sources but that we would be open to  discussion of all options as long as conditions for validation and  certification are met. The G-77/CHINA emphasized that CDM funding  should be over and above ODA, GEF and other financial commitments.  JAPAN said there were no provisions requiring financial  additionality and none that preclude the use of ODA as a source of  funding. He said the CDM should be mainly funded by the private  sector. The G-77/CHINA said funding additionality flows from the  fact that the purpose of the CDM is to assist Annex I Parties in  attaining their commitments

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Chair El Ghaouth (Mauritania)  suggested that work on a draft decision on matters related to the  consideration of non-Annex I communications continue in the  drafting group. The G-77/CHINA said it was clear from the  agreement at COP-4 that second national communications would be  funded without further guidelines. El Ghaouth said the costs  related to this draft decision would be met by extra budgetary  sources. He added that SBI would consider on Monday the decision  currently being discussed in the drafting group, the issue of the  contingency budget for non-Annex I communications, and a decision  on the compilation and synthesis of initial communications.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

A draft decision being prepared by developing countries has  stirred some concern in the corridors. The draft proposal would  limit the decision on capacity building to climate change  considerations. Supporters of an all-encompassing approach to  capacity building argue that their approach would be cost  effective and more consistent with the associated benefits of  sustainable development. However, those in support of focusing  capacity building on climate change stress that it must follow the  mandate of the FCCC if the limited pot of funding is to be used  effectively and produce tangible results. They say decisions on  comprehensive capacity building must await a maturing of linkages  across Convention institutions.
