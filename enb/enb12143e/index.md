# INFORMAL MEETINGS

### POLICIES AND MEASURES

After outlining recent developments  on P&Ms, Chair Jose Romero (Switzerland) requested Parties  to focus on developing a decision for COP-6. The EU  proposed objectives relating to: information exchange and  experience; facilitating cooperation between Parties; and  facilitating assessment of demonstrable progress. CANADA  asked whether facilitating cooperation would be a  bilateral, trilateral or multilateral exercise. The US and  AUSTRALIA said countries could demonstrate progress through  institutional and legal steps taken to achieve Protocol  Article 3.1 commitments, while JAPAN suggested the  assessment be based on national communications. The  MARSHALL ISLANDS, for AOSIS, stressed the need for Annex I  Parties to take domestic action through P&Ms, while  ZIMBABWE highlighted their impact on developing countries.

On text for a COP-6 decision, the EU emphasized the need  for a 'continuous and structured process' to address the  issues within its proposed objectives. SWITZERLAND, with  AOSIS, supported using the EU proposal as the basis for the  COP-6 decision. TANZANIA sought clarity on the need for a  separate reporting system for demonstrable progress, and  proposed specifying timeframes for information exchange.  PERU underlined cost implications associated with best  practices. Draft elements for decision will be available  Thursday morning.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Co-Chairs Dean Cooper (Canada) and  Dapo Afolabi (Nigeria) invited SBSTA Chair Dovland to  present results from the Friends of the Chair consultations  on development and transfer of technology held in Colorado,  USA, which are contained in a non-paper. He highlighted the  five key themes identified at SBSTA-12: technology needs  and needs assessment, technology information, enabling  environments, capacity building and mechanisms for  technology transfer. The US stressed, inter alia, the role  of the private sector and the importance of holistic,  bottom-up approaches. SAUDI ARABIA said technology transfer  required adequate funds and called for an annual financial  commitment by donor countries.

On the question of who will drive the process, UGANDA  underscored the role of governments. HONDURAS urged  consideration of the role of existing organizations,  especially those involved in higher education. The  PHILIPPINES expressed concern that discussions still  revolved around assessing needs and suggested renewing the  discussions from COP-1 to establish an intergovernmental  advisory panel on technology with equitable geographic  representation.

### LULUCF

Participants considered Parties' submissions on  LULUCF contained in a consolidated synthesis document  prepared by the Secretariat. On the definition of 'forest,'  the EU favored the FAO definition, with limited flexibility  to consider national circumstances. JAPAN and CANADA  supported flexibility and said definitions used should be  clearly and transparently reported. TUVALU called for a  universal definition of forest, cautioning against too much  flexibility. The US outlined a compromise following the  general structure of the FAO definition, with flexibility  regarding key parameters, where Parties would choose a  single value from a range of accepted values.

On the definitions on afforestation, reforestation and  deforestation (ARD), JAPAN highlighted the FAO activity- based approach, with the harvest-regeneration cycle  included under reforestation. AUSTRALIA highlighted its  suggested distinction between degradation and  deforestation. CANADA suggested aggradation-degradation be  included under Article 3.4. The US said Article 3.3 and 3.4  definitions should be considered as a package.

On accounting, INDIA stressed the difficulties inherent in  differentiating between indirect and direct human-induced  activities. The EU supported reporting on, but not  accounting for, non-CO2 greenhouse gases. AUSTRALIA  highlighted proposed sub-rules to overcome perverse  incentives for deforestation prior to the first commitment  period. JAPAN said Parties should be able to account for  stock changes in all carbon pools, but should decide  themselves which pools to include.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

SBI Chair John Ashe said the meeting's  aim was to discuss the conclusions of the capacity  development initiative (CDI) regional reviews.

Regional group meetings: Following an introduction to the  CDI regional assessments, smaller groups were convened to  discuss reports of the regional reviews.

The group of Small Island Developing States considered ways  to take the process forward. Participants noted that it  would take a number of years to establish CDI activities  and that interim actions could be taken at the regional  level to address immediate needs already identified.

The Asia-Pacific meeting discussed the report's focus on  the need to, inter alia: strengthen existing networks of  regional and national experts and institutions offering  training; broaden the base of participation and action;  consider specific social and cultural context in technology  transfer; and ensure that capacity development is country- driven.

Participants in the African meeting expressed concern with  the process of developing the regional reviews, and called  for more time to consider the report. Questions raised  included whether the questionnaire was based on GEF  guidelines or on the different COP decisions, and if there  has been an assessment of the response costs.

The Eastern Europe and Central Asia group highlighted,  inter alia, a short-term project-based and long-term  systematic approach to capacity building, and regional  diversity.

Participants in the group for Latin America and the  Caribbean emphasized the lack of negotiating capacity,  which is affected by rapid rotation of diplomatic staff,  and the need for financial resources for countries to  manage their own capacity-building priorities. They also  stressed the need to improve interaction between the GEF  and national focal points.

### COMPLIANCE

Following a report by Co-Chair Dovland on the  informal consultations held in Iceland on 18-20 July 2000,  Parties discussed the structure of a compliance body. The  EU expressed its preference for: one body with two  branches; a powerful Chair; enforcement measures applying  only to Annex I countries; and facilitative measures  applying to the obligations of all Parties. SOUTH AFRICA,  for the G-77/CHINA, noted her preference for one body with  two branches subject to certain conditions, including that:  the enforcement branch apply only to Annex I countries; the  composition of both branches reflect geographic  distribution; and the branches have clearly delineated  mandates. With the US, she underlined the need for  certainty and due process, and with the RUSSIAN FEDERATION  opposed the EU proposal for a powerful Chair. The US  accepted the proposed structure of one body with two  branches and underlined the US focus on commitments rather  than on Parties. BRAZIL noted that this could co-exist with  a clear statement that non-Annex I Parties did not have  commitments. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION and JAPAN, opposed by  SAMOA, preferred consecutive rather than parallel  functions, with the facilitative stage preceding  enforcement.

The EU proposed that the compliance body comprise a  technical team for facilitation and a legal team for  enforcement. JAPAN, the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, BRAZIL and  SWITZERLAND opposed this division. SWITZERLAND proposed a  single body performing both functions but with a screening  panel that would determine the procedure to be followed in  each case. SAUDI ARABIA suggested that a modified  multilateral consultative process serve as a facilitative  body in this structure.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Bo Kjellén (Sweden) introduced  the Co-Chairs' text intended to be used as a basis for COP- 6 negotiating text. ZIMBABWE, for the G-77/CHINA, called  for two draft decisions, one relating to FCCC Article 4.8  and 4.9, and the other to Protocol Article 3.14. The EU,  with the US, preferred taking one decision on both. On the  Co-Chairs' text, the EU suggested removing the section on  Protocol Article 3.14, and integrating it into the sections  on adverse effects and the impact of response measures.

UGANDA, the GAMBIA, NEPAL, BURKINA FASO, the US and others  said the needs and concerns of least developed countries  should be clearly articulated in the text and in decisions.  Co-Chair Kjellén noted participants' support for using the  Co-Chairs' text as the basis for negotiations.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Participants considered  elements of draft guidelines under Article 7. SAUDI ARABIA  underscored that the G-77/CHINA needed more time to  consider the guidelines. Parties agreed on the EU proposal  to add separate headings on guidelines for reporting of  supplementary information under Article 7.1 and 7.2. On  Reporting of Information under Article 7.1, delegates  bracketed language related to timeframes for reporting. NEW  ZEALAND drew attention to cross-cutting elements between  the guidelines and ongoing work in the LULUCF group. Co- Chair Plume, supported by AUSTRALIA, noted the need to move  forward on the elements without pre-empting the work of the  other groups. Stressing the amount of work under Articles  5, 7, and 8, Co-Chair Plume suggested creating a small  group to progress work on the guidelines under Article 8.  Delegates agreed to work only on Part II of the guidelines,  which will be presented to the larger group on Friday.

### MECHANISMS

Chair Chow presented the institutional issues  relating to the CDM. He outlined, inter alia: the  responsibilities and authorities of COP/MOP and the  Executive Board (EB) as set out in Protocol Article 12  (CDM); the tasks and functions of the EB relating to the  accreditation of operational entities, registration of  projects, the reference manual, and issuance of CERs; the  tasks and functions of COP/MOP; and the rules of procedure  of the EB. On the role of the COP/MOP, SOUTH AFRICA,  supported by SAMOA, identified an overlap in the functions  assigned to the COP/MOP, the EB and the compliance body.  She cautioned against creating a situation that could lead  to forum shopping. INDIA pointed out that in the Chair's  presentation 'the EBs had gained and the COP/MOP and  Operational Entities had lost.' He suggested reconsidering  the balance and bringing out linkages. SAMOA, supported by  the EU, reminded Parties of the agreement at Kyoto that the  COP/MOP would not deal with routine CDM concerns. With the  US, she stressed the need for technical expertise in the  EB. The EU envisaged a variety of functions for the EB,  including: issuing CERs; project registration; and issues  related to accreditation of Operational Entities. The  REPUBLIC OF KOREA said that without a clear idea of the  nature of the CDM and the number of expected projects, it  would be impossible to elaborate on the EB. NORWAY  responded that the structure of the CDM would influence the  volume of CDM projects. CHINA, supported by JAPAN and  AUSTRALIA, said Parties, not the EB, could determine  criteria to determine contribution to sustainable  development.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some participants have expressed concern at the apparent  lack of urgency for making substantial progress on Articles  5, 7 and 8. Given the heavy workload facing this group,  observers warn that a lack of movement in working through  remaining text could prove problematic later on.
