# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### MECHANISMS

In a morning meeting of this contact group, Chair Chow  said revised text based on the week's 'informal informal'  discussions would form the basis for the impending ministerial  negotiations. The G-77/CHINA reported that it had just completed  deliberations on the decision portion of the CDM text, and urged  that the results of these deliberations be reflected in the  revised text. Following consultations with the Chairs of SBSTA and  SBI, the contact group was adjourned to allow consultation within  the Friends of the Chair group.

When the contact group reconvened mid-afternoon, Chair Chow  reported that progress had been made, particularly with the  decision sections of the text. He said details of the discussion  would be given in the joint SBI/SBSTA session later that day.  SAUDI ARABIA expressed concern that some of its comments relating  to compliance and participation were not adequately reflected in  this revised text. Various delegations thanked Chair Chow for his  leadership in managing this three-year process, and the contact  group was closed.

### FINANCIAL ISSUES

The financial issues group mandated by COP-6  President Pronk met briefly in the morning to discuss the Co- Chairs' text drawing together elements of draft decisions on  establishment of new funds being discussed in contact groups on  capacity building, adverse effects and technology transfer. Co- Chair Ashe stated that given the short time remaining for  discussions, it was unlikely much could be accomplished.

The PHILIPPINES, speaking for the G-77/CHINA, rejected this  procedure to consider these financial issues outside their  relevant contact groups, stating that it was neither transparent  nor democratic. She added that delaying tactics by the US and  other developed countries for obstructing progress had become  evident. The EU stressed its ongoing efforts to encourage progress  and a willingness and openness to discuss further relevant issues  outside this meeting. The US, with CANADA, also expressed  frustration at the rate of progress, and indicated support for  continuing work towards resolving the G-77/China's concern about  the situation. The NETHERLANDS stressed the role of transparency  and democracy in upholding the intergovernmental character of the  process, and the importance of partnership for progress to take  place. Co-Chair Ashe said he would refer the statements to  President Pronk, and closed the meeting.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates convened in the morning for  the last meeting of this contact group and heard a summary by Co- Chair Plume on how the text had been advanced in the Friends of  the Chairs group. She said the group had met throughout the  previous night and that the revised working paper, largely free of  brackets, had been completed at 5.30 am on Saturday. She said many  of the remaining brackets are for editorial reasons, some brackets  relate to issues where the technical content of the guidelines  could not be developed without having received information from  other contact groups, and a third set of brackets relate to issues  of a political nature spanning the entire negotiating process that  might be resolved in the coming week. Delegates then made  editorial changes, as well as a number of drafting proposals to be  reflected in the text to be considered by SBSTA later in the day.  Co-Chair Plume concluded the meeting by saying that further work  on the guidelines would be undertaken, in one form or the other,  during the following week.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

In this contact group, Co- Chair Cooper noted that informal consultations had continued  through Friday night, and that agreed text had been added into the  draft decision and annexed draft framework. She invited delegates  to go through the text to confirm that it was accurate. Delegates  began discussing the draft framework. Due to the limited time, Co- Chair Afolabi proposed that the sections in the framework on  capacity building and mechanisms for technology transfer be  bracketed. On the Co-Chairs' proposal for a draft decision,  delegates agreed to delete one paragraph in the preamble of the  decision that recalls UNFCCC Article 4.5 (development and transfer  of technologies) and removed the brackets from a paragraph  recalling chapter 34 of Agenda 21 and relevant provisions of the  Programme for the Further implementation of Agenda 21. Due to time  constraints, the group agreed to submit the text with the  remaining brackets to the SBSTA for its consideration.

### LULUCF

The LULUCF contact group convened early in the afternoon  to take stock of progress. Co-Chairs Gwage and Thorgeirsson  explained that the Friends of the Chairs group had met for 11  hours through Friday night, but had not reached consensus on  enough issues to warrant drawing-up new text. Co-Chair  Thorgeirsson distributed draft SBSTA conclusions that transmit the  work of the first week to the second week. He said the text he had  introduced on Friday, 17 November, had been annexed to it and that  the unedited preambular Principles had been reinserted. A number  of delegates highlighted the need for further progress.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Contact group Co-Chair Kjellén introduced the new  Co-Chairs' text for the draft decision(s) on implementation of  UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 and matters relating to Protocol  Article 3.14, as well as text of the operative paragraphs on  implementation of Article 4.9 and a document including proposed  workshops relating to Article 4.8 and 4.9, Article 3.14 and LDCs.  Delegates debated whether information on which to base actions  should derive from both national communications and other relevant  information, or from just one of these two sources. They bracketed  these two alternatives. Co-Chair Kjellén noted that agreement on  the placement of the operative paragraphs on implementation of  Article 4.9 replacing a section in the draft decision(s) would be  announced by the G-77/China. The G-77/CHINA said it would present  a new version of the text on Monday. Delegates then agreed to  forward the draft decision(s) for consideration by the joint  SBI/SBSTA.

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): In a brief meeting of the contact  group on P&Ms, delegates agreed not to reopen negotiations on the  text. The G-77/CHINA, supported by the US, EU and SAUDI ARABIA,  expressed preference for the original title of the draft decision:  ' 'Good practices' in P&Ms among Parties included in Annex I to  the Convention.' Delegates expressed their appreciation to the Co- Chairs, and the meeting was closed.

# SBI

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Annex I Parties: SBI Chair Ashe opened  the meeting at 6:00 pm.The draft conclusions on national  communications from Annex I Parties, on greenhouse gas inventory  data from 1990 to 1998 (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.14), were adopted.

Non-Annex I Parties: Chair Ashe introduced the draft conclusions  on provision of financial and technical support  (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.12), and draft conclusions on the report of the  second meeting of the Consultative Group of Experts  (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.13). He also introduced the draft conclusions  on the second compilation and synthesis of initial national  communications of non-Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/2000/L.5). All  three documents were adopted.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Chair Ashe introduced the draft conclusions  on the report of the Global Environment Facility to the COP  (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.15).  He then introduced the draft conclusions  on additional guidance to the operating entity of the financial  mechanism (FCCC/SBI/2000/CRP.16/Rev.1) and requested Co-Chair  Groves of the contact group on the financial mechanism to provide  a report on the outcome of the discussions.  Co-Chair Groves said  that on the issue of funding for Stage II adaptation activities,  the G-77/CHINA wanted to have the COP-4 decision (2/CP.4) refined  so that Stage II adaptation activities could be based on national  communications or in-depth studies on vulnerability.  He said  Annex II Parties preferred to retain the thrust of the COP-4  decision with flexibility, allowing small island developing States  (SIDS) and LDCs to receive funding based solely on their  vulnerability.  Agreement had not been reached on text related to  deliberations in the adverse effects group.

The US and EU opposed a proposal by ARGENTINA in the SBI to clear  text on national communications that the contact group had left  bracketed. The G-77/CHINA, supported by ARGENTINA, AOSIS, SAUDI  ARABIA and other developing countries, expressed disappointment at  the lack of agreement on the financial mechanism.

### ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

On possible options to  respond to late payment of contributions, SBI agreed to Chair  Ashe's proposal to postpone consideration of this sub-item until  SB-14. Regarding the interim financial performance for 2000, the  SBI was asked to consider a status report on receipt of  contributions from Parties as at 31 October 2000  (FCCC/SBI/2000/INF.11). Parties took note of the latest status of  contributions. Draft decisions for consideration by COP-6 were  finalized at SB-13 Part I (FCCC/CP/2000/1/Add.1).

On implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, Chair Ashe noted  that issues had been raised regarding office space and visa  difficulties relating to the Secretariat in Bonn. GERMANY said it  had agreed on 14 November to offer joint accommodation for the  Secretariats of the UNFCCC and Convention to Combat  Desertification in the former parliamentarians' office building.  He noted ongoing efforts on other outstanding issues. SBI adopted  draft conclusions noting these statements, thanking Germany for  its offer, and requesting the Executive Secretary to report back  on progress at future sessions.

### OTHER MATTERS

SBI also adopted conclusions on the programme  budget for 2002-2003 by which it agrees to consider this item at  SB-14 with a view to recommending a budget for adoption at COP-7.  On issues related to Protocol Articles 7 and 8, SBI agreed to  forward conclusions on guidelines for adoption by COP-6. It then  adopted the report on the second part of its thirteenth session.

# JOINT SBI/SBSTA

### CAPACITY BUILDING

SBI Chair Ashe opened the joint meeting and  invited Jukka Uosukainen, with whom he had co-chaired a contact  group on capacity building in countries with economies in  transition (EITs) and in developing countries, to report on the  work of the group.

On capacity building in EITs, Co-Chair Uosukainen said the group  had agreed on a framework that sets out the scope and basis for  action in EITs, identifies EIT priorities, and outlines  responsibilities of EITs in implementing the framework and those  of Annex II Parties in assisting EITs.

He said the group agreed that the framework should guide capacity- building activities related to UNFCCC implementation. He noted the  cross-cutting nature of the outstanding issues relating to  financial issues, which had been conveyed to the group working on  the financial mechanism, and to the implementation of adaptation  measures and national programmes of action, currently being  considered under Article 4.8 and 4.9. In response to a question by  G-77/CHINA on how the financial issues will be resolved, Co-Chair  Ashe said these would be discussed by the ministers next week.  Delegates agreed to forward the SBSTA/SBI draft conclusions on  capacity building in EITs (FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.17) and in developing  countries FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.16) to the COP for its consideration.

### COMPLIANCE

Neroni Slade, Co-Chair of the Joint Working Group on  Compliance, presented the report of the Group on its work during  SB-13 Part II (FCCC/SB/2000/CRP15/Rev.1). He said delegates had  convened in formal and informal meetings over the previous week.  He underlined the constructive efforts of delegations during the  group's work. He said two submissions from Parties had been  inadvertently omitted: option 1 of Principles should be replaced  by option 1 contained in document FCCC/SB/2000/11; and the  sentence ['The procedures and mechanisms on compliance shall  operate without prejudice to any Multilteral Consultative Process  as referred in Article 16.'] should be added to the paragraph on  Relationship with Article 16. Following a request by NEW ZEALAND  to introduce an additional option in the final clauses, Co-Chair  Slade said Parties will have an opportunity to comment on the  document. The EU then requested the introduction of several  brackets. The report, as amended by Co-Chair Slade, was forwarded  to the COP.

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY

Chair Chow of the contact group on  Mechanisms reported on informal consultations that resulted in a  draft decision. The joint SBI/SBSTA agreed to forward the proposed  draft conclusions (FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.23) containing a draft  decision for the COP to consider.

### MECHANISMS

Chair Chow presented the draft conclusions on  mechanisms pursuant to Articles 6, 12 and 17 (contained in  FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.19, CRP.20 and Add.1, CRP.21, and CRP.22). He  noted that text had been mistakenly omitted, and that this would  be addressed in a revised document to be circulated by Monday.

The G-77/CHINA reiterated its core positions, including: a prompt  start to the CDM; the need for capacity building, particularly  within LDCs and SIDS; the issues of supplementarity, baselines,  additonality, monitoring, verification, and equity; adaptation  funding; equal treatment of the CDM; and the right of the host  developing country to be the sole judge of a project's  contribution to sustainable development. He said a number of  issues had been omitted from the text, including a definition of  supplementarity. SAUDI ARABIA said text was missing on  transferability and fungibility. AUSTRALIA undertook to provide a  written proposal regarding omitted text. After expressing  appreciation of Chair Chow's leadership, delegates adopted the  draft conclusions.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Contact group Co-Chair Salamat presented the  draft conclusions on implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9  and matters related to Protocol Article 3.14.  (FCCC/SB/2000/CRP.18). Highlighting the sense of cooperation in  the discussions, he stated that the text was not fully agreed. He  noted the guidance from President Pronk that all issues on  financing should be considered by the financial issues group.

The G-77/CHINA highlighted the importance to the Group of Article  4.8 and 4.9, and expressed concern that the issue of financial  resources is bracketed. With SAUDI ARABIA, she urged two separate  decisions, one on Article 4.8 and 4.9, the other on Article 3.14.  The EU, US and CANADA stated that draft conclusions are without  prejudice to whether there are one or two decisions. Highlighting  their vulnerability to climate change and response measures, the  LDCs expressed concern with the amount of bracketed text.  COLOMBIA, CHILE and VENEZUELA emphasized the vulnerability of all  developing countries. Chair Ashe closed the joint SBI/SBSTA  meeting at 9:55 pm.

# SBSTA

### LULUCF

Following the opening of the SBSTA meeting by Chair  Dovland, LULUCF contact group Co-Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the  draft decision to be forwarded to the COP  (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.11), noting that work on the operative text  had been guided by principles suggested by Parties. He outlined  the outcome of a session providing technical advice on sinks under  the mechanisms as well as submissions by Parties. He said the  session had highlighted concerns as well as optimism, including  suggested solutions to the problems of adverse environmental and  social effects, permanence and leakage. He underscored that  methodological issues differ according to project type, and  concluded that no consensus can be found on this matter. SBSTA  adopted the draft conclusions.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Contact group Co-Chair Paciornik introduced  draft SBSTA conclusions recommending  adoption by COP/MOP-1 of  guidelines under Article 5.1 (national systems)  (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.16), as well as draft SBSTA conclusions on  guidelines under Articles 5, 7 and 8 (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.17). He  said that although these guidelines still contained bracketed  text, progress was being made toward ensuring the Protocol's  credibility. He explained that the unresolved issues were of a  political or technical nature, or were waiting resolution in other  groups. He said a corrigendum to this document would be issued  early next week, to address existing omissions. SBSTA adopted both  draft conclusions.

### IMPACT OF SINGLE PROJECTS ON EMISSIONS IN THE COMMITMENT PERIOD

Chair Plougman reported that consultations on this issue had  resulted in 'an almost agreed' draft decision  (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.13). SBSTA adopted its draft conclusions on  this issue.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

Co-Chair Afolabi reported  that, with Co-Chair Cooper, he had convened six meetings of a  contact group and several informal consultations. He noted the  agreed text on three themes in the draft framework to enhance  implementation of Article 4.5: technology needs and needs  assessment, technology information, and enabling environment-  while two themes, on capacity building and mechanisms for  technology transfer, remained in brackets. He said more time was  needed to consult and review all possible actions. Underscoring  the importance of implementing Article 4.5, the G-77/CHINA  expressed concern over the failure of some Parties to implement  their commitments, and stressed the need to make progress on the  outstanding issues. SBSTA adopted its draft conclusions containing  the draft decision and annexed draft framework  (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.15).

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Co-Chair Roméro introduced the draft  conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.14). He noted agreement on the  value of exchanging experiences on P&Ms and on workshops, and  divergence over demonstrable progress. Delegates adopted these  draft conclusions.

### OTHER MATTERS

Delegates also adopted draft conclusions on  cooperation with relevant international organizations  (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.12). In concluding, SBSTA adopted the draft  report on its work (FCCC/SBSTA/2000/CRP.12). Chair Dovland closed  the session at 11.15 pm.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates will enter the final week at The Hague with a morass of  political and technical issues remaining on the negotiating table.  Reflecting on progress made in last week's informal negotiations,  some observers noted movement on clearing bracketed text,  particularly on Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8. In spite of some  progress, however, most participants felt the remaining workload  has not been sufficiently reduced to pave the way for ministers  and heads of delegation to focus on a few key political decisions,  unencumbered by technical issues.

Reviewing the state of negotiations entering the final week, a  number of developing country delegates expressed frustration at  what they believe are attempts to block progress on priority  issues for the G-77/China - such as funding, capacity building and  technology transfer. They are adamant that these will have to be  given the 'recognition they deserve' for any agreement to be  reached at COP-6. Participants from a number of developed  countries have also expressed concerns at what one described as  the 'snail's pace' of talks.

Another issue under discussion among delegates is the process  planned by COP-6 President Jan Pronk for the final week. President  Pronk's proposal to consider outstanding issues by dividing  ministers into three negotiating groups has generated concern  within the G-77/China. However, some observers underlined that it  is the prerogative of the COP-6 President to lead the process in a  manner he deems most effective. Despite uncertainties on how this  will be achieved, they expressed tentative confidence on the way  forward.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### COP-6 PLENARY

Delegates to COP-6 are expected to meet in the  Prins Willem Alexander Hall at 10:00 am, with a second meeting  scheduled to start at 3:00 pm. After addressing organizational  matters and the reports of the subsidiary bodies, the Plenary is  expected to begin hearing formal statements from observer states  and non-governmental organizations. Negotiations are also likely  to resume in the afternoon in parallel with these formal  statements. For more information, consult the electronic  noticeboards.
