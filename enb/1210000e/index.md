# PLENARY

In opening Thursday morning's Plenary, the INC Chair  reported that the Eastern European Group has nominated the  Russian Federation and Hungary and the Asian Group has  nominated India and Japan for positions on the COP Bureau.  Japan then announced that it would make an additional  US$100,000 contribution to the Voluntary Fund for the  participation of the least developed countries at COP-1.

### AGENDA ITEM 6 - RULES OF PROCEDURE

Amb. Sreenivasan  introduced A/AC.237/L.22/Rev.2, which contains the results  of his informal consultations on the Rules of Procedure. He  noted that Rule 42 remains within square brackets. He also  noted that one delegation submitted additional proposals on  Rule 22 (officers) and Rule 27 (subsidiary bodies) during  the consultations. Although there was discussion of these  rules, there was no consensus. One delegation asked to put  Rule 54 (languages) in brackets, but since there was no  support for this proposal, the delegate was informed that  its views would be summarized in the report of INC-11. In  the event that there is no agreement on the Rules of  Procedure, the Plenary will have to come up with a  contingency plan - either continue to apply the rules of the  INC or adopt only the Rules of Procedure that are agreed  upon.

Rule 42 - Voting: Venezuela, Kuwait, Colombia, Saudi Arabia,  Nigeria, Iran, China and Zaire preferred Alternative B,  which ensures that substantive decisions, including the  adoption of protocols, are taken by consensus. The EU,  Australia, Japan, Canada, Czech Republic, Brazil,  Switzerland, South Africa and Slovakia expressed favor for  Alternative A, provided that paragraph (b) reads that a  decision to adopt a protocol would be taken by a 3/4  majority. New Zealand and the US preferred Alternative A and  are flexible on either a 2/3 or 3/4 majority.

Trinidad and Tobago, on behalf of AOSIS, the Marshall  Islands, Samoa, Micronesia, Norway, Mauritius, Solomon  Islands and Cuba preferred Alternative A, provided that  paragraph (b) is deleted, and that protocols are considered  matters of substance, which will be adopted by consensus or,  as a last resort, a 2/3 majority vote. New Zealand,  Mauritius and Egypt called for the deletion of Alternative  A, paragraph (c) on decisions under paragraph 3 of Article 4  and paragraphs 1, 3 or 4 of Article 11, which shall be taken  by consensus.

Rule 22 - Officers: The Chair invited comments on Rule 22,  Officers, and Non-Paper No. 2, which proposed including a  representative from the oil exporting countries in the  Bureau. Venezuela commented that this proposal had been  submitted during informal consultations, but the Bureau  rejected it without legal authority. The Chair said the  rules have been discussed at length for more than two years  and that the Bureau's mandate allowed limiting the options  so that the Plenary could complete its work. Saudi Arabia,  Iran, Kuwait, Indonesia, Algeria and Nigeria said that the  issue had not been discussed thoroughly and wanted the  proposal included in brackets.

Antigua and Barbuda asked the Vice-Chair which countries had  proposed the current draft and if any group had objected to  its acceptance. The Vice-Chair replied that the draft  reflected a G-77 proposal and no group objected at the time.  Uruguay commented that the COP should not begin without  rules of procedure and urged countries to accept the rules  now and propose amendments later.

The US, supported by the EU, Australia, Canada and New  Zealand, objected to the proposal on substantive, rather  than procedural, grounds. There are many categories of  'special needs' countries, besides AOSIS, and opening the  Bureau to one will require opening it to the others. The EU  added that the small island States face a physical threat,  whereas the OPEC countries face only economic adjustments  like every other Party. Japan suggested a provision that  would allow the President to convene 'extended' bureau  meetings to allow these countries to express their views.

Rule 30 - Conduct of Business: The US noted that Rule 30 in  A/AC.237/L.22/Rev.1, on meetings of the COP and the  subsidiary bodies, had a footnote allowing accredited  observers to participate in 'private' meetings. She said  that unless the footnote was included, the US would request  further discussion. The Chair stated that Paragraph 106(c)  of the Report of the Committee (A/AC.237/41) covers the  footnote. The US preferred its inclusion in the Rules of  Procedure since no other Party objected.

Rule 54 - Languages: Japan proposed that Rule 54, which  lists six official languages, remain unaltered, but that a  second paragraph or a footnote should be included stating,  'The lack of documentation or interpretation in any these  languages due to budgetary constraints shall not interrupt  the smooth proceeding of COP and its subsidiary bodies.' New  Zealand supported the proposal, but changed the word 'any'  to 'all.' The Russian Federation, supported by the EU, China  and Kuwait, said this proposal was completely unacceptable  because it would cast doubt on the use of all six languages  and revise a standard UN practice. The Russian Federation  added that if Japan insisted on including this provision, it  would propose bracketing the entire document. Japan said it  could not accept Rule 54 without the additional provision,  and would have to bracket the rule.

The Chair closed the meeting by announcing that he would  hold further consultations on these rules in an attempt to  reach a consensus before he reconvened the Plenary at 4:30  pm. However, at 6:00 pm he announced that the Plenary would  not reconvene because he was still consulting. He asked  interested delegations to remain in the room to facilitate  the consultative process.

# WORKING GROUP I

Working Group I did not meet until 10:00 pm. Delegates had  negotiated during the day in a number of contact groups. By  early evening all had produced consensus drafts except the  group addressing adequacy of commitments, which negotiated  for several hours over language referring to Article 4.2(a)  and (b).

AGENDA ITEM 7(a) - FIRST REVIEW OF NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS:  The Group adopted future document A/AC.237/WG.1/L.27, draft  conclusions and recommendations on review of national  communications by Annex I Parties. The draft urges Annex I  Parties that have not yet submitted their first  communications to do so, requests a second communication by  15 April 1997 and annual emissions inventories, and asks the  Secretariat to compile views on these guidelines. It also  mandates an in-depth review for all communications and a  second synthesis report in 'non-confrontational' language  that, as appropriate, names Parties.

The Chair introduced a second draft decision that replaces  paragraphs 7 and 8 of A/AC.237/WG.1/L.27, requests that  subsidiary bodies develop for COP-2 a set of guidelines for  communications from non-Annex I Parties, and asks the  Secretariat to compile views on the guidelines. France, on  behalf of the EU, added 'bearing in mind the discussions on  the subject held during INC-10 and 11' to the preamble. The  Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, objected. The  Chair's text was adopted without the amendment.

AGENDA ITEM 7(b) - ADEQUACY OF COMMITMENTS: The Working  Group adopted document A/AC.237/WG.I//L.28, a Review of the  Adequacy of Commitments in Article 4, Paragraph 2(a) and  (b). The contact group agreed that the draft's fourth  paragraph states that Article 4.2(a) and (b) is 'only a  first step in implementing the objective of the Convention  and it is subject to review at the first session of the  Conference of the Parties under Article 4.2(d) of the  Convention.' The text was adopted with applause from  delegates.

AGENDA ITEM 7(c) - JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: A contact group met  Thursday on JI but was unable to resolve differences that  had extended the previous day's debate past midnight. The  draft decision on criteria for joint implementation, adopted  in future document A/AC.237/WG.1/L.29, recommends that COP-1  continue consideration of JI criteria based on views  expressed and three separate draft texts, future documents  A/AC.237/WG.I/L.30 from the G-77 and China,  A/AC.237/WG.1/L.31 from the EU and A/AC.237/WG.1/L.32 from  the US. The Chair said the Group had made progress in  transmitting responsibility to the ministers in Berlin.

AGENDA ITEM 7(d) - METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES: The text in  A/AC.237/WG.1/L.25 was adopted. It includes a decision that  the IPCC guidelines or simplified default methodologies  'should be used by non-Annex I Parties, as appropriate and  to the extent possible, in the fulfillment of their  commitments under the Convention.' It also states that  Parties may use Global Warming Potentials to express their  inventories and projections in CO2 equivalents, using the  IPCC 1994 Special Report's 100-year time horizon. It also  instructs the SBSTA to examine methodological issues and  invites relevant international organizations and bodies,  including the IPCC, to contribute to SBSTA work on  methodologies.

AGENDA ITEM 7(e) - SUBSIDIARY BODIES: The Co-Chairs' draft  decision on subsidiary bodies was presented in future  document A/AC.237/WG.1/L.26. Brackets were removed from  Appendix II(e) relating to intergovernmental technical  advisory panels and left as 'and approved by the Conference  of the Parties.' Kenya amended paragraph 2(b) on the SBI to  include 'and make recommendations to the COP on' the report  from the operating entity of the financial mechanism.

Annex I, on the functions of the SBSTA, directs the SBSTA  to: summarize scientific, technical, socio-economic and  other information provided by competent bodies, including  the IPCC; consider scientific, technical and socio-economic  aspects of the in-depth reviews; and carry out various tasks  related to technology transfer. SBSTA would also deal with  methodologies for inventories, projections, effects of  measures, impact/sensitivity analyses and adaptation. The  SBI would consider policy aspects of in-depth reviews,  effects on emissions trends of steps taken by Parties and  any further commitments, and advise the COP on the financial  mechanism, technology transfer, adequacy of commitments,  including conducting negotiations on resolutions, amendments  and protocols.

Tasks for the SBSTA between COP-1 and -2 include review of  the second IPCC assessment and methodological issues, and  defining aspects of any technical advisory panels. The SBI  would oversee in-depth reviews of policy aspects of national  communications, consider reports of the operating entity of  the financial mechanism and undertake tasks on the follow-up  to the adequacy of commitments. Brackets around the January  1996 date of the intergovernmental technical advisory panels  meeting were removed from the schedule in Annex III. The  schedule adds a workshop on non-governmental inputs open to  all Parties and interested non-governmental participants to  discuss non-governmental advisory committees and/or a  business consultative mechanism and consideration of the  work of the workshop by subsidiary bodies. The text was  adopted.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The Contact Group discussing the physical location of the  Permanent Secretariat met Thursday afternoon with the  representatives of the four countries offering to host the  Secretariat - Canada, Germany, Switzerland and Uruguay.  While some members of the Group said they had made progress,  it appeared as though the Contact Group was not yet in a  position to make a recommendation to the Plenary on this  matter. It seems that a number of delegations do not have  instructions from their capitals on location preferences,  should this matter come to a vote on Friday. If the INC is  not able to make a recommendation to the COP, it is likely  that the decision will not be taken at COP-1. In that case,  it may be some time before the Permanent Secretariat has a  permanent home.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### PLENARY

The Plenary will not meet today until 12:00 pm to  allow time for last-minute negotiations to be completed and  the documentation to be ready. The meeting is expected to  continue without a lunch break until all of the decisions  are adopted and the INC has completed its business.
