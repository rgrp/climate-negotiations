abstract: "The twenty-second sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB-22) of the  United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  take place from 19-27 May 2005, at the Maritim Hotel in Bonn,  Germany. SB-22 will be the first Subsidiary Bodies meetings since  the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol in February 2005."
---

The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) will consider  arrangements for the first Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol and eleventh Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in  late 2005. The SBI will also address various administrative and  financial matters, including the programme budget for 2006-2007  and the Special Climate Change Fund, and matters relating to the  Least Developed Countries and national communications.

The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice  (SBSTA) will consider the scientific, technical and socioeconomic  aspects of climate change with regards to mitigation,  vulnerability and adaptation. It will also take up various  methodological issues, the development and transfer of  technologies, policies and measures among Annex I Parties,  research needs relating to the UNFCCC, cooperation with relevant  international organizations, and implementation of Protocol  Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures).

As well as the official meetings of the Subsidiary Bodies,  numerous side events are scheduled on a range of climate change  topics.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats  to sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, natural resources,  physical infrastructure and the environment. Global climate varies  naturally but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically produced greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and scientific findings  indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 189 Parties. The Parties to the UNFCCC typically convene once  a year in a Conference of the Parties (COP), and twice a year in  meetings of the UNFCCC's Subsidiary Bodies.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In December 1997, delegates at COP-3 in Kyoto,  Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  (EITs) to achieve quantified emissions reduction targets. These  countries, known under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to  reduce their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an  average of 5.2% below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first  commitment period), with specific targets varying from country to  country. The Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms  to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets  cost-effectively: an emissions trading system; joint  implementation (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between  Annex I Parties; and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which  allows for projects to be implemented in non-Annex I Parties.  Following COP-3, Parties initiated negotiations on most of the  rules and operational details determining how countries will  reduce emissions, and measure and assess emissions reductions.  To date, 150 Parties have ratified the Protocol, including 37  Annex I Parties, representing 61.6% of 1990 Annex I greenhouse  gas emissions, meeting the requirements for entry into force of  the Protocol, which took place on 16 February 2005.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

The Buenos Aires Plan of Action  (BAPA) was negotiated at COP-4 in 1998, to set out a process for  taking forward the provisions of the Protocol. The BAPA set COP-6  as the deadline for reaching agreement on the operational details  of the Protocol and on strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC.  In particular, Protocol issues to be addressed included rules  relating to the flexible mechanisms, a regime for assessing  Parties' compliance, accounting methods for national emissions and  emissions reductions, and rules on crediting countries for carbon  sinks. Issues under the UNFCCC that required resolution included  questions of capacity building, the development and transfer of  technology, and assistance to those developing countries  particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change  or to actions taken by industrialized countries to combat climate  change.

Following agreement on the BAPA at COP-4, subsequent meetings  attempted to reach agreement on the various elements of the work  programme. In November 2000, Parties met at COP-6 in The Hague,  the Netherlands, and attempted to complete these negotiations  without success. COP-6 was suspended until July 2001 when it  reconvened in Bonn, Germany. Delegates held protracted  consultations, and finally agreed to adopt a political decision,  the Bonn Agreements. However, this political decision could only  be operationalized through a package of COP decisions on specific  issues such as the flexible mechanisms, compliance and land use,  land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). As delegates were unable to  finalize text on every decision, they agreed to forward all the  draft decisions to COP-7 for final resolution.

### THE MARRAKESH ACCORDS

Delegates continued discussions on the Bonn  Agreements at COP-7 in October/November 2001. Following extensive  negotiations, the Marrakesh Accords were adopted and have served  as the basis for subsequent negotiations. The Marrakesh Accords  set out building blocks for decisions under the Protocol and  UNFCCC, including: the flexible mechanisms and LULUCF; rules for  compliance; rules on communicating and reviewing information on  emissions and removals of greenhouse gases; and issues relating to  support for developing countries, including capacity building,  technology transfer, responding to the adverse effects of climate  change, and the establishment of three funds - the Least Developed  Countries (LDC) Fund, the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and  the Adaptation Fund.

### COP-8 & COP-9

Delegates met at COP-8 in October/November 2002,  and again at COP-9 in December 2003, to negotiate decisions for  implementing the Marrakesh Accords. Among other things, Parties  agreed on rules and procedures for the CDM Executive Board (EB),  the body designated to supervise the CDM, and modalities and  procedures for afforestation and reforestation (A&R) activities  under the CDM. Parties also discussed how to integrate findings of  the IPCC's Third Assessment Report into the work of the UNFCCC,  agreeing on two new agenda items on adaptation and on mitigation.

### SB-20

In June 2004, delegates met in Bonn at the twentieth  sessions of SBI and SBSTA. Among other things, SBSTA-20 considered  small-scale A&R CDM project activities and good practice guidance  (GPG) on LULUCF, and held two in-session workshops on adaptation,  and on mitigation. SBI-20 addressed the UNFCCC's financial  mechanism and arrangements for intergovernmental meetings.

### COP-10

COP-10 was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina, from 6-18  December 2004. The meeting involved lengthy negotiations on how to  engage on commitments to combat climate change in the post-2012  period. The Kyoto Protocol requires Parties to begin considering  the post-2012 period by 2005. Delegates eventually agreed to hold  a Seminar of Governmental Experts prior to SB-22 in May 2005.  However, the terms of reference for the Seminar did not refer to  the post-2012 period or new commitments. Rather, they stated that  the purpose of the Seminar was to promote 'an informal exchange of  information on: (a) actions relating to mitigation and adaptation  to assist Parties to continue to develop effective and appropriate  responses to climate change; and (b) policies and measures adopted  by their respective governments that support implementation of  their existing commitments under the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.' Delegates also agreed on a package on adaptation - the Buenos  Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response Measures -  supporting further implementation of measures to adapt to the  adverse effects of climate change, while also addressing calls for  economic diversification for countries affected by the global  community's response measures to deal with climate change.

In addition, Parties addressed and adopted numerous decisions and  conclusions on issues such as technology transfer, land-use change  and forestry, the UNFCCC's financial mechanism, and education,  training and public awareness. Some issues remain unresolved, and  will be taken up again in 2005. These include negotiations on the  LDC Fund, the SCCF, national communications from developing  countries (non-Annex I Parties), and Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse  effects of policies and measures).

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### WORLD CONFERENCE ON DISASTER REDUCTION

The World Conference on  Disaster Reduction was held from 18-22 January 2005, in Kobe,  Japan. Negotiators agreed on a ten-year plan to build the  resilience of countries and communities to disasters, and adopted  a statement on the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami aimed at  reducing the risk from future disasters.

### INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE STABILIZATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES

This symposium, held from 1-3 February 2005, in Exeter, UK, sought  to advance scientific understanding of and encourage scientific  debate on the long-term implications of climate change, the  relevance of stabilization goals, and technological options to  reach such goals.

### THIRD EARTH OBSERVATION SUMMIT

This Summit, held in Brussels,  Belgium, on 16 February 2005, resulted in governments endorsing a  10-year implementation plan for the development of a Global Earth  Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Delegates also adopted a  communiqué supporting tsunami and multi-hazard warning systems  within the context of the GEOSS.

### G8 ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT MINISTERS MEETING

The Environment  and Development Ministers of the G8 countries met from 17-18 March  2005, in Derbyshire, UK. On the issue of climate change, ministers  noted Africa's particular vulnerability and agreed that urgent  action is necessary to help the vulnerable adapt. They also  recognized the need to increase access to reliable and affordable  energy services for Africans living in poverty.

### UNFCCC MEETINGS

A number of UNFCCC events have taken place since  COP-10, including a regional workshop for Latin America and the  Caribbean on education, training and public awareness (30 March to  1 April 2005, Montevideo, Uruguay); a workshop on national systems  (11-12 April 2005, Bonn, Germany); a meeting of the Consultative  Group of Experts on National Communications from Non-Annex I  Parties (14-15 April 2005, Maputo, Mozambique); and two meetings  of the Executive Board of the CDM (23-25 February and 11-13 May  2005, Bonn). Several pre-sessional meetings were also held in Bonn  in the days leading up to SB-22, including a meeting of the Expert  Group on Technology Transfer (12-14 May 2005), informal  consultations on the LDC Fund (13-14 May 2005), and consultations  on registry systems (13-14 May 2005).

### SEMINAR OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS

A Seminar of Governmental Experts  was also held prior to SB-22, on 16-17 May 2005, in Bonn. The  decision to hold a Seminar was taken by Parties at COP-10. The  Seminar involved an exchange of information on actions relating to  mitigation and adaptation to help Parties continue to develop  effective responses to climate change; and on policies and  measures that support implementation of existing commitments under  the UNFCCC and the Protocol.
