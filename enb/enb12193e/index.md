# SBSTA

## OPENING PLENARY

SBSTA Chair Halldor Thorgeirsson (Iceland)  welcomed delegates and observers and noted that the focus of work  has shifted from negotiations on the Protocol to issues of  implementation. UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter said  that a total of 74 Parties have now ratified the Protocol,  representing 35.8% of industrialized countries' total greenhouse  gas emissions.

JAPAN and the EU drew attention to their recent ratifications, and  encouraged other Parties to follow suit. VENEZUELA, for the G-77/CHINA, said that the recent focus on the Protocol has meant  that some UNFCCC issues have been neglected, particularly those  relevant to developing countries. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION stated  that national consultations on ratifying the Protocol should be  completed by the end of the year.

## ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

On the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/1 and  Add.1), Chair Thorgeirsson noted a request to add an item on  Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects) to the agendas of both  subsidiary bodies. The EU recalled that decision 5/CP.7 addresses  Article 2.3. SAUDI ARABIA said Parties had agreed that decisions  on Protocol and UNFCCC issues would be kept separate. With the G-77/CHINA and opposed by the EU, JAPAN, and AUSTRALIA, he supported  inserting this agenda item.

On a proposal by Canada on cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting  energy, the G-77/CHINA said the item was incorrectly worded on the  provisional agenda, and it should refer to the report of the  workshop on this issue, not to a proposal. CANADA said the  provisional agenda correctly referred to a proposal and, supported  by several Annex I Parties and UZBEKISTAN, but opposed by SAUDI  ARABIA and the G-77/CHINA, stressed retaining the issue as worded  in the provisional agenda.

Following consultations, Parties agreed with the Chair's proposal  that the agenda items on clean energy and on Article 2.3 be held  in abeyance. Chair Thorgeirsson said further consultations would  be carried out on the agenda, and the results reported back next  week. SBSTA then adopted the modified agenda.

## IPCC THIRD ASSESSMENT REPORT (TAR)

IPCC Chair Rajendra K.  Pachauri invited Parties to make full use of the information  contained in the TAR, and noted that work on the fourth assessment  report will begin in 2003 and end in 2007. In the ensuing  discussion, many Parties emphasized the need for a work plan.  SAUDI ARABIA said such a plan should not be developed until  climate change impacts on developing countries are elaborated and  scientific uncertainties are minimized. Parties emphasized the  importance of disseminating the TAR and suggested that future work  could focus on: resolving scientific uncertainties, particularly  at the regional level; identifying barriers to implementing  adaptation and mitigation measures; improving observation systems;  and promoting the participation of developing country scientists  in the IPCC. CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA and ALGERIA, stressed the  need for additional work on the historical responsibility for  climate change and on equity issues. The EU, with SWITZERLAND and  SLOVENIA, said information contained in the TAR justified further  action on climate change, and suggested consideration of the  scientific and technical issues Parties would like the IPCC to  address in the future. NORWAY remarked on the need to agree on  stronger emissions reductions and broader participation beyond  2012, suggesting that SBSTA launch a process to strengthen  commitments. SAUDI ARABIA said a dangerous level of greenhouse  gases could not be determined given scientific uncertainties.   AUSTRALIA, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, suggested including follow-up  to the TAR as a standing item on the SBSTA agenda. SWITZERLAND  argued that making continuous reference to the TAR in each agenda  item of SBSTA would be more efficient than initiating a separate  process.

IPCC Secretariat Executive Secretary Geoffrey Love welcomed  collaboration between SBSTA and the IPCC, and drew attention to  the fourth assessment report and special and technical reports to  be produced by the IPCC. Chair Thorgeirsson said a contact group  would be convened on the issue, co-chaired by David Warrilow (UK)  and Rawleston Moore (Barbados).

## METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

### Guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and  8:

On guidelines on reporting and review of greenhouse gas  inventories from Annex I Parties (implementing decisions 3/CP.5  and 6/CP.5), the Secretariat provided an overview of relevant  recommendations and experiences of the technical review process   (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/5; FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2; FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.1-3).  He said the review process aimed to establish more complete and  transparent guidelines and highlighted the need to: improve  guidelines through a common reporting format (CRF); better define  draft report objectives; incorporate a new concept of literature  reviewers; and consider timing and length of the review process.

The EU underlined the need to increase resources for technical  reviews and annual inventories. The US supported improving  software, particularly in the synthesis and inventory assessment  phase. A contact group, chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and  Newton Paciornik (Brazil) will meet to consider these issues.

On guidelines for the preparation of information required under  Article 7 and for review under Article 8 and good practice  guidance for Article 5.2 (adjustments), Chair Thorgeirsson  indicated that sections of the guidelines were not concluded  during COP-7. He said the various issues, including reporting and  review of assigned amounts and national registries, and expedited  review for the reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms,  had been forwarded to SB-16. COP-7 had also requested SB-16 to  deal with the technical aspects of review of demonstrable progress  and the treatment of confidential information.

Audun Rosland reported on the outcome of a workshop on adjustments  under Article 5.2, held in Athens from 3-5 April. He said  participants had recommended that adjustments be used as an  exception, and that the procedure should be simple. He said a  second workshop would be organized in early 2003 to assess case  studies of simulated adjustments, and to help ensure consistent  application of adjustments between review teams.

Regarding the expedited review for reinstatement of eligibility,  the EU stressed the need for a process compatible with the regular  review process and the compliance procedure. Chair Thorgeirsson  said a contact group would be convened under the guidance of Helen  Plume (New Zealand) and Festus Luboyera (South Africa).

On technical standards for registries under Article 7.4, Murray  Ward (New Zealand) reported on the outcome of consultations  conducted from 2-3 June. He said registries were needed to  operationalize the accounting of assigned amounts and provide  transparency. He noted that most Annex I country registries are at  an early stage of development, and said delegates had considered  the nature and scope for standards, concluding that they should be  applied to aspects relevant to exchange of data and the  transaction log. He said draft technical standards should be  developed before SB-17. Chair Thorgeirsson said Murray Ward would  conduct informal consultations.

###     Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ):

Chair Thorgeirsson noted a  COP-7 decision to continue the pilot phase for AIJ (decision  8/CP.7) and to hold a workshop on the draft revised uniform  reporting format, which was held in Bonn from 2-3 June  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.9). Participants were then briefed on the  report of the meeting and on other relevant documents, including a  compilation of Parties' submissions on their experiences with the  AIJ pilot phase (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC. 2).

Several parties endorsed the AIJ pilot phase and welcomed the  recent workshop. KENYA, for the G-77/CHINA, said the geographic  distribution of projects should be improved, particularly for  Africa. UGANDA said unfair distribution could impact on Africa's  level of project experience, and thus its ability to participate  in the CDM. CHINA said any modification to the uniform reporting  format should not affect decisions already taken on AIJ,  particularly those relating to funding and technology transfer.  Participants agreed to the formation of a contact group to prepare  draft conclusions and possibly a draft COP-8 decision for  consideration by SBSTA on 13 June.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### AIJ

The contact group on the uniform reporting format (URF) for  AIJ under the pilot phase was chaired by Mamadou Honadia (Burkina  Faso) and Sushma Gera (Canada). The group considered the draft  revised URF (FCCC/SB/2000/6/Add.1) and changes to the draft that  had been proposed during the recent AIJ workshop. Delegates agreed  to a number of proposals on several sections of the draft,  including those on governmental acceptance, approval or  endorsement and on general compatibility with national development  priorities. The group will continue its discussions on Friday to  consider outstanding proposed textual changes on: mutually agreed  assessment procedures; summary of AIJ projects; and additional  comments.

### ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

The Secretariat provided an overview of the  issues to be covered by SB-16 in relation to Articles 5, 7 and 8,  namely: pending parts of the guidelines under Articles 7 and 8,  including reporting and review of assigned amounts and national  registries and review for the reinstatement of eligibility to use  the mechanisms; adjustments under Article 5.2; demonstrable  progress; and treatment of confidential data. He said relevant  completed draft decisions would be forwarded to COP-8 for  adoption. The Secretariat then introduced the documents for the  session, and Newton Paciornik presented the outcome of the  workshop on adjustments under Article 5.2, which had developed  draft technical guidance and made recommendations for a second  workshop after SB-17. He said the issue of how to develop a  conservative approach to adjustments merited further discussion,  and that testing of the methodology for adjustments would be  carried out prior to the next workshop, based on the data from  2000-2001 inventories. Regarding timing, the Secretariat proposed  that the case studies be carried out at the end of the year,  allowing Parties time to comment on the studies prior to the  workshop, which would be held in April. On the issue of treatment  of confidential information, Parties preferred to further discuss  it at SB-17, following Party submissions on 1 August 2002. The  Secretariat distributed a Working Paper on the review of  reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms, and the  meeting was adjourned.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

'Nothing new' and 'same as ever' were phrases being used by  delegates to describe the opening day of SB-16. After the tension  and brinkmanship characterizing the climate meetings held in 2000  and 2001, participants at SB-16 are clearly expecting something  far more 'low key' this time around. Several observers pointed out  that attention is firmly focused on the negotiations now taking  place in Bali ahead of the upcoming Johannesburg Summit.

Yet in spite of the quiet atmosphere anticipated in Bonn, the  meeting was not without tension on its opening day, with many  participants discussing the discord over two proposals raised by  Canada and Saudi Arabia. The Canadian proposal is controversial  because some observers see it as an attempt for Canada to gain  further flexibility under the Protocol from its energy exports.

The Saudi Arabian proposal to discuss adverse effects under the  Protocol brought back memories of lengthy discussions on whether  UNFCCC and Protocol Articles on adverse effects should be  addressed separately or together - discussions many delegates  would prefer not to relive.
