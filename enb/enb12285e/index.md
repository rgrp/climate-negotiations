# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### ADAPTATION

Delegates proceeded through the Co-Chairs' draft annex  on the SBSTA programme of work on adaptation, addressing specific  activities in the programme. Many Parties underscored the need for  a more focused approach, engaging outside experts and users, and  encouraging long-term cooperation. The G-77/CHINA and others  called for a two-track approach that could address more urgent  needs, as well as establishment of an expert group, bottom-up  approaches, and some shorter deadlines. CANADA suggested  requesting a technical report on analytical tools for adaptation  planning and development, and on assessment of adaptation options.  The EU proposed a web-based adaptation case-study database, and  the US called for engagement with sectoral experts. AUSTRALIA,  supported by many others, noted the need for more than one  workshop to stimulate ongoing collaborative work. Informal  consultations continued throughout the day.

### ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Delegates considered draft COP and COP/MOP  decisions from the Co-Chairs, agreeing to revised versions of  both. The Secretariat will make editorial changes and distribute  the agreed texts on Saturday morning.

### CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD REPORT

Parties met informally to work through  the Co-Chairs' draft decision. Several developed countries  proposed deleting a paragraph on the CDM's continuity beyond 2012,  suggesting that this should be addressed in the Protocol Article  3.9 contact group. Developing countries highlighted the importance  of this issue.

Developing countries proposed language on retroactive crediting  for projects entering the CDM project cycle by 31 December 2005.  Discussions revealed differences amongst the Parties on carbon  dioxide capture and storage under the CDM, and on whether local,  national or regional policy standards and programmes can be  considered CDM project activities. A group of developed countries  suggested adding several paragraphs on the Executive Board's role  and efficiency, while a developing country opposed the proposal,  emphasizing the Board's functions agreed under the Marrakesh  Accords. Parties also discussed a paragraph on new proposals to  demonstrate additionality, with various proposals being put  forward.

### COMPLIANCE

Delegates met informally to consider a draft decision  provided by the Africa Group. The draft contains one operational  paragraph on adopting the compliance procedures as contained in  Decision 24/CP.7, and another paragraph on commencing a process  for amending the Protocol to be concluded by MOP 2 and leading to  a compliance system entailing legally-binding consequences. A  developed country provided another draft decision as an  alternative to the second paragraph, proposing initiation of a  process to consider the need for an amendment. Informal  consultations co-chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and Mamadou  Honadia (Burkina Faso) will continue on Saturday.

### EDUCATION, TRAINING AND PUBLIC AWARENESS (UNFCCC ARTICLE 6)

The  contact group reconvened late Friday morning to discuss Chair  D'Auvergne's revised draft SBI conclusions. Delegates completed  their work and approved the text after making several changes.  These changes included the insertion by the EU of language  clarifying that an upcoming workshop on SIDS should specifically  be on Article 6. In addition, NAMIBIA added text encouraging  institutions, as well as Parties, to strengthen new and existing  national Article 6 focal points.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

The contact group met throughout the day and  in numerous informal consultations, taking up issues relating to  the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), Decision 5/CP.8, the  report of the GEF, the Adaptation Fund, and other matters.

### SCCF

Delegates considered a Co-Chairs' draft decision, but were  unable to reach agreement on language regarding the priority areas  for the SCCF, and the timing regarding the COP's review of the  status of SCCF implementation in such areas. Following informal  consultations, Parties agreed to forward the draft text to the  SBI Chair and/or COP President, along with proposals from the  G-77/China and EU.

###     Implementation of Decision 5/CP.8

Delegates approved a draft SBI  decision expressing appreciation for the report on experience of  international funds and multilateral financial institutions  relevant to the investment needs of developing countries in  meeting their commitments under the Convention, and noting that  the report and the assessment of funding necessary to assist  developing countries in fulfilling their commitments will be used  as input for the third review of the financial mechanism to be  reported on at COP 12.

###     Other Matters

Delegates also engaged in a preliminary discussion  on a proposal from the G-77/China that would request more  information from the GEF on the RAF and ask the Secretariat to  examine and report on the conformity of the RAF with the COP-GEF  Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The US said the proposal was  unnecessary given existing guidance to the GEF, while the EU and  others opposed reference to the conformity of the RAF with the  MOU. The Co-Chairs will consult informally.

###     GEF Report to the COP

Delegates considered a draft Co-Chairs'  decision. Micronesia, speaking for AOSIS and supported by the G-77/CHINA and others, noted the need to be equitable when making  reference to concerns raised by Parties about the contents of the  GEF's report. Parties agreed that the text should be shortened.  The issue will be taken up again on Saturday.

###     Adaptation Fund

The EU and G-77/CHINA each presented draft  decisions. The EU highlighted using a sliding scale on  co-financing to measure additional costs. The G-77/CHINA noted  the need for an MOU between the COP-MOP and the operating entity  of the financial mechanism of the Convention and the need to  avoid the 'onerous operational policies on eligibility criteria,'  including 'incremental costs.' The G-77/CHINA said that its  proposal should be used as the basis for negotiations, while the  EU, supported by NORWAY and SWITZERLAND, said the Co-Chairs should  produce a draft based on both proposals. A compilation of the two  documents will be prepared in time for Saturday's meeting.  However, the Co-Chairs indicated that it would not necessarily  form the basis for negotiations, as Parties first had to discuss  how to proceed.

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION LOG

Chair Ward reported on informal  discussions held since the previous contact group meeting. He  noted Parties' questions about the timelines for activities set  out in the draft. The Secretariat briefed delegates on the  schedule of activities for implementing the international  transaction log. Chair Ward distributed a revised draft text,  which notes the importance of the international transaction log to  the Kyoto mechanisms, and requests the Secretariat to implement  the log in 2006, with a view to allowing registry systems to  successfully connect to the log by April 2007. Delegates sought  clarification on several issues. A revised text will be prepared  by Saturday afternoon.

### IPCC'S SPECIAL REPORT ON CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE

Delegates met informally in the morning to consider the Co-Chairs'  draft text. Discussions focused on whether to 'welcome' or 'note'  the report, the maturity of carbon dioxide capture and storage  systems and components, and the organization of a workshop,  including whether it should be sessional or intersessional and its  main objective. In the afternoon, the contact group met and agreed  on a paragraph on dissemination of the report. Discussions  continued until 11:55 pm and no agreement was reached. The contact  group will resume on Saturday.

### LDCS

The contact group met to consider a revised draft decision  on the mandate of the Least Developed Countries Expert Group  (LEG). Discussions focused on a paragraph requesting the LEG to  develop a work programme for consideration by SBI. SAMOA, for LDCs  and supported by others, suggested deleting reference to SBI,  while AUSTRALIA, supported by the EU, emphasized the need to be  clear on implications of the decision and consider LEG's detailed  needs at the SBI. After informal consultations Parties reached  consensus on a new formulation including reference to SBI and  decided to refer the text to the COP for adoption.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Implications of the CDM for Other  Environmental Treaties: Chair Børsting presented a draft COP/MOP  decision on implications of the establishment of HCFC-22  facilities seeking to obtain CERs for the destruction of HFC-23.  CHINA and CANADA objected to text on the potentially negative  impacts of establishing new HCFC-22 facilities, with CHINA  questioning the scientific basis of some of the assertions. Noting  increased demand for HCFC-22, CHINA stressed the need for  incentives to destroy HFC-23. CANADA, supported by JAPAN,  emphasized that HCFC-22 for feedstock applications is not  restricted under the Montreal Protocol and urged making that  distinction. BRAZIL proposed to treat increased HCFC-22 production  as leakage. Chair Børsting will consult informally.

### MITIGATION

Delegates worked through the text paragraph-by- paragraph, focusing on language dealing with workshops on  mitigation practices and technologies, a technical paper for the  workshops and workshop reporting, as well as next steps for this  agenda item. On the workshop format, the US proposed holding an  informal, in-session workshop. AUSTRALIA, CANADA and NORWAY  suggested holding four workshops. The G-77/CHINA expressed  reservations on requesting a Secretariat's technical paper. No  agreement was reached on any of these issues. Discussions will  continue informally.

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Delegates met informally in  the morning and afternoon, approving the text after a paragraph- by-paragraph discussion. Parties covered terrestrial observation,  oceanic observation, cooperation between the Group on Earth  Observations (GEO) and GCOS, national focal points, and capacity  building. A contact group will meet to formalize the agreement.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Participants engaged in a paragraph-by- paragraph discussion of the draft text. On EGTT's 2006 Work  Programme, delegates agreed to all text, including language on  nominations and a special working session, with the exception of a  paragraph on public technologies. Delegates also discussed draft  text on the framework for implementation. Discussions continued  informally in the afternoon, although limited progress was  reported.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Much of the gossip on Friday evening was over a high-level meeting  COP President Dion held with representatives of each of the major  negotiating groups. Apparently, Dion presented a non-paper on an  approach to considering future scenarios under the Convention.  This approach, which is different to treating future commitments  under Protocol Article 3.9, is likely to fuel considerable debate.  The initial response was mixed, with enthusiasm in some quarters  but a more muted response in others. 'This could potentially be  the big outcome of the meeting, but it will be a complicated task'  observed one delegate.

Meanwhile, the contact groups were rather less sensational. While  a few agreements were reached on issues such as UNFCCC Article 6,  the LDC Expert Group and Annex I communications, efforts to grind  out results in many other groups were far less successful. As of  Friday night, some participants were expressing concerns at a lack  of movement on financial issues, compliance, mitigation, and  implications of the CDM for other environmental treaties. 'If this  was a race, the snail would have beaten us today,' said one  delegate. However, a veteran negotiator noted that the pace always  seems to slow at this time of the meeting.

Perhaps in recognition of the heavy workload, Saturday's daily  programme has meetings scheduled into the evening. 'This could  upset some people's plans to attend the NGO party or the Montreal  Canadiens' ice hockey game,' joked one participant.
