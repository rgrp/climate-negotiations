# SBI 30

## NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS:

### Consultative Group of Experts on Non-Annex I National Communications (CGE)

In the morning and afternoon, delegates met in informal consultations and a contact group. Discussions focused on whether to have a reconstituted CGE for two or three years, and when to have a review of the CGE. Brazil, for the G-77/CHINA, supported by the US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and NORWAY, proposed: reconstituting the CGE for a period of three years; deleting text that the CGE s activities and mandate end in December 2011, unless the COP decides otherwise; and that the term and mandate of the CGE and the need for continuation of the CGE shall be reviewed by COP 17. After further consultations, the EU also agreed to join the consensus. During the closing SBI plenary, delegates adopted the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.3/Rev.1). The G-77/CHINA said that while time lost without the CGE cannot be recuperated, he was happy that agreement had finally been reached. The EU, US, CANADA and others also expressed satisfaction at the CGE s reconstitution.

###     Financial and technical support

The SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.12). The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that the reallocation of remaining GEF resources would undermine the preparation of non-Annex I national communications, and said he expected the GEF to report to the next COP, inter alia , on procedures that implementing agencies have put in place to assist countries in this regard.

### The SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.8).

CAPACITY BUILDING (CONVENTION)

Noting the hard work undertaken by the contact group, Co-Chair Gwage regretted that the group was not able to reach consensus on either a COP decision or SBI conclusions on the second comprehensive review of the capacity building framework. He cited lack of time to complete the work. Consideration of the issue will continue at SBI 31.

## COMPLIANCE:

The SBI will continue consideration of this issue at SBI 32.

## ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS:

In a morning contact group, parties considered draft SBI conclusions. Parties agreed on text concerning, inter alia , a three-day high-level segment in Copenhagen. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed stronger language stating that meetings shall end by 6 pm, and by 8 pm in exceptional circumstances. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION opposed reference to meetings ending by 9 pm. Divergent views remained and the contact group forwarded the draft conclusions to the SBI closing plenary with this reference in brackets. During the SBI closing plenary, Co-Chair Muyungi reported that parties had been unable to reach conclusions on: when the AWGs should report to the COP and COP/MOP plenaries; scheduling of SB 31; and the duration of meeting time. After brief informal consultations concerning the duration of meeting time, Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, reported that agreement had been reached on language stating that all meetings end by 6 pm, but may, in exceptional circumstances and on a case by case basis, continue for two to three hours. The SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.10).

## ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS:

The SBI adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.7) as amended.

## REPORT OF THE SESSION:

Parties adopted the meeting s report (FCCC/SBI/2009/L.1).

## CLOSING STATEMENTS:

Sudan, for the G-77/CHINA, expressed concern with the lack of progress on issues such as capacity building under the Convention and the Protocol, welcomed agreement on the CGE, and expressed hope that more work would be done at SBI 31 on decision 1/CP.10 (Buenos Aires Programme of Work). Many parties expressed disappointment with the lack of progress on the second comprehensive review of the capacity building framework. Grenada, for AOSIS, welcomed the renewal of the CGE s mandate. On the financial mechanism, she expressed appreciation to the GEF for support to non-Annex I parties in preparing their national communications, but called for increased funding for subsequent national communications. Lesotho, for LDCs, underscored the need for the full implementation of the LDC work programme, including NAPAs.

SBI Chair Bratasida closed the session at 10:54 pm.

# AWG-LCA INFORMAL PLENARY

## TECHNOLOGY:

The AWG-LCA informal plenary convened in the morning to continue considering the draft negotiating text. AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar introduced the revised text on technology and capacity building, which, inter alia, incorporates new textual proposals received from parties, and includes brackets around text that parties proposed deleting during the first reading. The second reading of the text on technology and capacity building then commenced. Some parties proposed detailed additions to the text, and other parties proposed corrections to ensure that their proposals were properly reflected in the text. AWG-LCA Chair Zammit Cutajar recommended that parties email detailed changes to the Secretariat. He reminded parties that all textual proposals on finance and mitigation should be submitted for discussions on Thursday and Friday.

JAPAN announced a mid-term emission reduction target of 15% from 2005 levels by 2020.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

## OTHER ISSUES (AWG-KP)

The contact group convened briefly in the afternoon. AWG-KP Vice-Chair Dovland presented a non-paper reflecting the results of the group s work, including the spin-off group on LULUCF, and said he would submit the paper to the AWG-KP Chair.

ANNEX I EMISSION REDUCTIONS (AWG-KP): Parties met informally in the morning and afternoon to discuss Annex I parties emission reductions beyond 2012. Discussions focused on whether to reflect proposals for Annex I parties individual targets in the Co-Chairs non-paper. Some developed countries expressed preference for not including numbers for individual countries, while others said if numbers were to be included, these should only be those proposed by the relevant parties themselves. Developing countries stressed the need to reflect the proposals for individual targets in the paper. Divergent views remained and discussions will continue.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

On Wednesday, the corridors and meeting rooms were once again busy with delegates attempting to complete work under the SBs. Throughout the day, informal consultations were held to finalize outstanding items, such as financial issues and arrangements for intergovernmental meetings. Agreement was eventually reached on all issues if not in substantive terms, then at least concerning the process forward. Delegates seemed reasonably pleased with many of the outcomes, including the agreement to reconstitute the Consultative Group of Experts on Non-Annex I National Communications. However, the evening ended up being long for those following the SBI, as the closing plenary concluded just before 11 pm. As the SBs gradually wrapped up, all eyes started shifting towards the AWGs. With textual proposals on mitigation and finance due under the AWG-LCA, the Secretariat was anticipating another all-nighter to incorporate the proposals in the draft negotiating text in time for the plenary discussions on Thursday. While the AWG-KP contact group on other issues was able to wrap up its work and submit text to the AWG-KP Chair, informal consultations on emission reductions continued throughout the day with little progress reported. Some anticipated that the real battle over the AWG-KP conclusions was to come over the next two days. I m not sure whether there will be a collective decision by the parties to circulate text on proposed amendments to the Protocol or whether we will end up with several parties submitting their individual amendment proposals, commented one veteran. Being a great fan of the Protocol myself, I m worried about its future, he added. We ll start Thursday with informal consultations on the AWG-KP conclusions and that s when the rubber will really hit the road, commented another seasoned negotiator on things to come.
