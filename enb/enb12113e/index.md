# PLENARY

COP-4 President Maria Julia Alsogaray welcomed delegates to COP-5.  She said the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA) had generated new  momentum and stressed the need for political will to fulfill the  BAPA and allow for the Protocol to enter into force by Rio+10 in  2002.

Jan Szyszko, Minister of Environmental Protection, Natural  Resources and Forestry, Poland, was elected President of COP-5. He  said the operation of the flexibility mechanisms, compliance and  guidance on the COP acting as the Meeting of the Parties to the  Protocol should be settled by COP-6. He referred to concerns by  some developing countries on the Protocol's impact on their  development efforts and noted the need to find alternatives that  lower implementation-related costs for developing countries.

Gerhard Schr√∂der, Federal Chancellor of Germany, said the vision  for sustainable development articulated at the Rio Summit had not  become a reality as quickly as hoped. He noted that, despite the  establishment of the FCCC, there had been setbacks in the climate  process, including the inability of most industrialized countries  to reduce their CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2000. He  outlined Germany's efforts to reduce GHG emissions, including a  reduction target it had set itself of 17% by 2005 and an 'eco-tax'  that raises energy consumption costs. He said the Protocol should  enter into force by 2002 and urged Parties to implement their  pledges in international fora.

FCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit-Cutajar, on behalf of Kofi  Annan, UN Secretary General, stressed the need for urgent action  if the Kyoto commitments were to be met. He called for sensitivity  to the needs of vulnerable countries and financial empowerment of  developing countries. Assuring the COP of UN support , he said the  global community wished to see the CDM activated after COP-6 and  the Protocol ratified by 2002.

On organizational matters, the COP adopted the agenda, with the  exception of Agenda Item 5, as consensus had not been reached on a  G-77/China proposal to amend the item to read 'Review of the  adequacy of implementation of Articles 4.2 (a) and (b) of the  FCCC' (policies and measures by Annex I Parties), rather than  'Second Review of the adequacy' of these articles.

The COP elected its Bureau members. The Vice-Presidents elected  were: Papa Cham (The Gambia), Phillip Gwage (Uganda), Mohamed Al- Sabban (Saudi Arabia), Liu Zhenmin (China), Olexander Bielov  (Ukraine), Yvo De Boer (Netherlands), Neroni Slade (Samoa). The  COP elected Antonio Vallini Guerreiro (Brazil) as Rapporteur, John  Ashe (Antigua & Barbuda) as Chair of SBI and Harald Dovland  (Norway) as Chair of SBSTA. Delegates then adopted the proposed  organization of work for COP-5.

On administrative and financial matters, the COP adopted a draft  decision stating that the institutional linkage of the FCCC  Secretariat to the UN will be continued. Delegates agreed to  President Szyszko's proposal to continue consultations on the  constitution of the proposed Multilateral Consultative Committee.

# SBI

SBI Chair John Ashe introduced Vice Chair Mohammed Reza Salamat  (Iran) and Rapporteur Klaus Radunsky (Austria). The provisional  agenda was adopted as amended by the Plenary.

On Annex I communications, the US recommended that only Part I  (general description of guidelines) be negotiated through a  contact group and adopted during COP-5. SWITZERLAND, with the EU  and AUSTRALIA, supported adopting the guidelines at COP-5.  AUSTRALIA said the guidelines may be applicable to Protocol  inventories.

SBI discussed the first synthesis report of non-Annex I initial  communications. On obstacles to producing non-Annex I  communications, the G-77/CHINA called for provision of adequate  financial resources, technical assistance and capacity-building to  support non-Annex I countries in collecting data and identifying  national emission factors and methodologies for adaptation  assessment. The EU, opposed by CHINA, said the GEF had provided  most non-Annex I Parties with funding for national communications.  UZBEKISTAN noted that constraints included lack of research and  data on emissions factors. IRAN noted that countries also have  needs determined by their unique circumstances.

On the advantages of producing non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA said that despite difficulties in identifying significant  trends, the synthesis of initial non-Annex I communications was a  first step in considering information related to FCCC  implementation by non-Annex I Parties. The EU, CANADA and  MICRONESIA noted the usefulness of the compilation and synthesis  report in better understanding the difficulties faced by non-Annex  I Parties.

On guidelines for non-Annex I communications, the G-77/CHINA  opposed changing the guidelines, as many non-Annex I countries  have not finalized their first communications. AOSIS noted the  need to modify IPCC guidelines for small island developing states  because they are not always applicable to their special  circumstances. Since many countries had expressed an interest in  initiating second national communications, the EU said guidelines  should be reviewed. SWITZERLAND said there is a need for one  unified reporting format for all FCCC Parties and for the use of  IPCC guidelines.

The G-77/CHINA called for an expert review of non-Annex I  communications by non-Annex I Party experts. The EU and others  highlighted the need for an expert review and consideration of  non-Annex I communications and said all countries could benefit  from this exercise. AOSIS opposed technical assessment processes  for individual national communications. ARGENTINA supported  regional groups of experts. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA added that  expert review teams should focus on identifying solutions to  obstacles in preparing communications and sharing experiences.

On the timing of second national communications, the G-77/CHINA  noted that there is a differentiated timetable under the FCCC for  submission of national communications by Annex I and non-Annex I  Parties. She said submissions of non-Annex I Parties'  communications were contingent on the availability of financial  resources. The US, supported by CANADA and SWITZERLAND and opposed  by CHINA, said the revision of guidelines was fundamental to  improving second national communications. A contact group will be  convened on non-Annex I communications.

# SBSTA

Delegates adopted the agenda, as amended by the COP Plenary, and  the organization of work. Lambert Gnapelet (Central African  Republic) and Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia) were re-elected as SBSTA  Vice-Chair and Rapporteur respectively.

On cooperation with relevant scientific organizations, Robert  Watson, Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), reported on progress on the Third Assessment Report (TAR)  and three special reports on technology transfer, emissions  scenarios of GHGs and aerosol precursors, and LULUCF. He  highlighted IPCC's budgetary constraints due to the large number  of special reports, the enhanced regional emphasis and increased  participation of experts from developing countries and countries  with economies in transition. He expressed concern over the poor  financial response from the majority of governments and urged  Parties to resolve this issue.

On Annex I communications, the EU noted the need to include  indicators such as emissions per capita or emissions per unit of  output. Regarding the draft guidance for reporting on Global  Climate Observation Systems (GCOS), the EU, with MONGOLIA,  recommended that Annex I Parties prepare separate reports on  global climate observation and include in their national  communications a summary based on general reporting requirements.  AUSTRALIA suggested that projections of the effect of policies and  measures on future trends of GHG emissions and removals be  developed by sector. The MARSHALL ISLANDS and JAMAICA supported  detailed and rigorous reporting. The US said the quantity and  level of detail should balance needs for comparability,  transparency and practicality. A contact group chaired by Jim  Penman (UK) and Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania) will meet to consider  this issue.

On LULUCF, Watson presented provisional findings from the Special  Report on LULUCF. He said key decisions should be made with  respect to definitions, the accounting system, monitoring and  reporting systems and inventory guidelines, before the Protocol  could be implemented. The G-77/CHINA said any consideration of the  LULUCF process should begin after the release of the IPCC Special  Report.  JAPAN, with AUSTRALIA, called for the establishment of a  decision-making framework at COP-5. AUSTRALIA stressed that the  key question is not 'whether' but 'how' additional sink activities  could be included in the Protocol. CANADA said the decision-making  framework should be based on consistency between the provisions of  the Kyoto Protocol.

Regarding additional activities, the US said there should be  transparency in reporting and verifiability. According to the EU,  the IPCC Special Report and country specific data should provide  the basis for future discussions and decisions. A contact group  will consider this issue further.

On national systems, adjustments and guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5 (methodology), 7 (communications) and 8 (review of  information), Taka Hiraishi, Vice-Chair, IPCC Inventories Task  Force, reported on the work being undertaken on uncertainties and  good practice in inventory preparation.

Regarding guidelines for national systems, the EU, with JAPAN,  said they should be flexible in order to reflect different  national circumstances. The US highlighted the incorporation of  IPCC good practice guidance. AUSTRALIA proposed including, inter  alia, quality assurance and quality control procedures, links  between national systems and emissions trading systems and links  with the transfer and acquisition of assigned amounts. SWITZERLAND  said guidelines should include criteria for national enforcement  systems to comply with relevant guidelines, and the establishment  and treatment of data related to Protocol mechanisms.

Regarding adjustments, AUSTRALIA said they are intended as an  element of the Protocol's compliance system. The EU and JAPAN  stated that further discussion on technical aspects should only  occur after the completion of IPCC's work on good practice. CANADA  noted the lack of clarity in what an adjustment would be. With NEW  ZEALAND, he expressed support for a technical review process of  inventories, noting that this is fundamental to the development of  an adjustment process. Helen Plume (New Zealand) will conduct  informal consultations.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

An unexpected delay in Monday morning's Plenary led to expressions  of pessimism by some participants at what can be expected from  COP-5. Some said the failure by the G-77/China and the EU to agree  on a proposed reformulation of an agenda item on the review of  adequacy of commitments served as a telling reminder of the  persistently contentious issues that can be expected to feature  during the next two weeks.
