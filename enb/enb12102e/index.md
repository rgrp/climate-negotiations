# SBSTA

On LULUCF, NORWAY said SBSTA-10 can make progress on policy and  procedural issues and guide IPCC with its preparation of a Special  Report on LULUCF. AUSTRALIA called for focus on key policy and  procedural issues relevant to the negotiating process, and for  clarification of the Protocol's reference to establishing 1990  carbon stock levels. The EU called for clear definitions of terms  and for work on the eligibility of additional activities between  now and COP-6.

NEW ZEALAND urged SBSTA to adopt a long term approach and further  consider treatment of harvested wood products. The US stressed  making timely decisions on LULUCF. NIGERIA said the Special Report  should include definitions of baselines for carbon stocks in sinks  and should ensure that policy options are consistent with other  convention requirements. SAUDI ARABIA, SWITZERLAND, GREENPEACE and  others expressed reservations about the proposed timing for  deliberation on some issues, noting the relevance of the Special  Report.

On emissions resulting from fuel used for international  transportation, the Secretariat reported that the International  Maritime Organization (IMO) is currently considering a study on  emissions from ships to develop an internationally accepted policy  document. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)  presented an overview of technology and standards, operational  measures and market-based options aimed at providing a technical  and policy basis for decisions to limit bunker emissions.  SWITZERLAND stressed the need to introduce more stringent  regulations, improve air traffic management nationally and  internationally and use economic instruments such as eliminating  tax privileges on aviation fuel. SAUDI ARABIA said the use of  market-based mechanisms would burden developing countries.

On reporting of bunker emissions, the EU proposed that any  decision on their inclusion in national inventories should be  applied in the second commitment period. The US preferred treating  bunker emissions separately from national inventories, which the  EU said results in no direct incentives to limit or reduce bunker  emissions. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA called for further clarification  in defining international bunker fuels.

On allocation of bunker emissions, AUSTRALIA highlighted the need  to establish a policy framework and adopt the most suitable method  of recording emissions. Stating that this is a complicated  process, JAPAN called on ICAO and IMO to provide necessary  information to help identify possible solutions. The EU said it  would be practical to include bunker fuel emissions in inventories  of Parties where the fuel is sold. Chair Chow proposed drafting  conclusions on this matter.

Regarding information on impacts, adaptation and mitigation  assessment methods, UNEP reported on its recent work on  methodologies, including provision of guidance for national  strategy development and capacity building on GHG abatement.  TANZANIA suggested establishing FCCC collaborating centers in  developing countries for information purposes and capacity  building. UGANDA supported regional capacity building and South- South sharing of expertise.

On other matters, BRAZIL reported on a recent workshop held to  consider its proposal on determining responsibility based on  historical emissions. He noted that the proposal will be on SBSTA- 11's agenda. The IPCC reported on the status of the forthcoming  Special Report on Methodological and Technological Issues in  Technology Transfer that will present a broad conceptual framework  on the complex way technology transfer occurs and reflect the role  of governments and other stakeholders.

# SBI

On the program budget for the biennium 2000-2001, FCCC Executive  Secretary, introduced the documents FCCC/SBI/1999/4 and  FCCC/SBI/1999/4/Add.1. He highlighted its new features, inter  alia, a cross-cutting emphasis on capacity building and strong  focus on ensuring high quality of inventory data. He said the  budget also seeks to strengthen capacity within the Secretariat to  enable it to respond effectively to Parties' demands. He informed  delegates of a 50% increase in the budget for programme  activities. Chair Kante initially sought to confine discussion to  consultations to be led by Mohamed Mahmoud Ould El Ghaouth  (Mauritania) but at the insistence of CHINA, the PHILIPPINES,  SAUDI ARABIA and INDIA, allowed Parties to make general statements  in Plenary. The PHILIPPINES stressed that capacity building was  for developing countries not for the Secretariat. IRAN, with  CHINA, BRAZIL, SAUDI ARABIA, INDIA and the PHILIPPINES expressed  concern over a steep increase in the proposed budget's expenditure  levels.

On income and budget performance in the biennium 1998-1999, the EU  called for timely payment of contributions. The PHILIPPINES noted  that developing countries were penalized for arrears in their  contributions by being denied the benefit of the trust fund for  participation and inquired whether similar penalties existed for  Annex I countries. The EU said options to deal with cash surpluses  and carry-over of resources from previous biennium periods  required further consideration.  SWITZERLAND asked why there were  unspent reserves. JAPAN said it preferred repayment to the  Parties.

On the institutional linkage of the Convention Secretariat to the  United Nations, the FCCC Executive Secretary said the  institutional linkage was working well. The G-77/CHINA accepted  the document. The EU said its experiences with the linkage were  positive and welcomed its continuation. The US queried whether  maintenance of the institutional linkage was part of the problem  with respect to financing of conference services. The Executive  Secretary suggested that this issue be discussed by the contact  group on the budget. Chair Kante proposed drafting a decision on  the issue.

On annual inventories of national greenhouse gas data from Annex I  Parties, the EU called for a single document containing all  available data from Annex I Parties and urged Parties that had not  done so to submit their inventories. The US underscored the  importance of good quality reports and questioned the delay in  submission of Annex I inventories.

On reporting on technology transfer and financial assistance,  CANADA, with the US, said exhaustive reporting on all areas  related to climate change, including reporting on private and  public technology transfer, is impractical and beyond the means of  most Parties' budgets. On the future review process, the US said  the review process under the FCCC and the review of implementation  under Article 8 of the Protocol are fundamentally different. The  EU noted that work should first be undertaken to develop the  review for inventories and then guidelines developed for the  review process under the Convention and the Protocol.

# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

The Joint Working Group (JWG) on procedures and mechanisms  relating to compliance under the Protocol, co-chaired by Harald  Dovland (Norway) and Espen Rønnenberg (Marshall Islands),  considered a compilation of submissions from Parties  (FCCC/SB/1999/MISC.4, Adds. 1 and 2, FCCC/SB/1999/CRP.1).

On the proposed agenda, the G-77/CHINA called for a discussion on  the basic principles for a compliance regime. She noted a lack of  submissions received from developing countries and, with KENYA,  supported compiling views through a questionnaire. SAUDI ARABIA  emphasized that many countries were not ready for discussion on  elements or defining the programme of work. AOSIS acknowledged the  utility of discussing principles, but was ready to work on the  basis of the Secretariat's synthesis of submissions. CHINA  supported including a section on basic principles, particularly on  common but differentiated responsibilities. He said the  Multilateral Consultative Process (MCP) could play an important  role.

The EU said the working group should identify the compliance- related elements under the Protocol, define the work programme,  and identify linkages to other groups. With SWITZERLAND, he called  for a draft negotiating text by COP-5. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA said  the facilitative and punitive aspects of taking measures against  non-compliance should be incorporated in a balanced way. CANADA  said the first task is stocktaking of the compliance-related  elements and, with NEW ZEALAND and the US, underscored the  importance of tracking other groups' work. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK  proposed that Parties request a synthesis of compliance-related  work being done in other groups or request a workshop that  addresses the full range of compliance issues. JAPAN highlighted  the importance of examining other multilateral environmental  agreements. RUSSIA called for a well-defined legal interpretation  of compliance. The US cautioned against postponing substantive  discussion until the proposed questionnaire was completed.

Chair Rønnenberg outlined the elements of JWG's provisional  agenda, including identification of compliance-related elements,  objectives and nature of a comprehensive compliance system, design  of a compliance system and consequences of non-compliance. CHINA  proposed including a reference to 'principles' in the agenda.  After extensive debate, Parties deleted the item on objectives and  nature and added a new sub-item on 'other elements as identified  in Decision 8/CP.4 and in the progress of work' to ensure that the  Agenda was not 'set in stone.' On identification of compliance-related elements and gaps, the US,  with CANADA and the EU, indicated the need to differentiate  elements from gaps and proposed three categories to identify them:  substantive rules; procedures for addressing compliance; and  consequences of non-compliance. She noted gaps were identifiable  for procedures and consequences of non-compliance other than for  substantive rules. UNITED ARAB EMIRATES said these were not yet  identifiable because mechanisms' operation was still under  discussion. AOSIS cautioned against making a 'crude' distinction  between substance and procedure. JAPAN noted that although expert  review teams were useful in assessing implementation, determining  non-compliance was not within their mandate. On modalities for  inter-linkage, the US noted the need to link Articles 5 (national  system to estimate emissions), 7 (communication of information), 6  (joint implementation), 12 (CDM) and 17 (emissions trading) to  compliance because the first two are means to assess conformity  with assigned amounts and the last three are means to meet  commitments. AUSTRALIA and other delegations noted the need for  continuous feedback between the JWG and other contact groups to  avoid overlap and contradictions on substantive rules.

# CONTACT GROUPS

The contact group chaired by Paul Maclons (South Africa) and  Maciej Sadowski (Poland) met in the evening to consider LULUCF  issues, including policy and procedural matters and data to  establish 1990 carbon stock levels. Participants agreed to  continue their discussions, recognizing that many decisions must  await SBSTA's consideration of the relevant IPCC Special Report  due in May 2000. A contact group co-chaired by Jim Penman (UK) and  Mark Mwandosya (Tanzania) met in the afternoon to consider text on  draft guidelines for the preparation of Annex I communications.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some observers reported rumblings beneath the meeting's seemingly  placid surface. Temperatures rose at a meeting of the European  Commission and NGOs. The EU delegates felt stung by NGO critiques  of the EU formula to establish a ceiling on the use of the  mechanisms by Annex B Parties. One calculation suggested the  formula would result in the EU using the mechanisms to meet at  least 65% of their own commitments. However, others still consider  the EU proposal a progressive step.
