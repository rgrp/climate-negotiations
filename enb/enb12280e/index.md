At COP/MOP 1, Parties are expected to discuss and adopt decisions  on the outstanding operational details of the Protocol, including  procedures relating to compliance and guidelines for the 'flexible  mechanisms' intended to help Parties reach their emissions  targets. Discussions on the mechanisms will cover issues such as  the supervisory committee of the Joint Implementation mechanism,  and recommendations by the Executive Board of the Clean  Development Mechanism. Other issues on the COP/MOP agenda include  the Adaptation Fund and future commitments for the period after  2012 (when the Protocol's first commitment period ends). Various  methodological, administrative, financial and institutional  matters will also be addressed.

COP 11's agenda includes items on capacity building and technology  transfer, the adverse effects of climate change on developing and  least developed countries, and several financial and budget  related issues, including the report of the Global Environment  Facility (which serves as the treaty's financial mechanism). The  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies will also meet, from 29 November to 6  December. The joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment will take  place from 7-9 December.

In addition to these meetings, over 140 'side events' will be held  on a range of climate change topics. There will also be several  major 'parallel events' organized with assistance from the host  government, as well as numerous other climate and energy-related  exhibits, displays, launches and initiatives.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats  to sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on the  environment, human health, food security, economic activity,  natural resources and physical infrastructure. Global climate  varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations  of anthropogenically-produced greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and scientific findings  indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 189 Parties. The Parties to the UNFCCC typically convene  annually in a Conference of the Parties (COP), and twice a year in  meetings of the subsidiary bodies - the Subsidiary Body for  Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and  Technological Advice (SBSTA).

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In December 1997, delegates at COP 3 in Kyoto,  Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  to achieve emissions reduction targets. These countries, known  under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their  overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2%  below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period),  with specific targets varying from country to country. The  Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms to assist  Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost- effectively: an emissions trading system; joint implementation  (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and  the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows for emissions  reduction projects to be implemented in non-Annex I Parties.  Following COP 3, Parties began negotiating many of the rules and  operational details governing how countries will reduce emissions  and measure their emissions reductions. To date, 157 Parties have  ratified the Kyoto Protocol, including 37 Annex I Parties  representing 61.6% of 1990 Annex I greenhouse gas emissions. The  Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005.

### BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

The process for finalizing the rules  and operational details of the Protocol was agreed at COP 4 in  1998 in a document known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. The  Plan set COP 6 as the deadline for finalizing these rules and  operational details and strengthening implementation of the  UNFCCC. In November 2000, Parties met at COP 6 in The Hague, the  Netherlands, to complete these negotiations. They were not  successful and delegates suspended COP 6 until July 2001 when it  reconvened in Bonn, Germany. After further talks, delegates  eventually agreed to adopt a political decision, the Bonn  Agreements. While this decision provided high-level political  direction on the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, delegates  were still unable to finalize text on some issues, and agreed to  forward all the draft decisions to COP 7 for final resolution.

### MARRAKESH ACCORDS

In late October and early November 2001 at COP  7, delegates resumed their discussions and reached agreement on  the Marrakesh Accords. These Accords consist of a package of draft  decisions on many of the details of the flexible mechanisms, land  use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) and compliance with the  Kyoto Protocol that should be adopted by the COP/MOP. The Accords  also address support for developing countries, including capacity  building, technology transfer, responding to the adverse effects  of climate change, and the establishment of three funds - the  Least Developed Countries (LDC) Fund, Special Climate Change Fund  (SCCF), and Adaptation Fund.

Delegates sought to build on the Marrakesh Accords at COP 8 and  COP 9, agreeing on rules and procedures for the CDM Executive  Board, and on modalities and procedures for afforestation and  reforestation project activities under the CDM. Parties also  discussed how to integrate findings of the IPCC's Third  Assessment Report into the work of the UNFCCC, and agreed on two  new agenda items focused on adaptation and mitigation.

### COP 10

At COP 10 in Buenos Aires in December 2004, delegates  agreed to the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and  Response Measures. Parties also took decisions on technology  transfer, LULUCF, the UNFCCC's financial mechanism, and education,  training and public awareness. However, some issues remained  unresolved, including items on the LDC Fund, the SCCF, and  Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures).  Meanwhile, lengthy negotiations were held on the complex and  sensitive issue of how Parties might engage on commitments to  combat climate change in the post-2012 period. The Kyoto Protocol  requires Parties to begin considering the post-2012 period by  2005. Delegates agreed to hold a Seminar of Governmental Experts  prior to SB 22 in May 2005, although the terms of reference for  the Seminar did not refer specifically to the post-2012 period or  new commitments.

# SEMINAR OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS AND

### SB 22

This seminar took place in May 2005, in Bonn. Delegates  started to address some of the broader issues facing the climate  change process, including a future framework and commitments  beyond 2012. Immediately following the seminar, the twenty-second  sessions of the subsidiary bodies (SB 22) convened. These focused  on preparations for COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, and addressed a variety  of issues ranging from budget matters to adaptation and  mitigation. Delegates provisionally agreed on a programme budget  for 2006-2007 at a level that was US$1.75 million less than had  been proposed. However, work on the SCCF was not concluded.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### G8 MEETING AND MINISTERIAL DIALOGUE

On 8 July 2005, leaders  attending the G8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, agreed to a  communiqué recognizing humanity's serious impact on climate change  and making a commitment to promote innovation, energy efficiency,  conservation and cleaner technologies. Participants also agreed to  proceed with a 'Dialogue on Climate Change, Clean Energy and  Sustainable Development.' The first ministerial dialogue was held  in London, UK, on 1 November 2005. It was attended by energy and  environment ministers from 20 countries, who focused on energy  technologies and steps to achieve a low-carbon economy. According  to some reports, the focus on technological solutions and private  sector involvement reflected recent efforts by the EU, US and  other large economies to find common ground in spite of  differences over the binding targets set out under the Kyoto  Protocol. The London dialogue followed an informal ministerial  meeting in Greenland in mid-August designed to discuss policy  differences among several key countries.

### ASIA-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP ON CLEAN DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE

On  28 July, a new six-country partnership was announced to combat  climate change through technology-based solutions. This agreement  was announced by Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and  the United States. The first meeting of the partnership is  expected in early 2006.

### 2005 WORLD SUMMIT

The 2005 World Summit, held at UN headquarters  in New York from 14-16 September, gave some consideration to  climate change. The Summit's outcome document highlights  countries' commitments and obligations under the UNFCCC and Kyoto  Protocol, stressing the need to act with 'resolve and urgency' to  address the many challenges faced in tackling climate change,  promoting clean energy, meeting energy needs and achieving  sustainable development. The outcome document supports the need to  work expeditiously to establish a worldwide early warning system  for natural hazards and articulates an agreement to speed up the  transfer of affordable and cleaner energy efficiency and  conservation technologies to developing countries 'on favourable  terms.' The impact of energy services on poverty is also clearly  stated.

### GEF REPLENISHMENT

The final scheduled meeting for the fourth  replenishment of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Trust Fund  took place on 21 and 22 November, in Tokyo, Japan. However, the  contributing participants were unable to reach agreement on  funding pledges, and it is expected that a further meeting will  convene in mid-December.

### UNFCCC MEETINGS

Various UNFCCC events have been held since SB 22,  including a workshop on the development of a five-year programme  of work on impacts, vulnerability and adaptation (17-19 October  2005, Bonn) and a seminar on the development and transfer of  environmentally sound technologies for adaptation (14-16 June  2005, Tobago). The UNFCCC has also held: a regional workshop for  Asia on education, training and public awareness under UNFCCC  Article 6 (11-15 September, Yokohama, Japan); a 'Hands-on Training  Workshop on Mitigation Assessments' (26-30 September, Seoul,  Republic of Korea); a meeting of the Least Developed Country  Expert Group (18-20 August, Kiribati); and a workshop on  innovative options for financing the results of technology needs  assessments (20-21 October, Bonn).

Several meetings have taken place in Montreal immediately prior to  COP 11 and COP/MOP 1. These include the 22nd meeting of the CDM  Executive Board (23-25 November), the fifth meeting of the  Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from  non-Annex I Parties (24-25 November), an Expert Meeting on  Response Measures (23-24 November), and a meeting of the Expert  Group on Technology Transfer (23-25 November).
