# IN THE BREEZEWAYS

Delegates were surprised at the relative speed with which the SCCF issue was concluded Tuesday and speculated that this might be linked to progress on the Adaptation Fund. Skeptics, however, recalled the climate process is in the habit of collecting empty funds. Nevertheless, with agreement on the majority of items under the financial mechanism, some delegates reportedly glimpsed the first steps in the confidence building process that will be required to pull together a post-2012 regime. Others observed the beginnings of attempts to tie up the Russian proposal, the AWG and the Article 9 review in a special Christmas package of negotiating opportunities and issue linkages. An Indian delegate caught the mood of negotiations on future commitments when he compared the long wait that will precede the unveiling of future Annex I commitments with marriage customs where the groom must await the wedding night before viewing the bride.
