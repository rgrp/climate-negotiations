# SBSTA

Recalling the outstanding appointment of co-chairs for the contact  group on P&Ms, Chair Benrageb said Anders Turesson (Sweden) and a  South African delegate would co-chair the group.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime transport: The International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO) reported on the 6th  meeting of the Committee  on Aviation Environmental Protection. CHINA called on ICAO and the  International Maritime Organization (IMO) to recognize the  differentiated obligations of Annex I and non-Annex I Parties.  JAPAN, SWITZERLAND, CANADA, the EU and US emphasized the  importance of cooperation between the UNFCCC, IPCC, ICAO and IMO.  The EU observed that IPCC methodologies for greenhouse gas  emissions estimates could be improved. SWITZERLAND cautioned  against lengthy and costly software development for emissions  estimation. BAHAMAS, for AOSIS, with CHINA, stressed developing  reporting methodologies. KENYA supported developing consistent  methodologies, inventories and emissions allocation. EGYPT noted  that emissions from aviation and maritime transport contribute to  ozone depletion and should be accounted for in national  inventories. TUVALU and KENYA, opposed by CANADA, said SBSTA  should broaden further guidance on the matter. Chair Benrageb said  Greg Terrill (Australia) would facilitate informal consultations.

### OTHER MATTERS

Issues relating to cleaner or less greenhouse  gas-emitting energy: CANADA, opposed by the EU, G-77/CHINA and  TUVALU, suggested taking note of its proposal to address the role  of trade and cleaner energy in meeting the objectives of the UNFCCC  and Protocol. Informal consultations, facilitated by Chair Benrageb,  will address the issue.

###     Issues relating to implementation of Protocol Article 2.3

The EU  said discussion on the matter should not be held prior to the  adoption of the draft COP/MOP decision on Protocol Article 3.14  (adverse effects). JAPAN preferred to continue discussing the  issue under the agenda item on other matters. Chair Benrageb said  he would conduct informal consultations.

# SBI

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS: COP-10

SAUDI ARABIA,  for the G-77/China, supported by the US, questioned the inclusion  of UNFCCC Article 4.2(a) and (b) on the second review of the  adequacy of commitments in the proposed COP-10 agenda. The EU and  NORWAY supported its inclusion.

The US, REPUBLIC OF KOREA, AUSTRALIA and NORWAY supported the  themes proposed for the COP-10 high-level segment (HLS), with  minor changes. OMAN and VENEZUELA opposed the inclusion of the  theme on energy and climate change. Several Parties favored  holding the HLS during the second week of COP-10. The RUSSIAN  FEDERATION and BURKINA FASO urged the structure of the HLS to  allow for wide participation. Parties discussed various formats  for the HLS, including statements, and round-table and panel  discussions, to effectively mark the UNFCCC's tenth anniversary.  MAURITIUS hoped sufficient funds would be available to provide for  participation of LDC and SIDS delegates.

###     Future sessional periods and organization of the intergovernmental process

The US and REPUBLIC OF KOREA supported a multi-year  programme of work for the climate negotiations, and called for the  period between COPs to be extended. Supported by NORWAY and  MAURITIUS, the US suggested a workshop at COP-10 to discuss  possible formats for the climate process. The EU welcomed efforts  to rationalize the workload of the climate process, but, with  JAPAN and the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported annual COPs.

###     Arrangements for COP/MOP-1

The Executive Secretary noted that in  order for COP-10 to be COP/MOP-1, the necessary instrument of  ratification will need to be deposited by 7 September 2004. SAUDI  ARABIA said priority in negotiations should be given to  outstanding items. The EU said decision 17/CP.9 on arrangements  for COP/MOP-1 is sufficient and no adjustments are necessary at  this time.

###     Effective participation in the UNFCCC process

Parties commented  on procedures for admitting observers, options for NGO  participation, and how to respond to a request by the UN Permanent  Forum on Indigenous Issues to establish an ad hoc open-ended  working group on indigenous peoples and climate change. The US  said his delegation sought physical presence during meetings of  the CDM EB, but that this request was not reflected in the  document on effective participation in the UNFCCC process. SAUDI  ARABIA said the document should have considered effective  participation of Parties, not NGOs, and, for the G-77/China,  highlighted the lack of funding for non-Annex I Parties to attend  meetings. The EU and CANADA welcomed participation of NGOs and  indigenous peoples.

The UN PERMANENT FORUM ON INDIGENOUS ISSUES highlighted the role  of indigenous peoples in addressing climate change and expressed  interest in participating in UNFCCC meetings. TUVALU favored  exploring the establishment of the ad hoc working group and  suggested the identification of a focal point for indigenous  peoples within the Secretariat. BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY NGOS  cautioned against increasing the number of constituencies, holding  multi-stakeholder dialogues or establishing a forum for any single  constituency. CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK called for greater support  for southern NGOs. INDIGENOUS PEOPLES ORGANIZATIONS suggested that  the Permanent Forum be given advisory status to the SBI and SBSTA.  On membership in constituencies, the US raised concern regarding  the criteria for membership to the Research and Independent NGOs  (RINGOs). RINGOS said the intention of membership criteria is  simply to clarify how members are distinguished from other  constituencies.

Chair Stoycheva said a contact group chaired by Karsten Sach  (Germany) would be convened on arrangements for intergovernmental  meetings.

### CONTINUING REVIEW OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE SECRETARIAT

INDIA, for  the G-77/China, called for balanced geographical representation in  the UNFCCC Secretariat, neutrality in preparing documents, and  equity in the allocation of resources for issues concerning  developing and developed countries. The EU and CANADA expressed  satisfaction with the functioning of the Secretariat. Supporting  the G-77/China, SAUDI ARABIA requested the Secretariat to exercise  caution when making statements on behalf of the UNFCCC, and ensure  that views of all Parties are adequately reflected. The Executive  Secretary stressed that the Secretariat is committed to  transparency and equal representation, and welcomed feedback on  its functioning.

Chair Stoycheva said she would carry out informal consultations on  the matter.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### SMALL-SCALE A&R PROJECTS UNDER THE CDM

This contact group was  chaired by Thelma Krug (Brazil). Chair Krug proposed to base  discussion on the draft text in the technical paper on simplified  modalities and procedures. BRAZIL, for the G-77/China, asked for  time for regional consultations. Parties addressed bundling,  leakage, additionality, environmental and social impacts,  definitions of low-income communities, and monitoring.

On bundling, the EU and several Parties cautioned that larger  projects could be 'debundled' into smaller projects to take  advantage of simplified modalities. BOLIVIA supported bundling and  requested development of technical instruments to address this  matter. TUVALU requested bundled projects to be similar, to avoid  baseline inconsistencies.

On leakage, JAPAN, with CANADA and INDIA, opposed by TUVALU,  BRAZIL and the EU, supported exempting leakage because of  monitoring costs and the unlikelihood of major impact, given the  small size of projects. The EU suggested the option of an extra  percentage of additional removals to account for leakage.

On additionality, TUVALU and others stressed the importance of  accounting for additionality, with BRAZIL recalling that projects  imply emissions in Annex I Parties. BOLIVIA, BURKINA FASO and  CANADA suggested that the existing lack of incentives for  sustainable forestry and land management among low-income  communities in developing countries be sufficient proof of  additionality.

On environmental and social impacts, JAPAN stressed that impact  assessments should be at the request of host governments. CANADA,  supported by BOLIVIA, proposed community participation in impact  assessments. On the question of how to define low-income  communities, CHINA, with several Parties, said host countries  should determine this matter.

Delegates then discussed the use of GPG in monitoring small-scale  projects. BRAZIL and BURKINA FASO said project participants should  determine choice of monitoring guidelines, while the EU,  SWITZERLAND, and CHILE supported GPG as an efficient and  transparent basis for generic project monitoring.

### LULUCF GPG

This contact group was co-chaired by Audun Rosland  (Norway) and William Kojo Agymang-Bonsu (Ghana). Delegates heard a  presentation and engaged in a question and answer session with  IPCC GPG experts on reporting LULUCF activities under the  Protocol. Parties then addressed the draft LULUCF common reporting  format (CRF). The EU said the draft CRF should include guidance on  requirements for national inventories. CANADA, supported by  SWEDEN, proposed a trial period to test CRF tables. Delegates then  discussed the scope and terms of reference of the workshop  scheduled to be held in Lillehammer, Norway, in August 2004, on  harvested wood products (HWP).

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

This contact group was co-chaired by Kishan  Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) and Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia).  Many Parties said the EGTT's report of its fifth meeting forms a  good basis for discussion. AUSTRALIA and JAPAN stressed the need  to emphasize mitigation. SWITZERLAND, JAPAN, the US and GHANA, on  behalf of G-77/China, called for synergies with other processes.  SWITZERLAND, opposed by KOREA, emphasized demand-driven technology  transfer. The G-77/CHINA recommended holding additional regional  workshops to aid developing country Parties to finalize their  technology needs assessment reports and implement the assessments'  outcomes. He said the workshop on innovative financing for  technology development and transfer, scheduled for September 2004,  should, inter alia, identify activities to be funded. He suggested  that the EGTT address the development of endogenous technologies  and transfer of technologies that are in the public domain, and  review the effectiveness of 'push' factors in its 2005 work  programme. The EU, opposed by GHANA, said the EGTT's 2005 work  programme should be discussed at SBSTA-21.

The US encouraged Parties to post results of their technology  needs assessments onto TT:CLEAR. GHANA, supported by JAPAN, said  joint partnerships between developed and developing countries are  essential to overcome barriers posed by intellectual property  rights. GHANA suggested that not all EGTT meetings be held in  conjunction with sessions of the SBSTA or COP. The G-77/CHINA,  opposed by the US and JAPAN, suggested that the group draft a COP  decision. Co-Chair Kumarsingh said he would hold informal  consultations on the matter.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Delegates remained relaxed during the second day, as negotiations  moved to contact groups to discuss A&R, GPG and technology  transfer. The general sense was that most controversial issues and  political debates would be left to Buenos Aires. Elsewhere,  observers commented on the unexpected questioning of the  membership criteria and composition of RINGOs in the SBI Plenary  in the morning.
