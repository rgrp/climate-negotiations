# SBSTA

### ADAPTATION WORKSHOP

Philip Gwage (Uganda) and David Warrilow (UK)  co-chaired the in-session workshop, which addressed the  development of a SBSTA five-year work programme on adaptation, as  required by the Buenos Aires Programme on Adaptation (1/CP.10).

Delegates heard presentations from keynote speaker Ian Burton,  University of Toronto, and 15 country representatives. Many  presenters highlighted technology transfer for adaptation, sharing  methodologies, avoiding duplication of work, a sectoral focus,  regional monitoring centers, and integration with sustainable  development and poverty eradication.

Ian Burton noted that the aim of adaptation is to reduce present  and future losses. He underscored the adaptation deficit and noted  that, from a strictly economic perspective, developed and rapidly  developing countries will suffer most. He also emphasized the need  for a comprehensive, flexible, phased work programme with clear  objectives that considers specific issues such as adaptation  baselines and measurement of progress.

JAPAN stressed the need for international coordinated action for  both developed and developing countries. CHINA called for a  practical and substantial approach, proposing hands-on expert  meetings rather than more workshops. CANADA emphasized risk  assessment and management, and stressed the importance of engaging  both practitioners and policy makers. NEW ZEALAND suggested  inviting voluntary submissions on adaptive capacities in national  communications. The EU proposed maximizing synergies, promoting  linkages to mitigation and, with CANADA, a review of the programme  following publication of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. The US  suggested a review after five years.

ARGENTINA proposed clustering adaptation and response measures.  The RUSSIAN FEDERATION underscored the need for regional  adaptation, regional projections and observation systems. AOSIS  called for a specific programme for SIDS, consistent with the  Mauritius Strategy. SOUTH AFRICA supported a best practice  clearing house, rapid vulnerability assessments, and early warning  systems. SAUDI ARABIA highlighted UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol  commitments, and urged support for Parties vulnerable to the  impacts of response measures, especially oil-exporting developing  countries. Bangladesh, for LDCs, spoke about micro-insurance and  tools and methodologies to assist LDCs. AUSTRALIA called for  analysis of available tools and methods, and for targeted  workshops. SWITZERLAND proposed that the Secretariat maintain a  methodologies website.

Co-Chair Warrilow invited comments from the floor, with delegates  highlighting, inter alia, the need for: SBSTA's work programme to  provide added value; increased knowledge and awareness on climate  change impacts; financial resources for the work programme;  strengthened national and local adaptation institutions; economic  valuation of adaptation measures; linkages with the Adaptation  Fund; linkages to take advantage of experiences in adaptation to  other phenomena and climate variability; a differentiation of  adaptation from disaster response; bottom-up approaches; and tools  for rapid assessment and identification of critical thresholds. A  contact group will be established.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL MEETINGS

### INTERNAL REVIEW OF SECRETARIAT ACTIVITIES

Harald Dovland (Norway)  convened the first meeting of a contact group on the internal  review of the activities of the UNFCCC Secretariat. COP Secretary  Richard Kinley provided a summary of the Secretariat's report  (FCCC/SBI/2005/6). On the need for predictable funding for  operation and maintenance of information systems, Kinley  acknowledged US contributions to the Supplementary Fund but  explained the need for funding beyond the development phase. He  also explained the Secretariat's efforts to streamline fund  raising and communication across business areas. Responding to a  question from JAPAN, Kinley recalled some reluctance by Parties to  permit the Secretariat to collaborate with other agencies. The EU  supported the view that there is scope for productive  relationships between the Secretariat and other agencies. Chair  Dovland circulated draft conclusions for the SBI and COP 11 and  invited Parties to reconvene on Monday morning.

### SPECIAL CLIMATE CHANGE FUND

The SBI contact group on the SCCF  convened in the afternoon, with Co-Chair Ojoo-Massawa noting that  the aim was to finish negotiations on draft SBI conclusions for a  COP decision (FCCC/SBI/2004/L.25). SOUTH AFRICA, CANADA and  Portugal, for the EU, said the text provided a useful basis for  discussions. The EU said the two first operative paragraphs, on  activities supported by the SCCF, are key to a final agreement. He  said text on economic diversification would require further  clarification. An informal meeting will take place on Monday  afternoon.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Chair Sach convened  the contact group in the afternoon. Regarding the high-level  segment of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, Chair Sach and NORWAY recalled  the agreement at SB 18 on provision for high-level statements,  using one list of speakers. The US favoured an interactive  approach combined with statements.

On future sessional periods, Chair Sach noted an IPCC request for  a postponement of COP 13 by three to four weeks. AUSTRALIA, JAPAN,  INDIA, the EU and NEW ZEALAND supported the IPCC request. SAUDI  ARABIA and CHINA suggested that the IPCC Report could be taken up  at COP 14. On possible elements for the provisional COP 11 agenda,  Saudi Arabia, for the G-77/CHINA, asked that the agenda reflects  that an item on UNFCCC Article 4.8 (adverse effects) is part of a  review process and that an item on capacity building be added.

Regarding the negotiating process, Chair Sach noted views from the  SBI Plenary, including support for clustering or consolidating  agenda items, a reduction in the number of contact groups and  consultations, and some support for longer time-cycles for agenda  items. SAUDI ARABIA urged further discussion. NORWAY and CANADA  suggested that some recommendations on streamlining the process  could be implemented straight away. The EU noted a proposal to  continue considerations up to SBI 24. On observer participation,  Chair Sach recalled support for the Secretariat's views that  current UNFCCC practices are in line with ongoing reflections at  the UN General Assembly. Chair Sach undertook to draft conclusions  for Monday morning and reconvene the contact group on Monday  afternoon.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2006-7

Delegates met in the  morning to ask substantive questions about the proposed budget,  and informally in the afternoon to discuss draft SBI and COP/MOP 1  decisions from the Chair. Much of the discussion focused on how to  insulate the Secretariat's budget from the impacts of exchange  rate fluctuations, with the EU and others, opposed by the US,  supporting fixing the budget in Euros. The next meeting takes  place on Monday.

### RESEARCH NEEDS RELATING TO THE CONVENTION

Delegates met  informally to exchange views on a draft decision prepared by  Co-Chairs Castellari and Cigar√°n. Discussions focused on the  process, national and regional research needs, the need for  action-oriented decisions, the need for better communication  between research bodies and SBSTA, as well as feedback from the  scientific community, systematic observation, capacity building  and lists of needs. By Saturday evening some progress was  reported. Draft conclusions will be circulated on Monday.

### MATTERS RELATING TO THE LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

Delegates  stressed the need to finally conclude this item, and agreed that  the pre-session consultations and decision 6/CP.9 were the  starting points for deliberations. The UK, TUVALU and CANADA noted  that the COP gives direction to the GEF and not the reverse, and  that the GEF's responsibility is to operationalize this direction.

Delegates then discussed those elements that should be in the  draft COP/MOP 1 decision. The EU noted that the LDC Fund should,  inter alia, support integration with development plans, be  country-driven, and support implementation of urgent adaptation  measures. The LDC Group added that a portion of the LDC Fund  should support other elements of the LDC Work Programme. The GEF  agreed to provide delegates with a document defining  'additionality' to help clarify its applicability to the Fund.  NORWAY noted that the draft COP/MOP 1 decision should state that  guidance to GEF should be revisited annually. Based on this input,  the Chairs will develop text for distribution and consideration at  the group's Monday afternoon meeting.

### OZONE AND CLIMATE ISSUES - HFCS AND PFCS

Chair Goetze presented  draft conclusions. The US expressed reservations about inviting  submissions from Parties on this matter. CHINA, with SAUDI ARABIA  and JAMAICA, proposed removing a paragraph inviting the Montreal  Protocol to make a statement at a future session of SBSTA, while  the EU, NORWAY and SENEGAL supported retaining it. The US said it  would accept the paragraph if the call for submissions was  removed. Informal consultations will continue.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Co-Chairs Liptow and Agyemang-Bonsu  introduced their compilation of submissions for draft conclusions  and terms of reference for the EGTT, which was welcomed by parties  as a good basis for negotiations. JAPAN and CANADA noted the  absence of innovative financing and TT:CLEAR. Malaysia, for the  G-77/CHINA, noted the lack of reference to technologies listings.

Delegates then began negotiating on proposed text paragraph-by- paragraph. Discussions focused on technology needs assessments and  on publicly-owned technologies. Debate centered on what 'publicly- owned' and 'public-domain' technologies actually mean, and the  links to intellectual property rights. The G-77/CHINA said it is  interested in technologies that can be released to the public  domain, and CHINA stated that it would not accept any linkage  between public domain technologies and property rights. The  Co-Chairs will prepare a revised text and consult informally.

### ADJUSTMENTS FOR LULUCF

Co-Chair Rosland presented an amended  version of the annex to the draft COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 decision on  technical guidance for methodologies for adjustments for LULUCF  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/2), and delegates engaged in paragraph-by- paragraph discussions. Whether or not to include a reference to  the magnitude of adjustments as a report requirement of expert  review teams was left unresolved. Consultations will continue  informally.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Some delegates were studying comments made during the in-session  SBSTA adaptation workshop over issues of climate change versus  natural climate variability. One observer suggested the issue  could have more to do with liability than atmospheric science.

Meanwhile, at the end of a busy but unexceptional Saturday in the  contact groups, Secretariat staff and contact group chairs retired  to their offices burdened with preparing a large number of draft  decisions and conclusions by Monday.

There was some compensation for their 'lost weekend' in Bonn,  though, with the prospect Saturday evening of the traditional NGO  party. 'Some Parties may be saving their energy for COP/MOP 1,'  said one participant, 'but the most important Party here is the  NGO Party,' he added, referring to Saturday night's festivities.
