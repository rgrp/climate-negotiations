# SBSTA

## ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS:

SBSTA Chair Mama Konaté (Mali) opened the session. Parties adopted the agenda and agreed to the organization of work (FCCC/SBSTA/2010/1).

## OPENING STATEMENTS:

Yemen, for the G-77/CHINA, emphasized the importance of making progress on technology transfer and said he looked forward to the progress report on the NWP. Spain, for the EUROPEAN UNION (EU), highlighted possibilities for progress on: the NWP; using research and science to inform negotiations; REDD; technology transfer; and standardized baselines under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). Grenada, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), requested holding the first contact group meetings before tabling draft conclusions and supported joint SBSTA and SBI meetings on technology transfer. The Democratic Republic of the Congo, for the AFRICAN GROUP, called for an emphasis on adaptation planning and practices, and proposed a work programme on implementing adaptation activities and an ad hoc technical group on adaptation, with fixed terms of reference, a finite lifespan and fixed costs.

PANAMA, also speaking for Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Guatemala, Peru, Uruguay and the Dominican Republic, stressed the importance of making progress on REDD, including participation of all developing countries. On technology transfer and the NWP, he urged moving to the implementation of concrete activities. Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, called for consideration of how the SBSTA can advance decisions on information, as well as scientific and technological matters. Noting the ad hoc and temporary nature of the AWGs, she urged development of a work programme, starting at this meeting, to carry forward agreements reached by parties. On the NWP, BOLIVIA underscored the need for studies to determine adaptation costs and benefits, and consideration of study results in the context of the desired greenhouse gas (GHG) stabilization levels. He also urged that discussions on forests take into consideration the concerns and participation of indigenous peoples. Lesotho, for the least developed countries (LDCs), called for decisions on research and systematic observation for LDCs to focus on strengthening institutions through revived consideration of a LDC work programme. He highlighted the need for concrete action on the NWP, REDD and technology transfer.

## NWP:

The Secretariat introduced the item (FCCC/SBSTA/2010/INF.2; FCCC/SBSTA/2010/2-3 and 5). The INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC) noted that the Task Group on Data and Scenario Support for Impact and Climate Analysis (TGICA) would continue to support the work of the NWP and that the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) would, inter alia , address impacts and response strategies, adaptation needs and constraints in more detail.

JAPAN called for extending the NWP based on its cumulative achievement in improving understanding of adaptation. Kiribati, for AOSIS, stressed the need for information dissemination reflecting the low level of connectivity in small island developing states (SIDS) and streamlined and simplified funding mechanisms. She called for mechanisms to address loss and damage through insurance and noted the burden that monitoring, reporting and verfication (MRV) of adaptation programmes places on LDCs and SIDS.

NICARAGUA highlighted uncertainty in the costs of adaptation and questioned the ability of market mechanisms to help vulnerable countries.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

On the first day of the Bonn Climate Change Talks, many participants commented that they were happy to be back after what some described as a long pause in the substantive negotiations following Copenhagen. But are our expectations for the COP and COP/MOP actually lower than they were this time last year and how much will we able to achieve this year? I am not so sure, commented a veteran negotiator. However, long-term issues and the two AWGs remained in the background as the first day was dedicated to the opening plenaries of the SBI and SBSTA. Both Subsidiary Bodies have what delegates described as extremely busy agendas. The meeting rooms were also crowded; the smaller SBSTA plenary hall was filled to capacity and overflow rooms were designated for those that could not find seats in the main hall. The reason was what some referred to as yet another delay in completing the international conference center in Bonn. We said our tearful goodbye to the Maritim last August when we thought we d be moving into a new venue and now we re having a tearful reunion said one delegate, who had to remain standing for most of the morning plenary session. On the substantive side, many delegates emerging from the flexibility mechanisms discussions under the SBSTA commented on what they characterized as increasingly political statements and criticism against market mechanisms by some countries, as well as strong disagreements over CCS and forests in exhaustion under the CDM. But we will be discussing standardized baselines under the CDM, noted one developed country delegated, seemingly pleased. In the evening, delegates gathered to celebrate the tenure of Executive Secretary Yvo de Boer and bid him farewell at a reception hosted by the German government. There were laughs, good cheers, some walks down memory lane and even a few teary eyes during the speeches, handshakes and hugs. Expect Yvo de Boer s reflections on his tenure to come in the closing SBI plenary next Wednesday afternoon.
