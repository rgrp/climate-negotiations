# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS

This contact  group addressed two matters: the institutional linkage of the  Secretariat to the UN, and privileges and immunities for  individuals serving on bodies established under the Kyoto  Protocol.

###     Institutional Linkages

Parties agreed on a draft decision on  institutional linkages without further comment or amendment. The  text approves the continuation of the Secretariat's current  institutional linkage with the UN until such time as a review is  deemed necessary by either the COP or the UN General Assembly.

###     Privileges and Immunities

CDM Executive Board Chair Sushma Gera  highlighted concerns among members and experts of constituted  bodies under the Kyoto Protocol about the potential risks of legal  action, noting that individuals are not covered by the relevant UN  instruments, although the UNFCCC Headquarters Agreement with the  German Government could afford protection, at least in Germany.  However, she added that concerns about broader liability are  affecting the Board's deliberations.

Parties emphasized that members and experts serving on bodies  under the Protocol should be able to carry out their tasks free  from the threat of third party claims. Delegates also discussed  options for addressing this concern, as set out in a note by the  Secretariat (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/6). Several Parties, including the  EU and SOUTH AFRICA, said it would not be possible to achieve a  final resolution on this issue at COP/MOP 1, and the EU presented  an assessment of all the options. Parties also discussed whether  an 'interim measure' could provide some additional security until  a final arrangement was implemented. Discussions will resume on  Monday afternoon.

### ARTICLE 3.9 OF THE PROTOCOL (FUTURE COMMITMENTS)

Co-Chair Drake  presented a compilation of Conference Room Paper submissions by  the G-77/China, EU and Japan. Delegates agreed to consider this  compilation, and a closed informal contact group continued meeting  into Saturday evening.

### CAPACITY BUILDING UNDER THE PROTOCOL

Co-Chair Turesson presented  a new Co-Chairs' draft decision based on a submission by the G-77/China on capacity building relating to the implementation of  the Protocol in developing countries. Parties welcomed the new  text as a starting point for discussions, while expressing initial  reservations about wording related to support of the framework for  capacity building. Minor differences also emerged on text related  to support for the framework in countries with economies in  transition. A Co-Chairs' draft SBI conclusion on capacity building  under the UNFCCC was also presented. Co-Chair Turesson asked for  Parties' views on the texts by Monday at 11:00 am, in order to  further consideration of the issue in a contact group in the  afternoon.

### CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD REPORT

Two informal meetings were held on  Saturday. Co-Chairs Brackett and do Lago produced a revised draft  decision and delegates commented on the bracketed sections.  Developing countries insisted on explicit wording on the CDM's  continuity post-2012, but some developed countries noted that,  even if they may agree with the objective, this contact group was  not the right forum to decide this issue. While Parties appeared  to be in agreement on the need to extend the deadline for  retroactive crediting for early start CDM projects, they continued  to differ on the details, including eligibility criteria for  projects seeking to benefit from this extension. A new proposal  was submitted on the share of proceeds to cover administrative  expenses of the Executive Board, but some Parties supported the  Board's original proposal, and no agreement was reached on this  issue. Other contentious issues included administrative matters;  carbon dioxide capture and storage under the CDM; whether local,  national or regional policy standards and programmes can be  considered CDM project activities; and additionality. Informal  consultations will continue on Monday.

### COMPLIANCE

Informal consultations continued on the adoption of  the compliance mechanism and Saudi Arabia's proposal to amend the  Protocol to make the mechanism legally binding. A developed  country group submitted new text proposing to adopt the compliance  mechanism by a COP/MOP 1 decision, with the amendment mentioned in  the preamble. In addition, two developing countries submitted new  texts on the original proposal from the Africa Group containing  text for a decision and an amendment. Informal consultations will  continue, with the Chairs providing a draft decision on Sunday.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Adaptation Fund: Delegates met throughout  Saturday in closed informal consultations in an attempt to make  progress on the Adaptation Fund text. At the morning session, the  Co-Chairs introduced a draft decision that seeks to find common  ground between the EU and G-77/China proposals that were tabled  earlier. Delegates then began to review the Co-Chairs' draft, and  agreed to bring elements of each of the two previous proposals  into that text. The Co-Chairs will produce a revised draft  decision for consideration on Monday.

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION LOG

Delegates concluded their work on a  draft decision on the international transaction log relating to  registry systems under Article 7.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. The text  sets out a schedule for implementing the international transaction  log in 2006, with a view to allowing registry systems to connect  to it by April 2007. Parties added text requesting an interactive  exercise of this electronic system to demonstrate its  functionality once it is ready for implementation. A report from  the exercise will be presented to the COP/MOP.

### IPCC SPECIAL REPORT ON CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE AND STORAGE

Delegates met informally in the morning to consider the draft  text, agreeing on the workshop objective of increasing  understanding of carbon dioxide capture and storage and covering  the relevant provisions of the forthcoming 2006 IPCC Guidelines  for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. In the afternoon, the  contact group reconvened and delegates agreed on draft text which,  inter alia: notes the IPCC's assessment of carbon dioxide capture  and storage and encourages Parties and the private sector to  support related research, development, deployment and diffusion of  such technologies; sets out the workshop's objectives and  reporting; and requests the GEF to consider whether supporting  carbon dioxide capture and storage, particularly through capacity  building, is consistent with its objectives. The contact group  concluded its work early Saturday evening.

### JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (JI)

Delegates convened informally to  discuss a Chair's draft COP/MOP decision. Parties differed on how  to use experiences from the CDM under the second track of JI, in  particular whether CDM's designated operational entities (DOEs)  may act as accredited independent entities, and whether JI  projects can use CDM methodologies and the CDM project design  document. Developing countries insisted that DOEs and CDM  methodologies cannot be applied automatically, given the  differences between JI and CDM host countries, and between JI and  CDM procedures. However, several developed countries opposed this,  calling for a 'quick start JI' in accordance with the Marrakesh  Accords. These countries emphasized that in practice DOEs have  already been used in determining JI projects, and noted that some  CDM methodologies apply anywhere. No agreement was reached.  Informal consultations will continue on Monday.

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

Common Reporting Format (CRF) for LULUCF:  Co-Chair Rosland presented revised draft conclusions on the CRF,  noting some changes in the text, including new wording requesting  SBSTA 24 to consider inventory issues associated with biomass  burning and natural disturbances as they relate to reporting under  the UNFCCC. Delegates then proceeded paragraph-by-paragraph  through the Co-Chairs' draft conclusions and Annex containing  Notes on the CRF, and revised the CRF tables. After making minor  editorial changes, delegates agreed to the draft text and to the  draft tables as presented, concluding the contact group's work on  this issue.

Criteria for Cases of Failure to Submit Information Relating to  LULUCF Estimates: Co-Chair Paciornik presented draft SBSTA  conclusions and a draft COP/MOP decision on criteria for cases of  failure to submit information relating to estimates of emissions  and removals by sinks. After editorial and other minor changes,  Parties agreed to the draft texts.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Informal consultations that had been  ongoing throughout the week concluded with agreement on three  draft SBI conclusions. These texts relate to the work of the  consultative group of experts (CGE), the compilation and synthesis  of initial national communications, and provision of financial  support. Discussions on this item focused on language encouraging  the CGE to develop a comprehensive training strategy and other  technical support, with a group of developed countries proposing  wording that would focus this work, while some developing  countries preferred text that would leave the scope of this work  more broad. Delegates eventually agreed that the strategy should  be 'cost-effective and comprehensive.'

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

Delegates discussed  additional text encouraging Annex I Parties to facilitate  participation of developing countries in implementation  activities, and removed text on designation of national agents for  ocean observation. The contact group approved the rest of the  draft text as had previously been agreed informally, and concluded  its work early Saturday evening.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Delegates discussed the draft text on the  framework for implementation. Disagreements continued on  paragraphs requesting the Secretariat to prepare a compilation of  public technologies and a guide on technologies for adaptation.  Differences also remained on the outstanding paragraph dealing  with the EGTT's 2006 Work Programme, which relates to a side event  on public technologies. Delegates also considered a draft decision  presented by the G-77/China. Discussions continued informally late  into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

While the corridors were a little less crowded on Saturday,  dedicated negotiators gave no indications that the weekend was a  time to relax. Intense discussions continued in numerous contact  groups and consultations. 'This is the unglamorous but critical  part of the meeting where we try to sort out the technical matters  before the politicians arrive next week,' explained one  participant. Some meetings were more productive than others.  Delegates emerging from a few groups were in celebratory mood:  participants dealing with the 'little known but nevertheless  important' international transaction log finished their work, as  did those engaged on LULUCF methodological issues. However, CDM,  finance and other issues remained unresolved as of Saturday  evening. Discussions on Article 3.9 (future commitments) and the  financial mechanism seemed to create the most frustrations.  Article 3.9, in particular, continued to be the subject of  considerable discussion in the corridors as news continued to  spread that the COP/COP-MOP President had consulted heads of  delegation on a proposal on future work linked to the Convention,  not the Kyoto Protocol. There were also rumblings in the corridors  that at least one key delegate in a major negotiating group is  'polarizing' positions both within and outside the group.

Some participants were focused more on what was happening outside  the conference center, as thousands descended on central Montreal  to demand action on climate change. 'Let's just hope the  politicians arriving next week find out about this,' said one  NGO participant.
