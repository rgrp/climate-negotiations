abstract: "The eleventh Conference of the Parties (COP 11) to the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the first  Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to  the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1) took place in Montreal, Canada,  from 28 November to 10 December 2005. The event drew 9500  participants, including 2800 government officials, over 5800  representatives of UN bodies and agencies, intergovernmental  organizations and non-governmental organizations, and 817  accredited members of the media."
---

At COP/MOP 1, parties discussed and adopted decisions on the  outstanding operational details of the Kyoto Protocol, including a  package of decisions known as the 'Marrakesh Accords.' These  decisions contain guidelines for how the Protocol will function,  such as those relating to the 'flexible mechanisms' intended to  help parties reach their emissions targets in a cost-effective  way, and a compliance mechanism. COP/MOP 1 also took decisions on  a process for considering further commitments for post-2012, when  the Protocol's first commitment period ends. Various  methodological, administrative, financial and institutional  matters were also considered.

COP 11 addressed issues such as capacity building, technology  development and transfer, the adverse effects of climate change on  developing and least developed countries, and several financial  and budget-related issues, including guidelines to the Global  Environment Facility (GEF), which serves as the Convention's  financial mechanism. After lengthy negotiations, the COP also  agreed on a process for considering future action beyond 2012  under the UNFCCC.

The COP and COP/MOP were assisted in their work by the Subsidiary  Body for Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for  Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), which met from 29  November to 6 December. There were also over a twenty contact  groups formed to help advance discussions, and a large number of  informal consultations.

A joint COP and COP/MOP high-level segment was held from 7-9  December. Over 120 ministers and other high-level government  officials made statements, along with senior representatives of  observer organizations, UN bodies, specialized agencies and other  stakeholders. Over 140 'side events' were held on a range of  climate change topics, (reports can be found at  http://www.iisd.ca/climate/cop11/enbots/). There were also several  major 'parallel events' organized with assistance from the host  government, as well as numerous other climate and energy-related  exhibits, displays, launches and initiatives.

In his closing comments early in the morning on 10 December, COP  President Stéphane Dion declared the meetings a success, expressing  satisfaction that they had avoided so many potential pitfalls and  achieved a consensus outcome. With the Kyoto Protocol now  operational and a post-2012 path now envisaged, most participants  agreed that COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 was an important milestone in  moving the process forward.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered to be one of the most serious threats  to sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on the  environment, human health, food security, economic activity,  natural resources and physical infrastructure. Global climate  varies naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations  of anthropogenically-produced greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate. According to the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the effects of  climate change have already been observed, and scientific findings  indicate that precautionary and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change began with  the adoption of the UNFCCC in 1992. The UNFCCC sets out a  framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid 'dangerous  anthropogenic interference' with the climate system. Controlled  gases include methane, nitrous oxide and, in particular, carbon  dioxide. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994, and now  has 189 parties. The parties to the UNFCCC typically convene  annually in a Conference of the Parties (COP), and twice a year in  meetings of the subsidiary bodies - the Subsidiary Body for  Implementation (SBI) and the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and  Technological Advice (SBSTA).

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In December 1997, delegates at COP 3 in Kyoto,  Japan, agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  to achieve emissions reduction targets. These countries, known  under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their  overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by an average of 5.2%  below 1990 levels between 2008-2012 (the first commitment period),  with specific targets varying from country to country. The  Protocol also establishes three flexible mechanisms to assist  Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost- effectively: an emissions trading system; joint implementation  (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties; and  the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows for emissions  reduction projects to be implemented in non-Annex I Parties  (developing countries). Following COP 3, parties began negotiating  many of the rules and operational details governing how countries  will reduce emissions and measure their emissions reductions. To  date, 157 parties have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, including 37  Annex I Parties representing 61.6% of 1990 Annex I greenhouse gas  emissions. The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February  2005.

### BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

The process for finalizing the rules  and operational details of the Protocol was agreed at COP 4 in  1998 in a document known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action. The  Plan set COP 6 as the deadline for finalizing these rules and  operational details and strengthening implementation of the  UNFCCC. In November 2000, parties met at COP 6 in The Hague, the  Netherlands, to complete these negotiations. They were not  successful and delegates suspended COP 6 until July 2001, when it  reconvened in Bonn, Germany. After further talks, delegates agreed  to adopt a political decision, the Bonn Agreements. While this  decision provided high-level political direction on the  implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, delegates were still unable  to finalize text on some issues, and agreed to forward all the  draft decisions to COP 7 for final resolution.

### MARRAKESH ACCORDS

In late October and early November 2001 at  COP 7, delegates resumed their discussions and reached agreement  on the Marrakesh Accords. These Accords consist of a package of  draft decisions on many of the details of the flexible mechanisms,  reporting and methodologies, land use, land-use change and  forestry (LULUCF) and compliance with the Kyoto Protocol that  should be adopted by the first COP/MOP. The Accords also address  support for developing countries, including capacity building,  technology transfer, responding to the adverse effects of climate  change, and the establishment of three funds - the Least Developed  Countries (LDC) Fund, Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF), and  Adaptation Fund.

Delegates built on the Marrakesh Accords at COP 8 and COP 9,  agreeing on rules and procedures for the CDM Executive Board, and  on modalities and procedures for afforestation and reforestation  project activities under the CDM. Parties also discussed how to  integrate findings of the IPCC's Third Assessment Report into the  work of the UNFCCC, and agreed on two new agenda items focused on  adaptation and mitigation.

### COP 10

At COP 10 in Buenos Aires in December 2004, delegates  agreed to the Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and  Response Measures. Parties also took decisions on technology  transfer, LULUCF, the UNFCCC's financial mechanism, and education,  training and public awareness. However, some issues remained  unresolved, including items on the LDC Fund, the SCCF, and  Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of policies and measures).  Meanwhile, lengthy negotiations were held on the complex and  sensitive issue of how parties might engage on commitments to  combat climate change in the post-2012 period. The Kyoto Protocol  requires parties to begin considering the post-2012 period by  2005. Delegates agreed to hold a Seminar of Governmental Experts  prior to SB 22 in May 2005, although the terms of reference for  the Seminar did not refer specifically to the post-2012 period or  new commitments.

### SEMINAR OF GOVERNMENTAL EXPERTS AND SB 22

This seminar took place  in May 2005, in Bonn. Delegates started to address some of the  broader issues facing the climate change process, including a  future framework and commitments beyond 2012. Immediately  following the seminar, the 22nd meeting of the Subsidiary Bodies  (SB 22) convened, focusing on preparations for COP 11 and  COP/MOP 1, and addressing a variety of issues ranging from budget  matters to adaptation and mitigation.

# REPORT OF COP 11 AND COP/MOP 1

The eleventh Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework  Convention on Climate Change and first Conference of the Parties  serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol opened  on Monday, 28 November 2005. Parties also met for the twenty-third  sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies, a high-level ministerial  segment, and numerous contact groups and informal consultations.

These meetings resulted in the adoption of 14 decisions by the COP  and over 30 by the COP/MOP, and in the approval of a number of  conclusions by the Subsidiary Bodies. This report summarizes the  discussions, decisions and conclusions based on the agendas of the  COP, COP/MOP and the Subsidiary Bodies.

# UNFCCC COP 11 REPORT

COP 11 opened on Monday morning, 28 November, with a welcoming  ceremony that involved presentations from Gerald Tremblay, Mayor  of Montreal, and Jean Charest, Premier of Québec. Mayor Tremblay  highlighted the seriousness of climate change and the support of  local governments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Premier  Charest noted the province of Québec's support for emissions  reductions and the need for strong action to address climate  change. The speeches were followed by a live performance  highlighting the impacts of climate change.

COP 10 President Ginés González García (Argentina) then officially  opened COP 11. He asked delegates to observe one minute of silence  in memory of UNFCCC Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter, who  passed away on 14 October 2005. Praising her 'tireless dedication  and enthusiasm,' he said the best tribute delegates could give  would be to produce a strong outcome at this meeting.

Parties then elected by acclamation Stéphane Dion, Canada's  Environment Minister, as President of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1. Dion  called for steps to 'implement, improve and innovate,' including  formally adopting the Marrakesh Accords and improving  implementation of the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, including the  Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). He also noted the need to begin  consideration of commitments beyond 2012.

UNFCCC Acting Executive Secretary Richard Kinley highlighted 2005  as a remarkable year for international climate policy, and drew  attention to new data showing an increase in Annex I emissions and  the need for further action.

Several countries made opening statements and highlighted  technology transfer and the five-year programme of work on  adaptation. Jamaica, on behalf of the Group of 77 and China  (G-77/China), expressed concern about the Resource Allocation  Framework (RAF) of the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The  United Kingdom, on behalf of the European Union (EU), called for  an 'open mind' and 'creative and innovative ways' to address  climate change after 2012. Kenya, for the Africa Group, noted an  inadequate commitment on capacity building, while Bangladesh, on  behalf of the LDCs, highlighted the need to operationalize the  LDC, Adaptation and Special Climate Change Funds.

# ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

### ADOPTION OF THE RULES OF PROCEDURE

The COP then considered the  draft rules of procedure and, noting lack of progress on draft  rule 42 (voting), agreed to apply the draft rules of procedure,  with the exception of draft rule 42. Further consultations during  COP 11 did not result in agreement on rule 42.

### ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA

Parties then adopted the provisional  agenda (FCCC/CP/2005/1), with the exception of the item on the  second review of the adequacy of UNFCCC Article 4.2 (a) and (b)  (policies and measures on emissions and removals from sinks). This  particular item has been held in abeyance at every COP since COP 4  due to a lack of agreement on a proposal by the G-77/China to  amend the item to 'Review of the adequacy of implementation' of  Article 4.2 (a) and (b). Following further consultations on the  matter, President Dion reported back to the COP on 9 December that  no agreement had been reached and that the issue would be held in  abeyance and included on COP 12's agenda.

Regarding COP 11's organization of work, the US emphasized the  need for a clear separation between Convention and Protocol- related issues. The COP agreed on the organization of work as  proposed by the President and approved the list of organizations  to be admitted as observers (FCCC/CP/2005/2).

### ELECTION OF THE COP BUREAU

On Friday, 9 December, the COP elected  officers other than the President. The COP Vice Presidents are:  Heorhiy Veremiychyk (Ukraine), Atilio Savino (Argentina), Bruno T.  Sekoli (Lesotho), Ibrahim Ahmed Ali Al-Ajmi (Oman), Fariba  Darvishi (Iran), Jacek Mizak (Poland), and Enele Sopoaga (Tuvalu).  William Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) was elected as COP Rapporteur,  Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) was elected Chair of  SBSTA, and Thomas Becker (Denmark) was re-elected SBI Chair. The  COP also approved the calendar of meetings of convention bodies  for 2006-2010 (FCCC/SBI/2005/10) and the report on credentials  (FCCC/CP/2005/4).

### OFFER TO HOST COP 12 AND COP/MOP 2

During the closing session of  COP 11, Kenya announced its offer to host COP 12 and COP/MOP 2.  The Secretariat will report back to parties by February 2006.

# REVIEW OF IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMITMENTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS OF  THE CONVENTION

The agenda item on review of implementation of commitments and  other provisions of the Convention involved consideration of  several sub-items dealing with the financial mechanism, national  communications from both Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, the  development and transfer of technologies, capacity building under  the Convention, and implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9  (adverse effects), which included consideration of the five-year  programme of work on adaptation and matters relating to least  developed countries (LDCs). This section summarizes the  discussions and outcomes on each of these sub-items.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM (CONVENTION)

These items were first taken up  in SBI plenary on 29 November, at which time they were forwarded  to a contact group co-chaired by Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and  Karsten Sach (Germany). The contact group met several times  between 29 November and 6 December on these items and financial  items under the Kyoto Protocol.

###     Special Climate Change Fund

The contact group discussed this  issue from 30 November to 2 December, negotiating from the text  forwarded by SBI 22 (FCCC/2005/SBI/10). The Co-Chairs introduced a  new draft decision but progress was slow and delegates did not  agree on wording, regarding the Fund's priority areas, and the  timing, regarding the COP's review of SCCF implementation in such  areas. On 2 December, Parties agreed to forward revised text from  the contact group Co-Chairs, as well as proposals from the EU and  G-77/China, to SBI Chair Becker. SBI Chair Becker introduced a  revised text to the SBI plenary on 6 December, but the G-77/China  proposed, and Parties agreed, to forward instead the text from  SBI 22 to SBI 24.

###     SBI Conclusions

The SBI draft conclusions carried over from SBI  22 (FCCC/SBI/2005/10) include reference to the activities,  programmes, and measures relating to climate change in the areas  set out in paragraph 2(c) of Decision 7/CP.7 (funding under the  Convention - Special Climate Change Fund) that are complementary  to those funded by resources allocated to the climate change focal  area of the GEF. Bracketed text remains in the priority areas  identified, as well as in the subsequent section outlining funding  areas that are complementary to paragraph 2(d) Decision 7/CP.7.

Matters Relating to the Implementation of Decision 5/CP.8 (Review  of the Financial Mechanism): After introduction of this issue in  SBI on 29 November, delegates discussed this issue informally and  in a contact group meeting on 2 December, at which time parties  approved draft SBI conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.28), SBI  notes with appreciation the report from the Secretariat on the  experience of international funds and multilateral financial  institutions relevant to the investment needs of developing  countries in meeting their commitments under the Convention  (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.7). SBI agrees to use the report at SB 24 as  input to the consideration by SBI of the third review of the  financial mechanism, and to report on the outcome of that  consideration at COP 12.

Additional Guidance to an Operating Entity of the Financial  Mechanism: Following SBI plenary consideration on 29 November,  parties discussed this item informally and adopted a draft COP  decision on 6 December. On 9 December, the COP adopted the  decision.

###     COP Decision

In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.29), the COP  requests the GEF to include in its report to the COP information  on the initial application of the RAF to resources allocated in  the fourth replenishment and how the RAF is likely to affect  funding available to developing countries for the implementation  of their commitments under the Convention. It also requests the  GEF to consider whether supporting carbon capture and storage  technologies, in particular capacity-building activities, would be  consistent with its strategies and objectives and, if so, how they  could be incorporated within its operational programmes.

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS: Annex I Parties:

SBI considered Annex I  national communications in plenary on 28 November, focusing on  proposals for streamlining the review processes for 2006-2007  (FCCC/SBI/2005/16); and taking note of the report on national  greenhouse gas inventory data from parties included in Annex I to  the Convention for the period 1990-2003 (FCCC/SBI/2005/17), and  of the status report on the review of third national  communications (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.9). A contact group co-chaired  by Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya) and Dimitrios Lalas (Greece), met  from 29 November to 2 December and drafted two decisions on  streamlining review of national communications under the  Convention and under the Kyoto Protocol. On 6 December, SBI  adopted these two decisions, which were subsequently confirmed by  COP and COP/MOP on 9 December.

###     COP Decision

In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.23), the COP agrees  to streamline review procedures for Annex I national  communications under the Convention for the period 2006-2007.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.24), the  COP/MOP agrees to review procedures for reporting required under  the Protocol from Annex I Parties in 2006-2007.

###     Non-Annex I Parties

On 28 November, the SBI plenary considered  non-Annex I national communications, focusing on compiled  information on this issue (FCCC/SBI/2005/18 and Adds. 1-6), and  projects proposed by non-Annex I Parties for financing, as  permitted under UNFCCC Article 12.4 (FCCC/SBI/2005/Inf.8).  Following informal consultations, SBI adopted conclusions and a  draft decision on submission of second or third national  communications on 6 December. These texts relate to the work of  the Consultative Group of Experts (CGE), the compilation and  synthesis of initial national communications, and provision of  financial support. Discussions on this item focused on whether a  broad or focused scope should be given to the CGE for the  development of a comprehensive training strategy and other  technical support. Delegates agreed that the strategy should be  'cost-effective and comprehensive.' On 9 December, the COP and  COP/MOP confirmed these decisions and conclusions.

###     COP Decision

The COP adopted a decision on submission of second,  or third national communications (FCCC/SBI/2005/10/Add.1)  deciding, inter alia, that non-Annex I Parties should apply for  financing for their second or third national communications,  whether or not they have completed their first national  communications, and seek to submit them within four years of the  disbursement of funds.

They also adopted conclusions on the Consultative Group of Experts  on National Communications from non-Annex I Parties  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.27), compilation and synthesis of initial  national communications (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.26), and financial and  technical support (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.25/Rev.1).

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Technology transfer was first addressed by  the SBSTA in plenary on 29 November. The issue was divided into  two sub-agenda items, on matters relating to the implementation of  the framework for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the  implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention, and on the 2006  Work Programme of the Expert Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT).  EGTT Chair Kishan Kumarsingh (Trinidad and Tobago) presented the  EGTT's 2005 annual report and a proposal for the EGTT's 2006 work  programme (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.10), with a focus on, inter alia,  reporting of technology needs, public technologies, innovative  financing and technologies for adaptation. Commenting on the  proposal, Malaysia, for the G-77/China, said a COP decision should  provide guidance on the review of the EGTT; stressed that new  approaches to technology transfer should be consistent with the  objectives of the UNFCCC; recommended a high-level round table on  technology cooperation and partnerships; and urged additional  resources for the EGTT. Japan and the US emphasized the role of  public-private partnerships, and many parties highlighted other  technology-related initiatives. China stressed the need to  overcome tax, intellectual property and other barriers.

Contact and informal groups, co-chaired by Holger Liptow (Germany)  and Carlos Fuller (Belize), met from 30 November through 5  December. On the EGTT's 2006 Work Programme, discussions focused,  inter alia, on publicly-owned technologies and those in the public  domain (public technologies), a side event on public technologies,  and holding a high-level round table and a special working  session. On implementation of the framework, discussions included  public and adaptation technologies, and the preparation of a  technical paper by the Secretariat. The discussions resulted in  agreement on conclusions and a draft decisions, which were adopted  by SBSTA on 6 December. The COP was adopted the decision on 9  December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions on the EGTT's 2006 Work  Programme (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.23), SBSTA, inter alia: endorses the  proposed 2006 EGTT Work Programme; requests that the Secretariat  organize a special working session of the EGTT; requests the EGTT  to arrange a side event on transfer of public technologies; and  further requests the EGTT to report to SBSTA 25.

In the conclusions on implementation of the framework for  meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation of  Article 4.5 of the Convention (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.24), SBSTA, inter  alia: takes note of a pilot project on networking between TT:CLEAR  and regional technology information centers; looks forward to the  Secretariat's technical papers on innovative financing and  adaptation technologies; and acknowledges that there are  technology initiatives underway in other forums.

###     COP Decision

In the decision on implementation of the framework  for meaningful and effective actions to enhance the implementation  of Article 4.5 of the Convention (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.24/Add. 1),  the COP invites parties to submit their view on the continuation  of the EGTT. It also requests the Secretariat to organize a  senior-level roundtable discussion on lessons learned, technology  deployment, transfer, cooperation and partnerships, and requests  SBSTA to take into account existing technology-based international  initiatives and partnerships undertaken between parties when  considering future work for enhancing the implementation of the  framework.

### CAPACITY BUILDING UNDER THE CONVENTION

This issue was initially  addressed by SBI in plenary on 28 November, before being taken  up in a contact group co-chaired by Joyceline Goco (Philippines)  and Anders Turesson (Sweden), which met once and also held  informal consultations. The COP took note of the SBI conclusions  on 9 December.

Discussions initially focused on the need to establish a contact  group and the extent to which the group should consider the GEF  review on capacity building. The G-77/China called for a contact  group to develop more guidance to the GEF, while the EU said the  GEF review should be discussed under the agenda item on the report  of the GEF.

###     SBI Conclusions

In these conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.36), SBI  reiterates the importance of capacity building for developing  countries. It requests the Secretariat to report to each COP on  capacity-building activities under Decision 2/CP.7, disseminate  information on best practices and lessons learned, and report on  the GEF's progress on developing capacity-building indicators. It  indicates that GEF's activities should be guided by Decisions  2/CP.7 and 2/CP.10 and welcomes the GEF's country programmes for  LDCs and small island developing states (SIDS).

### ARTICLE 4.8 AND 4.9 (ADVERSE EFFECTS)

Implementation of the  Buenos Aires Programme of Work on Adaptation and Response  Measures: The scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of  impacts of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change,  was first taken up in plenary on 28 November. It was then  discussed in three contact groups on 29-30 November and 2  December, as well as in informal consultations that extended late  into the night and early morning. On 2 December, SBSTA adopted  conclusions and a bracketed draft COP decision, but consultations  continued during the following days in an attempt to remove the  brackets. These were finally removed late on 8 December, in time  to forward a non-bracketed decision to the COP.

There was general agreement among parties on the importance of  this five-year programme of work. However, discussions revealed  that agreeing on specific activities of the programme would take  more time, as parties had just started consideration of the issue  after COP 10. The G-77/China called for an action-oriented  programme of work. They also proposed to proceed under a two-track  approach that would include priority actions that could be  undertaken immediately, while allowing for other more time- consuming actions to be given consideration. The US emphasized  stocktaking and assessments, sharing of experiences, and a  sectoral approach. Tuvalu, the Cook Islands and others preferred a  'learning-by-doing' approach, and called for the inclusion of  reference to SIDS. Saudi Arabia emphasized adaptation to response  measures, and Canada, the EU and many others stressed the need to  engage experts and practitioners and encourage long-term  cooperation. The G-77/China also called for bottom-up approaches  and, opposed by the US, Canada, the EU and others, for the  establishment of an expert group to address the issue.

Parties worked their way through the different sections of the  programme of work, addressing the objective, expected outcome,  scope of work, and modalities of the programme of work, as well as  an indicative list of activities. On 6 December, they agreed to  SBSTA conclusions and a draft COP decision. However, brackets  remained in several places, including on reference to economic  diversification, SIDS and LDCs. There were also brackets around  reference to the Arctic among the particularly vulnerable areas.  By 8 December, many of the outstanding issues had been resolved,  with the exception of reference to LDCs and SIDS in the objective  of the programme, and references to economic diversification of  vulnerable economic sectors, as supported by Saudi Arabia and  others. But these issues were also resolved and a final decision,  including an annex containing the five-year programme of work, was  adopted by the COP on 9 December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.30),  SBSTA takes note of an indicative draft list of activities for the  programme of work (contained in an annex), and agrees to further  elaborate the list at SBSTA 24. Furthermore, SBSTA requests the  Secretariat to compile an initial list of organizations and  institutions active in areas relevant to the programme of work,  and invites parties and organizations to provide input to this  list by 13 February 2006, and requests the Secretariat to organize  an informal meeting of party representatives before SBSTA 24, in  order to identify the activities starting in 2006.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2005/L.3), the COP notes  that adaptation to climate change and its adverse effects is of  high priority for all countries, and that developing countries,  especially LDCs and SIDS, are particularly vulnerable. It further  notes the increasing body and evolving nature of scientific  knowledge, including on the Arctic and other areas, and of  practical experiences responding to adaptation needs. Moreover,  the COP: reaffirms that the response to climate change should be  coordinated with social and economic development in an integrated  manner; recognizes and encourages, inter alia, the importance of  local and indigenous knowledge; and notes that the programme of  work on adaptation is of broad concern to all parties. The  decision adopts a five-year programme of work, contained in an  annex, requesting SBSTA to:start implementation of the programme of work by undertaking  the initial activities specified in the SBSTA conclusions; consider and elaborate further additional activities and  modalities of the programme of work, including the possible role  of a group or group of experts; consider at its twenty-eighth session further activities and  modalities, taking into consideration the results of the initial  activities and the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report; and review the programme of work at COP 16.

The Five-Year Programme of Work on Adaptation includes the  objective, expected outcome, scope of work, and modalities. The  stated objective is to assist all parties, in particular  developing countries, including the LDCs and SIDS, to improve  their understanding and assessment of impacts, vulnerability and  adaptation, and to make informed decisions on practical adaptation  actions and measures. Expected outcomes of the programme of work  include: enhancing capacity at all levels to identify and  understand impacts, vulnerability and adaptation responses, and  implementing practical, effective and high priority adaptation  actions. The programme also aims to provide for enhanced  cooperation, development and dissemination of knowledge from  practical adaptation activities, as well as further integration of  adaptation actions with sustainable development activities.

The scope of work comprises two thematic areas: impacts and  vulnerability, and adaptation planning, measures and actions. Each  of these thematic areas includes several action-oriented sub- themes, such as promoting development and dissemination of  assessment methodologies and tools, collecting and disseminating  information on current and historical climate change and its  impacts, and on practical adaptation actions. The scope also  includes the promotion of measures, methodologies and tools  including for economic diversification aimed at increasing  economic resilience and reducing reliance on vulnerable economic  sectors, especially for relevant categories of countries listed in  UNFCCC Article 4.8. Methodologies, data and modeling, and  integration into sustainable development are cross-cutting issues  to be incorporated in the specific activities. Among the  modalities identified are workshops and meetings, drawing on  inputs from experts, practitioners and relevant organizations,  compendia and web-based resources, submissions, reports and  technical papers, as well as other modalities, such as groups  of experts.

###     Least Developed Countries

On 29 November, Paul Desanker (Malawi)  briefed SBI on the work of the LDC Expert Group and progress with  the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs). A contact  group, co-chaired by Dechen Tsering (Bhutan) and Aloisia Wörgetter  (Austria), was established. The group discussed a new mandate and  terms of reference for the LDC Expert Group (LEG), focusing on  clarifying how the LEG will assist LDCs in implementing NAPAs, and  the length of the LEG's new mandate, as well as on a paragraph  requesting the LEG to develop a work programme for consideration  by SBI. On 6 December, SBI recommended a draft COP decision  extending the mandate for the LDC Expert Group, and COP 11 adopted  the decision on 9 December.

###     COP Decision

In this decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.17), the COP  decides to extend the mandate for the LDC Expert Group until 2007,  with the task of developing a work programme that includes  implementation of NAPAs for consideration at SBI 24.

# EMISSIONS FROM DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

This agenda item was first presented in the COP plenary on 30  November. It was subsequently taken up twice in a contact group  chaired by Hernán Carlino (Argentina) on 1 December and 5  December, and in an informal group on 6 December. The issue was  taken up in response to a request by Papua New Guinea and Costa  Rica, supported by other countries, to include an agenda item on  'Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries:  approaches to stimulate action.' The proposal received wide  support, as parties stressed the importance and the complexity of  this issue and agreed to initiate a process to address it.  Differences in opinion arose over whether the consideration should  be referred to SBSTA to first address scientific and technical  aspects, as proposed by the EU and others, or whether it should be  referred to both SBSTA and SBI to address both technical and  policy aspects, as preferred by the G-77/China, the Alliance of  Small Island States (AOSIS) and others. The US opposed the  consideration of this issue under SBI. Brazil, the EU and others  stressed that this was an issue to be considered under the UNFCCC.  All agreed that calling for submissions, including from accredited  observers as proposed by the EU, should be the first step forward.  The differences were resolved by forwarding the issue to SBSTA,  but inviting parties to include information on policy approaches  and positive incentives, and to submit recommendations on any  further process to consider the issue. The decision also includes  reference to positive incentives, as proposed by Brazil, Papua New  Guinea and others.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/CP/2005/L.2), the COP invites  parties and accredited observers to submit, by 31 March 2006,  their views on issues relating to reducing emissions from  deforestation in developing countries, focusing on relevant  scientific, technical and methodological issues, and the exchange  of relevant information and experiences, including policy  approaches and positive incentives and recommendations on any  further process to consider these issues. The COP further requests  SBSTA to organize a workshop before SBSTA 25.

# ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS

COP 11 took up various administrative, financial and institutional  matters, including budget issues, the institutional linkage of the  Secretariat to the UN, and the procedure for appointing an  Executive Secretary for the UNFCCC.

### BUDGET ISSUES

These items were first taken up in SBI plenary on  30 November. On income and budget performance in the biennium  2004-05 (FCCC/SBI/2005/13 and FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.10), parties  decided that the Secretariat, in consultation with interested  parties, would draft conclusions. On the programme budget for the  biennium 2006-07, the SBI decided to take note of revisions to the  Secretariat's work programme (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.6). On 6 December,  the SBI adopted conclusions and a draft decision. The COP adopted  this decision on 9 December.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.21 Add.1), the COP  takes note of the interim financial statements, and the income and  budget performance in the biennium 2004-2005; urges all parties  that have not yet paid their contributions to do so without delay;  and calls for more and continued contributions to the trust funds  in order to ensure wider participation in the process and delivery  of important outputs and results.

### INSTITUTIONAL LINKAGE OF THE SECRETARIAT TO THE UN

SBI first  addressed this issue on 29 November (FCCC/SBI/2005/15). A contact  group, chaired by Masao Nakayama (Micronesia), discussed this item  on 1 and 3 December, developing a draft COP decision, which was  adopted by the COP on 9 December.

###     COP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.19), the COP  approves the continuation of the current linkage and related  administrative arrangements between the Secretariat and the UN;  and invites the Secretary-General to seek endorsement by the  General Assembly.

### PROCEDURE FOR APPOINTING AN EXECUTIVE SECRETARY

This issue was  first taken up by the COP on 30 November, when President Dion  outlined the procedure for selecting a new UNFCCC Executive  Secretary, as set out in recent correspondence with the UN  Secretary-General's office. He noted that the procedure is the  same as for all senior UN appointments, and that the COP Bureau  looks forward to being consulted by the Secretary-General on the  appointment. The COP took note of these arrangements.

# METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES UNDER THE UNFCCC

The COP took up various methodological issues, including harvested  wood products, the Common Reporting Format for LULUCF, and  emissions from fuel used for international aviation and maritime  transport.

### HARVESTED WOOD PRODUCTS

This issue was taken up in SBSTA plenary  on 28 November, and subsequently in informal consultations  co-chaired by Nagmeldin Goutbi Elhassan (Sudan) and Peter Brisbane  (Australia). Its consideration of the matter followed a request  from SBSTA 21 for Annex I Parties to submit information on changes  in carbon stocks and greenhouse gas emissions from harvested wood  products, and on experiences with the use of the revised IPCC  Guidelines and the Good Practice Guidelines for LULUCF. These  submissions were compiled by the Secretariat, together with other  information related to harvested wood products. However, since  this is a complex issue that applies only to the second commitment  period, and given the tight agenda at this meeting, parties soon  agreed to take up this issue again at SBSTA 24.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.16),  SBSTA takes note of the submissions; notes with appreciation the  IPCC report on progress made with respect to estimating and  reporting harvested wood products in the context of the  preparation of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse  Gas Inventories; and decides to continue consideration of this  issue at SBSTA 24.

### LULUCF COMMON REPORTING FORMAT (CRF)

This issue was first  addressed in SBSTA on 28 November, and in two contact groups  co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton Paciornik (Brazil).  An informal drafting group, facilitated by María José Sanz (Spain)  was set up to address technical issues in the CRF tables. By 3  December, parties had agreed to the revisions on the CRF tables  and to include in the decision a request for SBSTA to further  consider inventory issues associated with biomass burning and  natural disturbances as they relate to reporting under the  Convention, as proposed by Tuvalu, and with reporting of carbon  stock changes, as suggested by the US.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.19),  SBSTA agrees to consider at its twenty-fourth session, inter alia:  how emissions and removals now covered in the LULUCF and  agriculture sectors will be presented in the national totals;  inventory issues associated with biomass burning and natural  disturbances as they relate to reporting under the Convention; and  the implications on reporting of the conversion to CO2 in the  atmosphere of methane, carbon monoxide and non-methane volatile  organic compounds emitted in association with carbon stock changes.

###     COP Decision

In this decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.19/Add.1), the  COP adopts the CRF tables contained in its annex, decides that  each Annex I Party shall use these tables in their submissions  of the annual inventory due in and after 2007, and requests the  Secretariat to incorporate them into the Guidelines for the  preparation of Annex I national communications in time for  SBSTA 25.

### EMISSIONS FROM FUEL USED FOR INTERNATIONAL AVIATION AND MARITIME  TRANSPORT

On 28 November, Jane Hupe, International Civil Aviation  Organization (ICAO), briefed SBSTA on ICAO's work on aviation  emissions since SBSTA 22. SBSTA Chair Benrageb noted that  consideration of this agenda item had not been completed at  SBSTA 22, and asked José Romero (Switzerland) to hold informal  consultations. These took place throughout the week and focused on  whether to hold a workshop on this issue. However, on 6 December,  Romero reported the lack of consensus to SBSTA and noted that  bracketed text remained (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/CRP.1). The EU, South  Africa, Japan, Australia, Chile, AOSIS and others supported  holding a workshop, while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Libya opposed  this. Lacking consensus, SBSTA instead adopted brief conclusions  forwarding the matter to SBSTA 24.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.28),  SBSTA agrees to forward the issue to SBSTA 24 for its  consideration.

# REPORTS OF THE SUBSIDIARY BODIES

On 9 December, the COP adopted the reports of the twenty-third  sessions of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological  Advice (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/4 & Add.1 & Amend.1; FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.15)  and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.16).  The reports include numerous items that were subsequently taken up  by the COP and/or COP/MOP. There were also several items on which  conclusions were adopted by the subsidiary bodies, with no follow  up required by the COP or COP/MOP. This section provides details  on UNFCCC issues taken up in the reports of the subsidiary bodies  and addressed only by the SBI or SBSTA but that were not directly  dealt with in the COP.

### SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Issues addressed by SBI 23  related to the UNFCCC included education, training and public  awareness, and a review of the Secretariat.

###     Education, Training and Public Awareness

Parties were briefed on  UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public awareness) during  an SBI plenary meeting on 29 November, which focused on: the new  UNFCCC Climate Change Information Network (CC:iNet), an internet  information clearing house; regional workshops (FCCC/SBI/2005/21  and FCCC/SBI/2005/14); and UNEP's work on Article 6. A contact  group chaired by Crispin d'Auvergne (Saint Lucia) developed draft  conclusions on the issue. The group met several times to finalize  text, with no serious disagreements emerging. The final  conclusions were adopted by SBI on 6 December.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions on UNFCCC Article 6  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.18), SBI, inter alia, notes that the financial  resources available are not sufficient to meet the needs and  concerns identified by parties, and urges Annex I and Annex II  parties, the GEF and other bilateral and multilateral agencies to  continue to support financially the implementation of Article 6  activities. SBI also welcomes the launch of the prototype  information network clearing house (CC:iNet); notes that five  countries have established Article 6 focal points, and encourages  others to do so. It requests parties to submit views on the  clearing house, and asks the Secretariat to organize a workshop on  Article 6 and the particular needs of SIDS before SBI 25.

###     Internal Review of the Activities of the Secretariat

This issue  was first discussed by SBI on 29 November, at which time parties  tasked the Secretariat with preparing conclusions, in consultation  with interested parties. On 6 December, the SBI adopted these  conclusions.

###     SBI Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2005/10 Add. 1), SBI  takes note of information relating to the functions and operations  of the Secretariat as contained in several documents, particularly  in document FCCC/SBI/2005/13, and agrees to consider this item  again at SBI 25.

### SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

Issues  addressed by SBSTA 23 that relate to the UNFCCC included  mitigation of climate change, research and systematic observation,  and cooperation with relevant international organizations.

###     Mitigation

The scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects  of mitigation of climate change were first addressed by SBSTA on  28 November, when parties considered reports on the matter  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/INF.5, Misc.12 and Adds. 1-2).

Many parties stressed the usefulness of the intersessional  workshops, while China and South Africa expressed concern about  the recent increase in greenhouse gas emissions by developed  countries. Australia, Canada, Switzerland and others highlighted  a sectoral approach to mitigation and a focus on 'key areas,'  including transport, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and  carbon capture and storage. Australia underlined mitigation  co-benefits. The EU underscored the need to study implications  of different carbon dioxide stabilization levels and emissions  pathways.

Contact and informal groups, co-chaired by Kok Seng Yap (Malaysia)  and Toshiyuki Sakamoto (Japan), met from 29 November to 6  December. Discussions focused on whether to hold in-session or  intersessional workshops, historic and per capita emissions,  lessons learned, and a request to the Secretariat for a technical  paper. After lengthy discussions on lessons learned, no agreement  was reached and five sub-paragraphs describing lessons learned  were removed from the text, as well as reference to historic and  per capita emissions, and requests for the technical paper.

SBSTA adopted conclusions on Tuesday night, 6 December, and the EU  expressed disappointment that it had not been possible to agree to  a more ambitious programme.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In its conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.29)  SBSTA, inter alia:agrees to focus on exchanging information and sharing  experiences; requests the Secretariat to organize pre- and in-session  workshops on agriculture, forestry and rural development, urban  planning and development, energy efficiency, power generation, and  non-CO2 emissions; and states that each workshop should address currently available  and emerging technologies, international cooperative efforts on  technology, socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, and cross cutting  aspects.

###     Research and Systematic Observation

This item was first addressed  by SBSTA on 29 November, when delegates heard reports on the:Global Climate Observing System (GCOS)  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/Misc.14); Global Terrestrial Observing System (GTOS)  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/Misc.16); Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS)  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/Misc.17/Rev.1); views of parties on an ocean climate observing system  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/Misc.15 & Add.1); and collaboration between CEOS, GCOS and the Global Earth  Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).

Many delegates welcomed these reports and stressed collaboration  between GCOS and GEOSS. Uganda highlighted the need to address  data gaps, particularly in Africa, and China and Panama emphasized  regional capacity. Contact and informal groups, co-chaired by  Stefan Rösner (Germany) and Philip Gwage (Uganda), met from 1-3  December. Discussions focused on issues such as the UN Food and  Agriculture Organization's (FAO) standards for terrestrial  observations, reporting guidelines for national communications,  oceanic observations, the need for data exchange and international  data exchange centers, a regional workshop programme, capacity  building, particularly in Africa, and cooperation between GCOS and  the Group on Earth Observations (GEO). SBSTA adopted conclusions  on 6 December.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.17),  SBSTA, inter alia:urges parties to further implement the GTOS implementation  plan, particularly capacity building; urges parties to designate GCOS national coordinators and  focal points; calls on the GTOS Secretariat to assess the status of  development of standards for terrestrial observations; agrees to revise reporting guidelines on global observing  systems; notes the importance of oceanic observations; reiterates the importance of data exchange; and invites support of international data centers.

###     Cooperation with Relevant International Organizations

SBSTA  considered the issue of cooperation with relevant international  organizations along with related items on the special report of  the IPCC on carbon dioxide capture and storage, the Mauritius  International meeting to review the implementation of the  Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of SIDS, and  cooperation with other conventions, scientific organizations and  United Nations bodies.

These issues were first taken up in the SBSTA plenary on 28  November. Regarding the agenda item on SIDS, the US opposed  inclusion of the item on the SBSTA agenda as it had already been  considered at SB 22. However, many other parties, including AOSIS,  the G-77/China and EU supported its inclusion. After informal  consultations, it was decided that the item will be held in  abeyance, and will be included in the next session's provisional  agenda. The US also expressed procedural concerns on having a  separate agenda item for the IPCC's special report. After informal  consultations, the issue was included under the agenda item on  cooperation with relevant international organizations.

Regarding cooperation with relevant organizations, SBSTA  Coordinator Halldor Thorgeirsson reported to SBSTA on 29 November,  regarding the Joint Liaison Group and its consideration of a paper  on enhanced cooperation among the Rio Conventions (Climate Change,  Biodiversity and Desertification). He also outlined relevant  activities of the Commission on Sustainable Development, including  its focus on energy, atmosphere and climate change in 2006-2007.  Delegates were then briefed on cooperation and linkages by  representatives of relevant international organizations, including  the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, IPCC, FAO, UN International  Strategy for Disaster Reduction and the UN Forum on Forests. SBSTA  Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya) said he would prepare  conclusions on the issue.

The IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage was  taken up in SBSTA on 29 November, when Bert Metz, Co-Chair of IPCC  Working Group III (mitigation), outlined the IPCC's Special  Report, including additional energy requirements, costs, risks,  leakage, and legal and regulatory issues. Many delegates stressed  the relevance of carbon dioxide capture and storage as a  mitigation tool. Contact and informal groups, co-chaired by  William Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) and Thomas Verheye (European  Commission), met from 1-3 December to consider these issues.

The EU, supported by Saudi Arabia and others, proposed holding an  intersessional workshop to enable further discussion on carbon  dioxide capture and storage. The US said such a workshop should  focus on experiences. Norway, the EU and the G-77/China noted that  consideration of ocean storage is premature. AOSIS expressed  concern regarding the risks involved in carbon dioxide capture and  storage, and Libya said more research was needed. Australia, with  the G-77/China, stressed the need for demonstration projects in  both developed and developing countries. Iran asked for inclusion  of such projects in the CDM, while China said 'the door should be  left open' for this.

Discussions focused on issues such as the workshop format and  objectives, reference to technology maturity, and carbon capture  and storage relation to the CDM and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for  National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.

On 6 December, all outstanding issues were resolved and SBSTA  adopted conclusions that included text from SBSTA Chair Benrageb  on cooperation with other conventions and from the contact group  on the IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage.

###     SBSTA Conclusions

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.26),  SBSTA, inter alia: recognizes the valuable input from other  organizations; notes that carbon dioxide capture and storage  systems are in various stages of development; requests the  Secretariat to organize an in-session workshop at SB 24 on carbon  dioxide capture and storage; and encourages parties and the  private sector to support related research, development,  deployment and diffusion of such technologies.

# OTHER MATTERS

### FUTURE ACTION UNDER THE UNFCCC

The issue of future action and  commitments beyond 2012 was first addressed by the COP/MOP on  Wednesday, 30 November, under its agenda item on the consideration  of Protocol Article 3.9 (Annex I Parties' future commitments).  However, the issue also became relevant to the COP because  President Dion initiated a parallel but related process on future  action under the UNFCCC, in addition to the COP/MOP discussions  relating to the Protocol. Negotiations on approaches under the  UNFCCC and Protocol were interlinked, and decisions on these  issues were finally agreed after lengthy negotiations early on  Saturday, 10 December. A summary of these discussions and  decisions is presented together under the COP/MOP section on  'Article 3.9 and Future Action'.

# KYOTO PROTOCOL COP/MOP 1 REPORT

COP/MOP 1 President Stéphane Dion opened COP/MOP 1 on Monday, 28  November. Several parties made opening presentations regarding  items on the COP/MOP's agenda. The UK, on behalf of the EU, said  she looked forward to the adoption of the Marrakesh Accords,  supported adoption of a decision on the compliance regime, and  identified the need for more work on the CDM and guidance on the  Adaptation Fund. She also stressed that the EU is ready to start  discussions under Article 3.9 (future commitments). Tuvalu, on  behalf of AOSIS, called for future commitments under Article 3.9,  and said efforts to streamline the CDM should not compromise its  environmental integrity. Jamaica, on behalf of the G-77/China,  expressed concern at the GEF Resource Allocation Framework.  Bangladesh, for the LDCs, highlighted the need to operationalize  the LDC, Adaptation, and Special Climate Change Funds.

# ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

The COP/MOP considered its provisional agenda for the meeting on  28 November. While the agenda was generally agreeable, the EU  objected to the inclusion of the item on Protocol Article 2.3  (response measures) in the agenda on the grounds that it was being  addressed elsewhere. Saudi Arabia objected to its removal. The  agenda was adopted as presented, with this item held in abeyance  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/1/Add.1).

### ARTICLE 2.3 (RESPONSE MEASURES)

Article 2.3 was discussed again  in SBSTA on 29 November, as it was also on the SBSTA agenda. Saudi  Arabia, supported by some parties, opposed by the EU and several  parties, requested a SBSTA contact group on the issue. SBSTA Chair  Benrageb convened informal consultations. On 7 December, Saudi  Arabia once again requested a contact group on the issue. Noting  no agreement, Chair Benrageb presented draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.22) agreeing to continue consideration of the  issue in the next session.

# ADOPTION OF DECISIONS FORWARDED BY THE COP (MARRAKESH ACCORDS)

On 30 November, COP/MOP President Dion introduced a package of  decisions forwarded by the COP to the COP/MOP under the terms of  the Marrakesh Accords agreed at COP 7 in 2001. The aim of the  Accords was to establish many of the operational details of the  Kyoto Protocol. The COP/MOP adopted the package without further  amendment. The package included decisions on land use, land-use  change and forestry (LULUCF) and matters relating to Article 3.14  (adverse effects), Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information) and 8 (review of information), the  flexible mechanisms, and accounting of assigned amounts under  Article 7.4 (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3 and Adds.1-4). These decisions had  been agreed at COP 7, with some further amendments since. However,  they required formal adoption by the COP/MOP to enter into effect.

Describing the adoption of these as a 'landmark achievement'  resulting from seven years' hard work, President Dion thanked  delegates for approving a 'clear rule book' for the Protocol.  Canada said these decisions will 'breathe life' into the Protocol  and provide the basis for implementation. He suggested that the  next step should be improvement, particularly in the operation of  the CDM and through technology transfer. This section contains a  brief description of the decisions by issue area.

# LULUCF AND ADVERSE EFFECTS

### COP/MOP Decision on LULUCF - Principles, Rules, and Guidelines

This decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.1) includes principles that  govern the treatment of LULUCF activities, an annex establishing  rules and guidelines for the first commitment period, and an  appendix. Principles include the exclusion of carbon stocks from  accounting, clarifying that accounting for LULUCF activities does  not imply a transfer of commitments to a future commitment period,  and that the reversal of any removal due to LULUCF activities must  be accounted for at the appropriate time. The guidelines in the  annex include, for example, that Annex I Parties may account in  the first commitment period afforestation, reforestation and  deforestation activities from 1990 to 2012, up to a maximum amount  determined in the appendix, times five; and credits arising from  CDM projects on afforestation and reforestation amounting to up to  'one per cent of base year emissions times five.' COP/MOP Decision on Good Practice on LULUCF: This decision  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.1) adopts the IPCC guidelines for  providing information on anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions by  sources and removal by sinks from LULUCF activities.

###     COP/MOP Decision

on Matters Relating to Article 3.14 (Minimizing  Adverse Effects of Mitigation on Developing Countries): The  decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.1) requests Annex I Parties to  provide information as part of their annual inventory report on  the minimization of adverse social, environmental and economic  impacts on developing country parties, and requests the  Secretariat to organize before COP/MOP 2 a workshop on reporting  methodologies on ways to minimize adverse effects of mitigation  activities on developing countries.

# GUIDELINES ON NATIONAL SYSTEMS AND INVENTORIES

### COP/MOP Decision on Guidelines on National Systems

In its  decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.2), the COP/MOP adopts guidelines  included in its annex on national systems for the estimation of  anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all  greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol. The  annex includes definitions, objectives, characteristics and  general functions of national systems. Functions include the  preparation of national annual inventories in a timely manner and  providing information necessary to meet reporting requirements  under COP or COP/MOP decisions.

###     COP/MOP Decision

on Guidelines on the Preparation of Information  under Article 7 (Information on Compliance with Commitments): In  its decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.2), the COP/MOP adopts  guidelines included in its annex on the provision of information  by Kyoto Protocol parties on compliance with their emission  reduction targets and other commitments under the Protocol.  Guidelines include, inter alia, reporting the acquisition of  Assigned Amount Units (AAUs), Certified Emissions Reductions  (CERs), Emissions Reduction Units (ERUs), and Removal Units (RMUs)  from national registries in a standard electronic format.

###     COP/MOP Decision

on Standard Electronic Format for Reporting Kyoto  Protocol Units: In this decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.2), the  COP/MOP adopts the standard electronic format and an annex with  general reporting instructions and model reporting tables.

###     COP/MOP Decision

s on Guidelines under Article 8 (Review of  Information by Expert Teams): Four decisions were adopted on this  issue, all contained in document FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.2:Conduction of Reviews: In this decision, the COP/MOP  establishes the dates to commence periodic and annual reviews for  Annex I Parties and includes an annex with guidelines for the  conduction of reviews on national inventories, information on  compliance with commitments, national systems, national  registries, and information on minimizing adverse impacts on  developing countries.

Terms of Service for Lead Reviewers: In this decision, the  COP/MOP establishes that reviewers will be based in their home  countries.

Training Programme: In this decision, the COP/MOP requests  the Secretariat to develop a training programme for members of  expert review teams including an annex on premises and courses for  the training programme and an annex on criteria for the selection  of lead reviewers.

Confidential Information: This decision determines the  possibility for expert review teams to recommend, on an  exceptional basis, the retroactive application of an adjustment  based on the access to relevant confidential information.

# FLEXIBLE MECHANISM AND MODALITIES FOR ACCOUNTING OF ASSIGNED  AMOUNTS UNDER ARTICLE 7.4

### COP/MOP Decision on Principles, Nature and Scope of the  Mechanisms

This decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.3) emphasizes  environmental integrity and provides that mechanisms can only be  used to supplement domestic action. It indicates that eligibility  of Annex I Parties to use mechanisms depends on compliance with  methodological and reporting obligations.

###     COP/MOP Decision on Guidelines for Article 6 (Joint  Implementation)

This decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.3) defines  the JI Supervisory Committee (JISC) and criteria for participating  in JI. Host countries fulfilling all criteria may verify emissions  reductions by themselves (first track); others must use procedures  involving 'accredited independent entities' and the JISC (second  track).

###     COP/MOP Decision on Modalities, Rules and Guidelines for Emissions Trading

This decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.3) determines the  eligibility criteria for trading AAUs. They require Annex I  Parties to maintain a 'commitment period reserve' that cannot be  below 90% of their respective assigned amounts, or '100% of five  times their most recently reviewed inventories.' COP/MOP Decision on Modalities for Accounting Assigned Amounts  under Article 7.4.: This decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.3)  includes requirements for calculating and recording assigned  amounts. The modalities contain provisions on compliance  assessment, including making additions and subtractions, and  carrying over registry units to subsequent commitment periods. At  the end of the commitment period, each Annex B party must retire  AAUs, ERUs, CERs, and/or RMUs equivalent at least to its  greenhouse gas emissions and sources during that period. It may  carry-over any AAUs not retired, as well as ERUs and CERs not  retired, to a maximum of 2.5% for each, of the party's assigned  amount. RMUs cannot be carried over. The modalities also outline  requirements for national registries and procedures for issuing  and transferring AAUs, ERUs, and RMUs. The modalities also contain  provisions on the international transaction log, publicly  accessible information, and compilation and accounting of  emissions inventories and assigned amounts at the end of the  additional period for fulfilling commitments, including a database  maintained by the Secretariat.

###     COP/MOP Decision on modalities and procedures for CDM

This  decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/3/Add.4) describes the roles of COP/MOP  and the CDM Executive Board in administrating the CDM. It defines  differentiated participation requirements for Annex I and  non-Annex I Parties. The text contains provisions on accrediting  designated operational entities (DOEs), and monitoring,  validation, verification and certification of emissions reductions  generated by CDM projects as well as issuance of CERs.

# REPORT OF THE CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD

Sushma Gera, Chair of the CDM Executive Board, presented the  Board's 2004-2005 Report (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/4 & Add.1) at the  COP/MOP plenary on 30 November. A contact group, co-chaired by  David Brackett (Canada) and André do Lago (Brazil), was  established to give further guidance on the CDM. The contact group  held three meetings and several informal consultations.

A COP/MOP decision was adopted on 9 December. Several Annex I  countries and the European Community pledged a total of  US$8,188,050 for funding the CDM, with the largest donations  coming from Canada (US$1.5 million), Germany (US$1 million), Japan  (US$1 million), Italy (US$1 million), the UK (US$740,000) and  Spain (US$500,000).

The discussions covered various issues including governance,  methodologies, additionality, regional distribution, capacity  building and resources for work on the CDM. Several parties,  including the EU, highlighted the need to expedite the Board's  work in order to cope with the large number of projects expected  in the coming years. Thailand called for transparency in the  Board's decision-making, including written reasoning. China and  others noted the need to streamline procedures.

Several developing countries, including Chile and Peru, raised  concerns over the Board's proposal to levy US$0.20 per CER to  cover its administrative expenses and called for differentiation.  Russia proposed increasing the levy to US$0.50 to accommodate the  financial concerns that the G-77/China raised in the JI contact  group. Brazil responded by mentioning a levy on proceeds from JI  projects and emissions trading to the Adaptation Fund. Mexico,  India, Panama and others noted the need to consider additionality,  while Brazil highlighted that environmental integrity must be  ensured when improving the CDM.

The G-77/China called for a signal on the CDM's continuity beyond  2012, but Japan and EU argued that this issue must be resolved in  the Article 3.9 contact group. The Africa Group lamented the  uneven geographical distribution of projects and called for  capacity building in Africa.

The COP/MOP also elected five new members and five alternates to  the CDM Executive Board, including one from Eastern Europe, one  from Annex I, one from AOSIS, and two from non-Annex I  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.1 & Add.1).

###     COP/MOP Decision

In this decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.7), the  COP/MOP recognizes the need to ensure the CDM's continuity beyond  2012. It extends the deadline for retroactive crediting for  'prompt start' CDM projects.

The decision addresses CDM administration, requesting the Board to  identify measures aimed at strengthening the CDM and its  responsiveness to the needs of Parties and stakeholders. It  indicates that the Board must give adequate explanations for its  decisions.

On the share of proceeds to cover the Board's administrative  expenses, the decision adopts a progressive approach, with the  first 15,000 CERs per project being subject to a lower levy of  US$0.10 and the subsequent to US$0.20.

The COP/MOP requests the Board to call for public input on new  ways of demonstrating additionality and improving the  'additionality tool.' It highlights the need for further progress  regarding baseline and monitoring methodologies, decides that  projects under 'a programme of activities' can be registered as a  single project, and states that large-scale projects can be  bundled. The Board is also requested to develop a simplified  methodology for small-scale projects switching from non-renewable  to renewable biomass.

Parties are invited to make submissions on carbon dioxide capture  and storage under the CDM. The Secretariat is requested to  organize a workshop in conjunction with SBSTA 24, and the Board is  requested to consider proposals for carbon dioxide capture and  storage project methodologies. COP/MOP 2 will give further  guidance on carbon dioxide capture and storage.

On capacity building and regional distribution, the COP/MOP  invites party submissions by 31 May 2006 on 'systemic or  systematic' barriers to equitable distribution of CDM projects.  It requests parties to provide capacity building and the Board  to meet with designated national authorities on a regular basis.

# JOINT IMPLEMENTATION

The agenda item on implementation of Article 6 of the Kyoto  Protocol (joint implementation) was addressed by the COP/MOP  plenary on 30 November, in two contact group meetings and several  informal consultations chaired by Daniela Stoycheva (Bulgaria).  The COP/MOP decision was adopted on 9 December.

Discussions revealed the desire of Annex I countries to quickly  operationalize second-track JI, taking advantage of CDM  experiences, while the G-77/China emphasized differences between  JI and CDM. Highlighting the spirit of the Marrakesh Accords, the  EU, Russia and others proposed that JI projects should be able to  use CDM's designated operational entities, project design document  and methodologies. The G-77/China insisted that these are not  applicable given the differences between the two mechanisms and  that the JISC should develop its own accreditation procedures for  independent entities and adopt distinct baseline and monitoring  methodologies.

The COP/MOP elected 10 members and 10 alternates for the Joint  Implementation Supervisory Committee, including three from  countries with economies in transition (EITs), three from other  Annex I Parties, three from non-Annex I Parties and one from SIDS  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.1 and Add.1).

###     COP/MOP Decision

In this decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.6), the  COP/MOP establishes the JI Supervisory Committee and outlines its  work programme. It requests JI Supervisory Committee to develop,  as a priority, standards and procedures for accrediting  independent entities, accredit such entities, and develop a  management plan and guidelines for small-scale JI projects.

The COP/MOP decides that the CDM's designated operational entities  may be provisionally and conditionally used in determining JI  projects, and that the CDM Executive Board's small-scale  methodologies and the CDM project design document may be applied  to JI projects, as appropriate.

# INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION LOG

The international transaction log, a system that performs  automated checks to verify transactions of different carbon  credits under the Kyoto Protocol, was first addressed by SBSTA on  29 November. Delegates were briefed on this issue  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/5) and Murray Ward (New Zealand) was asked to  chair a contact group. The contact group met three times and  informal consultations were also convened. While no serious  disagreements arose, there were questions about the timeline for  implementing the international transaction log. China and some  others wanted to ensure that the international transaction log,  which is supposed to allow national registry systems to connect to  it by April 2007, functions properly and meets the specifications  set for it. Text was added to this effect. On 6 December, SBSTA  agreed to a draft decision, which was subsequently adopted by the  COP/MOP 1 on 9 December.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In this decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.20/Add.1) on  guidance relating to registry systems, the COP/MOP notes that the  international transaction log is essential to the implementation  of the Kyoto Protocol's flexible mechanisms. It also notes that  registry systems may begin initialization testing with the log on  31 October 2006. The COP/MOP also adopts design requirements for  the technical standards for data exchange between registry systems  under the Kyoto Protocol. It requests the administrator to  implement the log in 2006, and requests a first meeting of experts  from non-Annex I Parties in March 2006. Further, it requests the  administrator to facilitate an interactive exercise that includes  experts from non-Annex I Parties to demonstrate the functioning of  the international transaction log with regard to other registry  systems.

# COMPLIANCE

### ADOPTION OF A COMPLIANCE MECHANISM AND SAUDI ARABIA'S PROPOSAL TO  AMEND THE PROTOCOL

These issues were first addressed by the  COP/MOP on 30 November and subsequently in a contact group  co-chaired by Harald Dovland (Norway) and Mamadou Honadia (Burkina  Faso). The contact group held three meetings and numerous informal  consultations. A draft COP/MOP decision was adopted on 9 December.

Discussions focused on the legal form of adopting the compliance  mechanism annexed to Decision 24/CP.7 adopted in Marrakesh as,  according to Protocol Article 18, a compliance system entailing  legally binding consequences must be adopted as an amendment to  the Protocol.

Highlighting the need for a legally binding system, Saudi Arabia  had proposed an amendment to the Protocol (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/2).  Japan and New Zealand opposed an amendment, emphasizing their  preference for a facilitative approach to compliance. Noting that  an amendment requires ratification, Canada cautioned that the  outcome was unpredictable, possibly creating two categories of  parties. The EU emphasized the need to operationalize the  compliance system and proposed its adoption by a COP/MOP 1  decision, after which an amendment could be considered. AOSIS, the  Africa Group, China and others also supported the adoption of the  compliance mechanism by a COP/MOP 1 decision combined with the  consideration of an amendment process.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In the final decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.5),  the COP/MOP 'approves and adopts' the compliance mechanism without  prejudice to the outcome of the amendment process. It requests SBI  24 to commence consideration of an amendment to the Protocol and  report to COP/MOP 3, which will make a decision on the issue. The  procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance adopted and  annexed to the COP/MOP decision are the same as in the annex to  Decision 24/CP.7.

The annex establishes a 20-member compliance committee with a  plenary, bureau, and facilitative and enforcement branches. The  plenary's main functions are administrative and budgetary. The  decision outlines the compliance committee's procedures, including  an appeal to the COP/MOP for due process reasons. It defines an  'additional period for fulfilling commitments' after the end of  the first commitment period.

The facilitative branch is responsible for promoting compliance,  providing implementation advice and facilitation taking into  account the principle of common but differentiated  responsibilities. Consequences applied by the facilitative branch  include advice and facilitation of financial and technical  assistance.

The enforcement branch receives questions of implementation from  expert review teams, and from parties regarding themselves or  other parties. It determines whether a party is complying with its  quantitative emissions reduction commitments, methodological and  reporting requirements, and the eligibility criteria for the  flexible mechanisms.

The enforcement branch may make a declaration of non-compliance  and request a party to develop a plan analyzing the causes and  indicating measures and timetable for remedying non-compliance. It  may also suspend mechanism eligibility if a party does not fulfill  the eligibility criteria or has exceeded its assigned amount. If a  party's emissions exceed its assigned amount, its assigned amount  for the second commitment period will be deducted by 1.3 times the  amount of excess tonnes.

### ELECTION OF THE COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE

This issue was addressed by  COP/MOP plenary on 30 November, when parties were requested to  make nominations for the compliance committee, and on 9 December,  when the members were elected.

###     COP/MOP Decision

The COP/MOP elected 10 members and 10 alternates  for each of the compliance committee's two branches. These include  one from each of the five UN regional groups, one from SIDS, two  from other Annex I Parties and two from other non-Annex I Parties  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.1 and Add.1).

# CAPACITY BUILDING UNDER THE PROTOCOL

This issue was introduced during an SBI plenary by Janos Pasztor,  UNFCCC Secretariat, on 29 November (FCCC/SBI/2005/Misc.3 & Add.1).  A contact group, co-chaired by Joyceline Goco (Philippines) and  Anders Turesson (Sweden), met three times and held informal  consultations. On 6 December, the SBI adopted two draft decisions,  which were subsequently adopted by the COP/MOP plenary on 9  December.

In the discussions, Japan said the focus should be on the  capacity-building framework. The G-77/China stressed capacity  building for the CDM. Japan said this should be considered in the  CDM contact group. South Africa underscored that capacity building  is a cross-cutting issue.

###     COP/MOP Decisions

In the decision on capacity building in  developing countries (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.35), the COP/MOP decides  that the capacity-building framework in Decision 2/CP.7 applies to  the Protocol's implementation. The decision indicates that  capacity building should be provided to enhance developing  countries' ability to participate in the CDM and lists priority  areas. It calls for urgent attention to the capacity-building  framework from Annex II Parties and requests the Secretariat to  report to the COP/MOP on efforts made to implement the framework.

In the decision on capacity building in EITs (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.37),  the COP/MOP indicates that the framework for capacity building in  Decision 3/CP.7 applies to the Protocol's implementation. It calls  for urgent attention to EITs' capacity-building needs and requests  the Secretariat to report to the COP/MOP.

# ARTICLE 3.9 AND FUTURE ACTION

The issue of future action and commitments was first addressed in  the COP/MOP plenary on 30 November, under the agenda item on  Protocol Article 3.9 (consideration of Annex I commitments for  subsequent periods). According to Article 3.9, the process must be  initiated in 2005. In their plenary statements, parties stressed  the importance of this issue. Canada, Switzerland and others  called for broad participation, while Zimbabwe and others  emphasized that Article 3.9 refers specifically to Annex I  countries. China suggested an ad hoc working group, and Tuvalu  suggested a world summit on climate change. Greenpeace, speaking  for environmental NGOs, called for a 'strong response.'

### INITIAL PROPOSALS

David Drake (Canada) and Alf Wills (South  Africa) co-chaired a contact group and informal consultations,  which met from 1 December through Friday night, 9 December.  Initially, three proposals were submitted by the G-77/China, the  EU, and Japan. Reaffirming that no new commitments shall be  introduced under the Protocol for non-Annex I Parties, the  G-77/China proposal called for an open-ended ad hoc group to  consider further commitments from Annex I countries with a view to  adopting a result at COP/MOP 4. The EU proposed recalled, inter  alia, Protocol Article 9 (review of the Protocol), decided to  initiate consideration of Annex I commitments in accordance with  Article 3.9, and invited parties to make submissions for further  consideration at SB 24. Also recalling Article 9, Japan's proposal  recognized that the Protocol is only a first step. Noting that  emissions in non-Annex I countries are growing rapidly, it  proposed initiating further consideration of Annex I commitments  and preparing a review under Article 9, and recommended that COP  12 starts a review of the UNFCCC to construct an effective  framework in which all parties participate to take action.

On 2 December, at a high-level informal meeting, President Dion  circulated a non-paper on a process on long-term cooperative  action under the Convention. The initial proposal resolved to  engage in discussion for long-term cooperative action to address  climate change, including environmental effectiveness, adaptation,  advancing development goals sustainably, market based approaches  and technology. Those discussions would take place in workshops  and be completed by COP 13. On 6 December the paper was formally  circulated (FCCC/CP/2005/CRP.1).

While the contact group on Article 3.9 focused only on Annex I  commitments, by Wednesday its deliberations had resulted in a  parallel informal group discussing a broader review of the  Protocol under Article 9.

### THREE PARALLEL CONSULTATIONS

Informal discussions on future  action and commitments, which went very late into the night from  7-9 December, were held in three separate groups, one on Protocol  Article 3.9 (future commitments), one on Protocol Article 9  (review of the Protocol), and one on President Dion's proposal  for action under the Convention. Each group's discussions were  dependent on progress made in the other groups, and it was  clear that if there was to be an outcome, that it would be a  'package deal.' On Thursday night, 8 December, the contact group on Article 3.9  reached agreement on a decision, conditional to progress in the  discussions under the UNFCCC framework and Protocol Article 9.  Later that night, all three issues were addressed as a 'package'  in a high-level informal group. The US walked out of discussions  early in the night, expressing concerns about the nature and  direction of the process. However, the group deliberated into the  early hours of the morning, and parties agreed, without the US, to  a draft decision on a dialogue on long term action.

On Friday morning, 9 December, the US offered a counter-proposal  to Dion's text and informal discussions continued all day. The US  proposal was presented as a 'take it or leave it' offer, based on  Dion's text, which strengthened references to technology and  stated that the process should be 'non-binding' and 'not open any  negotiations leading to new commitments.' After lengthy  discussions, a draft COP/MOP decision on Article 3.9, and a  revised draft COP decision on dialogue on long-term cooperative  action to address climate change by enhancing implementation of  the Convention, were circulated at 2:47 am on Saturday, 10  December. The Russian Federation raised concerns that the draft  decision on Article 3.9 lacked provisions for voluntary  commitments. The G-77/China, the EU, Japan, Mexico, AOSIS and many  others said that Article 3.9 was not the proper place to address  voluntary commitments. The EU, Norway, Bangladesh, France and  others expressed gratitude to the Russian Federation for ratifying  the Protocol, and urged the Russian Federation to accept the draft  decision on Article 3.9. China, Canada and several others  suggested adopting the draft decision and addressing the Russian  Federation's concerns in a different format or at a later date.

Informal discussions resumed at 4:28 am, and at 5:53 am a package  agreement was reached. The COP/MOP agreed to include in the  session report wording on the Russian Federation's concerns and to  invite parties to submit views on Article 9. At 5:57 am, the  COP/MOP adopted a decision on Article 3.9 and at 6:03 am the COP  adopted a decision on dialogue on long-term cooperative action to  address climate change by enhancing the implementation of the  Convention.

While there was no separate text issued on Protocol Article 9,  parties agreed to President Dion's proposal to include in the  report of the meeting an invitation for parties to submit relevant  information and views on how best to proceed under Article 9, by  September 2006.

###     COP Decision

In this decision on dialogue on long-term  cooperative action to address climate change by enhancing  implementation of the Convention (FCCC/CP/2005/L.4/Rev.1) the COP  reaffirms that development and poverty eradication are the first  and overriding priorities of developing country parties, and  recognizes that there is a diversity of approaches to address  climate change and the essential role of technology in addressing  climate change. The COP, inter alia:resolves to engage in a dialogue to exchange experiences and  analyze strategic approaches for long-term cooperative action to  address climate change including advancing development goals  sustainably, adaptation, technology and market-based  opportunities; further resolves that the dialogue will be non-binding and  will not open any negotiations leading to new commitments; agrees that the dialogue will be informed by the IPCC; agrees that the dialogue should identify actions to promote  sustainable development, mitigate and adapt to climate change, and  explore ways to promote access by developing countries to climate- friendly technologies; and decides that the dialogue will take place in workshops and  will report to COP 12 and COP 13.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In this decision on consideration of commitments  for subsequent periods for parties included in Annex I to the  Convention under Article 3.9 of the Kyoto Protocol:  (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.8/Rev.1), the COP/MOP, inter alia:decides to initiate without delay a process in an open-ended  ad hoc group to consider further commitments by Annex I Parties  beyond 2012; agrees that the group should aim to complete its work and  have it adopted by the COP/MOP in time to ensure that there is no  gap between commitment periods; and further agrees that the group will meet at SBSTA 24.

# ADMINISTRATIVE, FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL MATTERS

### BUDGET ISSUES

These items were first taken up by SBI on 30  November. On income and budget performance in the biennium 2004-05  (FCCC/SBI/2005/13 and FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.10), parties decided that  the Secretariat, in consultation with interested parties, would  draft conclusions. On the programme budget for the biennium  2006-07, the SBI decided to take note of revisions to the  Secretariat's work programme (FCCC/SBI/2005/INF.6). On 6 December,  the SBI adopted a draft decision. The COP/MOP adopted this decision  on 9 December.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In this decision, (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.22/Add.1),  the COP/MOP: takes notes of the income and budget performance in  the biennium 2004-2005; expresses concern about late payment to  the Kyoto Protocol Interim Allocation; encourages all Parties that  have not yet paid their contributions to do so without further  delay; and calls for more and continued contributions to the Trust  Fund, in particular to ensure continuation of work relating to the  implementation of the Kyoto Protocol.

### PRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS SERVING ON CONSTITUTED  BODIES ESTABLISHED UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

This item was first  taken up by SBI on 29 November, before being discussed in the same  contact group as the institutional linkage of the Secretariat to  the UN. Work on this item at the final contact group meeting  concluded on 9 December. Parties emphasized that members and  experts serving on bodies under the Protocol should be able to  carry out their tasks free from the threat of third party claims.  Delegates also discussed options for addressing this concern, as  set out in the note by the Secretariat (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/6).  Several parties said achieving a final decision on this item at  COP/MOP 1 would not be possible. The EU presented an assessment of  all of the listed options. Parties agreed that this matter would  be taken up again at SBI 24, and drafted a decision that was  adopted by the COP/MOP on 9 December.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.31), the  COP/MOP, inter alia, requests the SBI to consider this matter at  SBI 24; invites parties to submit to the secretariat, by 13  February 2006, their views on this item for compilation; and  requests the Executive Secretary to consult the UN Secretary- General and to report to SBI 24.

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM (KYOTO PROTOCOL)

The series of sub-items  under this agenda item were first taken up in the SBI plenary on  30 November and were forwarded to a contact group co-chaired by  Rawleston Moore (Barbados) and Karsten Sach (Germany). The contact  group met between 29 November and 6 December to discuss these  items, and those from the Financial Mechanism (Kyoto Protocol)  COP/MOP agenda item. The COP/MOP adopted decisions on these items  on 9 December.

###     Adaptation Fund

Preliminary discussion of this item was held in  the contact group on 29 November. Discussion was then held  informally until the contact group finalized discussions on 6  December. After extensive procedural debate, discussions began on  a Co-Chairs' text, with delegates seeking to include elements of  one or both of the G-77/China and EU proposals into that text. A  key area of discussion was whether the GEF should serve as the  financial mechanism for the Fund, with the G-77/China believing  that this might not be the best option, and stressing the need to  develop a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the COP/MOP  and the operating entity of the Fund, and to avoid the 'onerous  operational policies on eligibility criteria,' including  'incremental costs.' The EU proposed a sliding-scale on co- financing to measure additional costs.

At the last contact group meeting on 6 December, the Co-Chairs  suggested, and parties agreed, to delete the bracketed sections of  the draft decision, which deal with eligibility criteria and other  elements of the fund, and to forward draft conclusions and a draft  COP/MOP decision to the SBI, which adopted these conclusions in  plenary later that day. The COP/MOP adopted the decision on 9  December, at which time Canada noted its commitment to addressing  urgent adaptation needs and pledged C$5 million for the Adaptation  Fund. Japan stressed that the GEF should be the operating entity  for the Adaptation Fund.

###     COP/MOP Decision

The COP/MOP decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.32)  contains reference to the purpose of the Fund and guidance on its  operating policies, programme priorities, and eligibility criteria  for its operation, which will be adopted at COP MOP 2. It also  requests the submission of views on policies, programme priorities  and eligibility criteria for consideration at SBI 24, and guidance  on a workshop on further guidance for operation of the Fund before  SBI 24.

###     Guidance to the Global Environment Facility

This item was  addressed at the contact group meetings on 29 November and  2 December. Discussion centered on whether a COP/MOP decision  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.33) to apply the current MOU between the COP and  GEF to the COP/MOP was necessary. The G-77/China argued that there  was no need for another MOU since the existing MOU already covers  the Convention, while Japan, the EU and Switzerland said the MOU  was needed. Lacking agreement, SBI decided to forward the draft  decision to SBI 24 for further consideration.

###     Report of the GEF to the COP

This item was first addressed at the  SBI plenary on 29 November, at which time the Philippines, for the  G-77/China, raised concerns about the new GEF Resource Allocation  Framework and GEF co-financing requirements. The contact group  then discussed this issue beginning on 2 December until the SBI  adopted a draft decision on 6 December. The decision was adopted  by the COP/MOP on 9 December.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In its decision (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.30), the  COP/MOP, inter alia: considers the report of the Global  Environment Facility (FCC/CP/2005/3) and takes note of information  provided by the GEF on its support for project-related activities  in the climate change focal area, the Resource Allocation  Framework, and progress on the fourth replenishment of the GEF  Trust Fund.

# QUANTIFIED EMISSION REDUCTION COMMITMENT FOR BELARUS

A request by Belarus to be assigned an emissions target under the  Kyoto Protocol was first communicated to the UNFCCC Secretariat in  October 2005, and subsequently added to the COP/MOP 1 agenda. The  issue was taken up at COP/MOP 1 on 30 November, when Belarus  expressed its desire to take on emissions reduction commitments  and become an Annex B Party to the Protocol. During informal  consultations convened by Andrej Kranjc (Slovenia), several  countries raised concerns that an amendment to the Protocol would  be needed for Belarus to become an Annex B Party. After further  consultations, delegates were unable to agree on Belarus's  request, but did agree to invite a submission from Belarus  containing a proposal for an amendment. The decision was adopted  by the COP/MOP on 9 December.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In this decision (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.10), the  COP/MOP acknowledges the intention of Belarus to be assigned a  quantified emission limitation and reduction commitment under  Protocol Article 3 for the period 2008 to 2012, and invites  Belarus to submit text for a proposed amendment to Annex B.

# OTHER MATTERS

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES UNDER THE PROTOCOL

Criteria for Cases of  Failure to Submit Information under Article 3.3 and 3.4: Parties  addressed this issue in SBSTA plenary on 29 November and in a  contact group co-chaired by Newton Paciornik (Brazil) and Audun  Rosland (Norway), as well as in informal consultations involving a  smaller group of experts. The issue entailed the development of  criteria to apply in cases of failure to submit information  relating to estimates of greenhouse gas emissions by sources and  removals by sinks from activities under Protocol Article 3.3 and  3.4 (LULUCF), by applying a 'magnitude of the adjustments to an  activity,' expressed as a percentage. This magnitude is calculated  through a mathematical equation, the result of which gives a  threshold above which removal units cannot be issued. Draft SBSTA  conclusions recommending a decision to the COP/MOP were adopted by  SBSTA on 6 December. The COP/MOP decision was adopted in plenary  on 9 December.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.18/Add.1),  the COP/MOP agrees that an Annex I Party shall not issue removal  units (RMUs) for a specific activity under Protocol Article 3.3  and 3.4, associated with the year of the commitment period if the  magnitude of the adjustments to that activity, as defined in a  mathematical equation in the annex to the decision, exceeds 9% for  that year. The COP/MOP further decides that the magnitude of the  adjustment shall be included in the review reports under Protocol  Article 8 (review).

Implications of Project Activities under the CDM for Achieving the  Aims of Other Environmental Treaties: This issue was first taken  up in SBSTA plenary on 29 November, and subsequently in three  contact group meetings chaired by Georg Børsting (Norway) held  from 1-5 December, and in informal consultations. It addresses the  implications of the establishment of new HCFC-22 facilities  seeking to obtain CERs for the destruction of HFC-23. HCFC-22 is a  greenhouse gas and an ozone-depleting substance controlled by the  Montreal Protocol. Its consumption for non-feedstock purposes is  being phased out in developed countries, and is to be frozen in  developing countries at 2015 levels. HFC-23, a by-product of the  manufacture of HCFC-22, is a potent greenhouse gas regulated by  the Kyoto Protocol. Given the potency of HFC-23 and the relatively  low cost of destroying it, a CDM project activity to destroy waste  HFC-23 can result in substantial financial benefits for an HCFC-22  plant, to the point where the revenue from the sale of CERs could  exceed the revenue from the sale of the HCFC-22 produced.

Parties agreed on the need to address perverse incentives from the  crediting of HFC-23 destruction under the CDM that could result in  increased production of HCFC-22. But views varied widely as to how  to address them. Many developing countries, including Brazil,  India, Mexico, Bolivia and others, proposed to exclude such  project activities from the CDM. China, Canada and others  suggested allowing HFC-23 destruction projects subject to certain  provisions. The EU, Switzerland and others also supported  exclusion, but said they could consider allowing them if  provisions effectively prevented perverse incentives. Given the  limited time available and the technical complexity of the issue,  parties decided to further consider the issue at SBSTA 24. They  did, however, agree on the importance of avoiding perverse  incentives, and on the definition of a new HCFC-22 facility, a  technical matter that should facilitate progress at the next  session.

###     COP/MOP Decision

In the decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.27/Add.1),  the COP/MOP: states that HCFC-22 used as feedstock in the  manufacture of other chemicals is not controlled under the  Montreal Protocol; defines 'new HCFC-22 facilities'; and  recognizes that issuing CERs for HFC-23 destruction at new HCFC-22  facilities could lead to higher global production of HCFC-22  and/or HFC-23. The COP/MOP further recognizes that the destruction  of HFC-23 is an important measure to mitigate greenhouse gas  emissions, and encourages Annex I Parties and multilateral  financial institutions to provide funding for destruction of  HFC-23 in non-Annex I Parties. The COP/MOP also requests SBSTA to  continue deliberations on the issue with a view to preparing a  draft recommendation with guidance to the CDM Executive Board for  adoption at COP/MOP 2.

### ITALY'S ASSIGNED AMOUNT FOR FOREST MANAGEMENT

In the COP/MOP  plenary on 30 November, the EU introduced a request by Italy to  reconsider its assigned amount for forest management under Kyoto  Protocol Article 3.4 (land use, land-use change and forestry).  Consultations were undertaken by Thelma Krug (Brazil), and COP/MOP  President Dion announced in plenary on 9 December that he had  developed draft President's conclusions on the matter based on the  outcome of the consultations. The COP/MOP agreed to the conclusions.

###     COP/MOP Conclusions

The conclusions (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.4) note  Italy's submission on this matter (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/MISC.2),  request SBSTA to consider the request and forward a draft decision  for adoption at COP/MOP 2. The conclusions also request Italy to  submit country-specific data to the Secretariat in a timely manner  so as to facilitate SBSTA's discussions.

# HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

The joint high-level segment of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 began on  7 December and concluded on 9 December. During the segment, more  than 120 ministers and other high-level government officials  delivered statements, along with senior representatives of  intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, UN bodies  and specialized agencies, and other relevant groups. Speakers  reflected on a wide range of issues relating to climate change,  the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.

This section of the summary reflects on some of the key issues  raised. For more detailed written reports on the high-level  segment, see: http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12289e.html and  http://www.iisd.ca/vol12/enb12290e.html. Complete webcast records  of these speeches are available online at:  http://unfccc.streamlogics.com/unfccc/agenda.asp.

### OPENING OF THE HIGH-LEVEL SEGMENT

COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 President  Stéphane Dion outlined progress on what he referred to as the  'three I's' of 'implementation, improvement, and innovation.' On  implementation, he highlighted adoption of the Marrakesh Accords  and the compliance mechanism, while on improvement he cited  initiatives on adaptation and the CDM. On innovation, he said  parties must demonstrate a strong commitment to Protocol Article  3.9, but that action under Article 3.9 was only part of the  solution. Parties also heard statements from UN Deputy  Secretary-General Louise Fréchette, UNFCCC Acting Executive  Secretary Richard Kinley, and Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin,  who underscored climate change as a global challenge that requires  a global response from all countries.

### COUNTRY STATEMENTS

Government speakers reflected on issues such  as adaptation to climate change, avoided deforestation, extreme  weather events, the Kyoto Protocol's flexible mechanisms, reform  of the CDM, funding and capacity building, commitments under the  UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, funding and capacity building,  mitigation, observation systems, the post-2012 process, synergies  and cooperation, technology development and transfer, and the  adoption of the Marrakesh Accords.

###     Adaptation

Many speakers, including Australia, Mexico and Panama,  spoke about adapting to the effects of climate change. In this  regard, the needs of LDCs and SIDS were particularly emphasized,  and the five-year programme of work on adaptation was discussed.

###     Avoided Deforestation

Several parties discussed a proposal by  Papua New Guinea to provide incentives to developing countries for  avoided deforestation.

###     Commitments

Numerous speakers pledged to meet commitments under  the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. Developing countries, in particular,  urged Annex I Parties to honor their pledges under the Protocol.

###     Extreme Weather Events

The impact of recent extreme weather  events and linkages to climate change were discussed by many  speakers, including Jamaica, speaking for the G-77/China, and  Mauritius, on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States.  Several speakers raised the issue of early warning systems to help  reduce the impacts of extreme events.

###     Flexible Mechanisms

The CDM was a particular focus of  discussions, with many highlighting the need to improve or  streamline the CDM. Other issues raised included: the link between  the CDM and poverty reduction; the importance of maintaining the  environmental integrity of the CDM; the need to ensure equitable  geographic distribution of CDM projects, and particularly to  expand the number of CDM projects in Africa; and the impact of the  EU emissions trading scheme.

###     Funding and Capacity Building

Many speakers, particularly those  from developing countries, highlighted the importance of adequate  funding and capacity building, and some urged Annex I Parties to  honor their commitments. Bangladesh, on behalf of LDCs, called for  compensation for damages caused by climate change, supported  adaptation efforts and implementation of National Adaptation  Programmes of Action. Parties also urged support for the  Adaptation Fund and Special Climate Change Fund.

###     Mitigation

Developed countries in particular reflected on their  activities, with Sweden highlighting its success in decoupling  economic growth from emissions and Japan reporting on its range of  domestic efforts, including awareness raising activities.

###     Post-2012

Most participants commented on the issue of post-2012  action. Many supported launching a process at this conference,  while a large number of speakers also stressed the principle of  common but differentiated responsibilities. Several specifically  supported COP President Dion's proposal for an inclusive process  under the UNFCCC, while the G-77/China supported addressing future  Annex I commitments under Protocol Article 3.9 (future  commitments). Some, including Canada, also favored a 'two-track'  approach encompassing a process under both the UNFCCC and the  Protocol. Australia said the UNFCCC approach reflected that fact  that some Parties will not participate in Kyoto-style national  targets. Switzerland emphasized its commitment to continue the  Protocol beyond 2012, while stressing the need to expand the  multilateral framework.

###     Technology Development and Transfer

Parties supported a strong  focus on technology development and transfer. Issues raised  included access to clean technology, energy conservation, and  carbon dioxide capture and storage.

### STATEMENTS FROM UN BODIES AND AGENCIES

The World Meteorological  Organization highlighted the value of climate monitoring and  research that involves national meteorological services and  developing countries. The UN Department of Economic and Social  Affairs recalled the 2005 World Summit's conclusions and  emphasized the need to integrate climate and development policies.  The UN Environment Programme highlighted links to the Millennium  Development Goals and urged faster and deeper emissions  reductions. The International Civil Aviation Organization listed  technical standards, optimized controls, shorter routings and  emissions trading as options to reduce aviation emissions. The  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change updated parties on the  Fourth Assessment Report, and the Global Environment Facility  explained the positive impacts of the Resource Allocation  Framework and noted ongoing negotiations on the GEF's fourth  replenishment. The Convention on Biological Diversity said climate  change is one of the drivers for biodiversity loss and the  Convention to Combat Desertification urged strengthened  collaboration.

### STATEMENTS FROM OBSERVER ORGANIZATIONS

The International Energy  Agency highlighted the importance of emissions trading mechanisms,  energy efficiency, and technology development to transform the  world's energy systems. The IUCN-World Conservation Union appealed  to governments to move forward on actions that recognize the  collective responsibility for climate change and its impacts, and  supported mainstreaming climate change measures into the wider  development framework. The International Institute of  Refrigeration stressed the need to continue to phase out  chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, since these have both  ozone-depleting and global warming effects. The International  Council for Local Environmental Initiatives emphasized local  governments' commitment to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050. The  International Confederation of Free Trade Unions emphasized  unions' potential to contribute to the climate process by  mobilizing millions of workers. Indigenous peoples organizations  highlighted the importance of indigenous peoples and their  participation in the climate process. Calling for effective  action, a group of independent organizations emphasized their  capacity to assist governments and add value to formulating  climate policies.

The Arctic Council highlighted climate change impacts on  indigenous communities. The International Federation of  Agricultural Producers underscored the role of agricultural  producers in combating the impacts of climate change. Women's  groups urged consideration of gender perspectives within the  climate change process, especially in adaptation measures and  projects.

Business and industry organizations reflected on the challenges  involved in evolving into low-carbon economies, and highlighted  the need for certainty and long-term policies to foster investment  and development of new technologies. Climate Action Network  International highlighted adaptation and financing issues, and  said no single government will be able to hold up the climate  change process. Youth organizations urged a strong post 2012  regime, and the World Council of Churches said life and the  atmosphere are sacred gifts and should be protected.

# CLOSING COP AND COP/MOP PLENARY

Early on Saturday morning, 10 December, after all-night  negotiations on the package on future actions, President Dion  convened the closing plenary. Parties adopted the reports of the  COP/MOP (FCCC/KP/CMP/2005/L.1 and Add.1) and COP (FCCC/CP/2005/L.1  and Add.1) shortly after 6:00 am. Parties had also earlier also  adopted the reports of the subsidiary bodies (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/4  and Add.1 and Amend.1; FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.15; FCCC/SBI/2005/10 and  Add.1; FCCC/SBI/2005/L.16).

In his closing speech, President Dion reflected the outcomes from  both COP 11 and COP/MOP 1, stating that the Kyoto Protocol is now  fully operational. On the Protocol, he observed that the CDM has  been strengthened and streamlined, and is better funded to handle  an increase in demand for project approvals. He also noted the  launch of the JI supervisory committee.

President Dion drew attention to agreement on a way forward on the  Adaptation Fund. He also noted that discussions have been  initiated on the future under both the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol,  sending a strong signal to the carbon market and creating  incentives for investment. In addition, submissions have been  requested by 1 September 2006 on Protocol Article 9 (review of the  Protocol). He explained that 'we have achieved what many claimed  was unattainable - a process on enhancing implementation under the  UNFCCC.' He stated that there is now a forum to find innovative  solutions, and referred to this package of agreements as the  'Montreal Action Plan,' which he described as a 'clear roadmap for  future work under the Convention.' Reflecting on the past two weeks of meetings, he said participants  had delivered on an extremely ambitious agenda, adopting more than  40 significant decisions. He praised the Canadian delegation, the  'wonderful' UNFCCC Secretariat team, Canada's Foreign Affairs  Minister Pierre Pettigrew, former US President Bill Clinton, and  former UNFCCC Executive Secretary Michael Zammit Cutajar, who he  described as the 'hero of a new episode of climate diplomacy' for  his work in the negotiations. He thanked delegates and  participants for making this meeting a success. Congratulating  parties on completing the 'Montreal marathon,' he added that there  is still a long race to run but that, thanks to the Montreal  Action Plan, 'we will be able to run this together.' He gaveled  the meeting to a close at 6:17 am on Saturday morning, 10 December  2005.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF COP 11 & COP/MOP 1 'THE I'S OF THE WORLD ARE WATCHING'

While expectations for the eleventh session of the Conference of  the Parties to the Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 11)  and the Conference of the Parties serving as the first Meeting of  the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP 1) varied greatly, for  those who support multilateral efforts to address climate change  it was clear that some form of success was imperative. A  successful outcome in Montreal would not only serve to  operationalize the Protocol, it could also send a positive signal  around the world about the future of the climate regime beyond the  end of the first commitment period in 2012. Failure could  undermine the Protocol in the near-term and send mixed, or even  negative, signals about the future.

On the first day of the meetings, COP and COP/MOP President  Stéphane Dion outlined his key goals, which he called the three  'I's. According to Dion, delegates needed to: 'implement' the  Protocol, especially the Marrakesh Accords, and other decisions  needed to make the Protocol function effectively; 'improve' the  operation of the Protocol and the Convention; and 'innovate' by  exploring 'options for future cooperation in a manner that  reflects the full range of interests of the Convention.' These  'three I's' became the standards by which the outcomes of the  meetings would be judged.

This brief analysis will consider the successes and/or failures of  COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 through the lens applied by President Dion,  and offer some initial thoughts on the future of the global  climate regime.

# IMPLEMENTATION

The most urgent objective in Montreal was to implement the Kyoto  Protocol. The Protocol's entry into force in February 2005 may  have made it a legal instrument, but without the formal adoption  of the Marrakesh Accords, which set out the technical details that  are key to its functioning and integrity, the utility of the  Protocol and its mechanisms, at least in the near-term, would be  greatly reduced. Many felt that without the Accords the entire  Protocol could unravel and the delicate balance reached at COP 7  in Marrakesh in 2001 would be difficult, if not impossible, to  re-establish.

Despite some nervousness that one or more parties might prevent  adoption of the Marrakesh Accords and obstruct the Protocol,  delegates quickly adopted the Accords and set Protocol  implementation in motion. Even the thorny issue of how to adopt  the compliance mechanism was overcome relatively early in the  second week. Saudi Arabia had invoked Article 18 of the Protocol,  which indicates that in order for this mechanism to be legally  binding, the Protocol must be amended. Since the compliance  mechanism is necessary to define eligibility to use the flexible  mechanisms, most other parties preferred immediately adopting it  by a COP/MOP decision and considering an amendment later. Saudi  Arabia eventually agreed to this approach, possibly due to  pressure from those members of the G-77/China who stand to benefit  from the CDM. By adopting the compliance system, delegates  established the most elaborate compliance regime of any existing  multilateral environmental agreement.

Even those elements that were not fully resolved, including the  Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation Fund, were safely  pushed to the next meetings of the subsidiary bodies for  consideration. In the meantime, the major operational pieces of  the Protocol, including the flexible mechanisms, will be up and  running, giving carbon markets a major boost.

# IMPROVEMENT

Heading into COP/MOP 1, adaptation and the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) had emerged for many as those items most in need  of 'improvement': the former because its absence from the  Convention has long been seen as a lacuna, and the latter because  a more efficient CDM that can handle a large number of project  proposals is viewed by many as a prerequisite for its success.

When the UNFCCC was adopted in 1992, adaptation was largely seen  as an afterthought to mitigation. In recent years, however,  adaptation has become a key piece of the response to climate  change - so much so that that both COP 8 and COP 10 were dubbed  'the Adaptation COP'- particularly as the effects of climate  change become more evident.

Development of a five-year programme of work on adaptation began  at COP 10, with the expectation that it would be adopted in  Montreal. The challenge, however, was to balance the interests of  developing countries, which had called for an action-oriented  programme that would enable some kind of immediate action, with  those of developed countries, which were more cautious given that  this programme of work could imply additional funding. Although  the initial actions identified in the programme of work are not as  action-oriented as many parties would have liked, the general  objectives appear to address the interests of most developing  countries. Despite the fact that funding to undertake much of the  work is not yet in place, many felt that progress on addressing  adaptation was made.

While formal adoption of the CDM rules by the COP/MOP was achieved  without difficulty, many parties and other actors have pushed hard  for reforms, albeit with different objectives. On the one hand,  the private sector and some developing countries in particular  want to dramatically increase the number of CDM projects. They  have been frustrated at the time taken to secure approval of  projects by the CDM Executive Board, and want to clear the  'logjam.' Some also want to expand the type of projects that can  be approved. On the other hand, many NGOs and parties such as  small island states have emphasized the need to ensure  environmental integrity of emissions reductions from the CDM. 'We  want more projects, but not if it means more bad projects,' said  one expert.

The COP/MOP adopted a decision that seems to strike a reasonable  balance between these objectives. Most importantly, it outlines  measures relating to the Board's functioning, transparency and  efficiency. In addition to a decision to levy US$0.10 to US$0.20  per Certified Emissions Reduction for administrative expenses,  Annex I countries responded to the CDM Executive Board's financing  gap by pledging US$8,188,050 in funds. The decision also requests  the Board to consider new ways of demonstrating additionality and  carry out further work on certain project types and methodologies.  The outcome may not be exactly what either side wanted, but it  struck a necessary balance and will enable the CDM to go forward.

# INNOVATION

By the time the last plenary sessions of the COP and COP/MOP began  in the small hours of Saturday morning, some delegates were  already giving the meeting an A' grade. This was even before the  adoption of decisions under Protocol Article 3.9 (Future  Commitments) and President's Dion's paper on a dialogue on long- term cooperative action for all UNFCCC Parties.

There is little doubt that this final I' was the most difficult  of the three objectives. It was also in many ways the most  important, at least for the global response to climate change  under the UNFCCC umbrella. Even if the Kyoto Protocol could  function without a clear direction on the way forward beyond 2012,  without a longer-term signal to the international community and  the private sector about future directions, the value of progress  made on implementation and improvement would be significantly  undermined. Business interests have been particularly vocal in  their call for predictability given their long-term investment  horizons.

By advocating for a process to consider the future under both the  Kyoto Protocol and UNFCCC, President Dion sought an outcome that  maintained the momentum and integrity of the Protocol while also  engaging the US and other countries that have not ratified the  Protocol.

The final piece of the 'future commitments' puzzle was to link  these processes to a third - namely the review of the Protocol  mandated under Article 9. As Protocol Article 3.9 only involves  Annex I countries, some hope that this third process will open the  door to some form of commitments by developing countries.

These three processes will run in parallel, thus offering several  possibilities for future action on climate change. It may have  taken delegates into the early hours of Saturday morning to reach  agreement to move forward on all three processes and resulted in  many heart-stopping moments for negotiators, but by the end of the  meeting President Dion was able to declare success on his third  and final I.'

# EVALUATING SUCCESS

As the conference closed on Saturday morning, many delegates and  civil society representatives appeared satisfied that they had  overcome so many potential pitfalls and actually achieved  consensus. However, the simple fact that delegates agreed to  embark on several processes does not indicate the substance of a  future agreement. It is one thing to make progress, but quite  another to achieve long-term success.

Some may argue that President Dion was able to achieve his  objectives by setting the bar low enough that a positive outcome  was almost assured. After all, many of the major battles over the  implementation of the Protocol were fought in 2001. It could also  be argued that the decisions on post-2012 were not sufficiently  specific to guarantee a positive outcome in the long-term.

However, most delegates leaving the Palais des congrès de Montréal  on Saturday morning would say such criticisms are unjustified.  Even several veterans of the process seemed to be in a state of  mild euphoria as the meeting ended. While these three parallel  processes may not commit parties to take any definite action,  agreeing to discuss the future under both the Protocol and the  Convention was more than many felt was achievable at this time.

# AN 'I' TO THE FUTURE

Even though the outcomes of COP 11 and COP/MOP 1 exceeded  expectations, the future of the climate regime is still highly  uncertain. The Russian Federation's last-gasp push to have a  reference to voluntary commitments in the decision on Article 3.9  suggests that they have joined the group of countries that may not  be willing to take on commitments unless large developing  countries are part of a future deal. Other major parties,  including the United States, Australia, India, and China, have  begun to focus on technology development and diffusion via the  Asia-Pacific Partnership, and this focus on technology is also  reflected in the decision to discuss future commitments under the  Convention. How this and other multilateral initiatives ultimately  fit with the UNFCCC process is an issue that will need to be  assessed in the future.

The future may not be clear, but at this critical juncture the  Kyoto Protocol is operational and multiple paths to move forward  within the UN framework have been established. Given the real risk  of failure in Montreal, it is hard to dispute that COP 11/COP/MOP  1 was anything but a success.
