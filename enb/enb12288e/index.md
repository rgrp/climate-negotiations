### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

SBI adopted conclusions on the work of  the Consultative Group of Experts on National Communications from  non-Annex I Parties (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.27), compilation and  synthesis of initial national communications (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.26),  and financial and technical support (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.25/Rev.1).

### FINANCIAL MECHANISM

Adaptation Fund: Delegates considered  financial issues in a contact group and informal discussions. The  Co-Chairs introduced revised text and proposed deleting several  sections of the draft COP/MOP decision. Parties agreed to this  remaining text, which contains, inter alia: the preamble;  reference to the purpose of the Fund; guidance on the operation of  the Fund; further guidance on policies, programme priorities and  eligibility criteria for its operation that will be adopted at COP  MOP 2; text on the submission of views on policies, programme  priorities and eligibility criteria for consideration at SBI 24;  and guidance on a workshop on further guidance for operation of  the Fund before SBI 24.

The approved language was submitted to SBI later in the day, and  SBI adopted conclusions and a draft COP/MOP decision  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.32). Contact group Co-Chair Rawleston Moore  (Barbados) noted that more work was needed on this issue at  future meetings.

###     Guidance to the GEF

Delegates continued discussions in a contact  group, considering a revised draft decision that would apply the  current MOU between the COP and the GEF to the COP/MOP and GEF.  South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, said there was no need for an  MOU given that the existing MOU covers the Convention. JAPAN, the  EU, and SWITZERLAND said the MOU was needed and supported the  draft. SBI Chair Becker reported to plenary on lack of agreement,  and the item was forwarded to SBI 24 for further consideration.

###     Special Climate Change Fund

With no agreement on his proposal to  remove the remaining brackets in the draft conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2005/L.34), Chair Becker introduced new conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2005/CRP.4). South Africa, for the G-77/CHINA, did not  support the Chair's text and proposed forwarding both the text  from SBI 22 (FCCC/SBI/2005/10 Annex 1) and the G-77/CHINA  submission to SB 24 for consideration.

# SBSTA

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES UNDER THE PROTOCOL

SBSTA adopted  conclusions on criteria for cases of failure to submit information  relating to estimates of greenhouse gas emissions and a draft  COP/MOP decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.18 & Add.1). SBSTA also  adopted conclusions and a draft COP/MOP decision on implications  of the implementation of project activities under the CDM for the  achievement of objectives of other environmental conventions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.27 & Add.1).

### METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES UNDER THE CONVENTION

SBSTA adopted  conclusions on harvested wood products (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.16) and  conclusions and a draft COP decision on the common reporting  format (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.19 & Add.1).

Emissions from Fuel Used for International Aviation and Maritime  Transport: Jos√© Romero (Switzerland) reported to SBSTA that no  consensus had been reached in consultations. The EU and NORWAY,  opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, requested more time to negotiate.  Informal consultations resumed, but bracketed text remained  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/CRP.1). In plenary, the EU, SOUTH AFRICA, JAPAN,  AUSTRALIA, CHILE, AOSIS and others supported deleting brackets and  approving the document, while SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT and LIBYA  opposed the text. CHINA and ALGERIA supported Chair Benrageb's  proposal to postpone the issue until SBSTA 24. No agreement was  reached and SBSTA instead adopted brief conclusions forwarding the  matter to SBSTA 24 (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.28).

### INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTION LOG

SBSTA adopted conclusions and a  draft COP/MOP decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.20 &Add.1).

### SIDS

Chair Benrageb proposed holding the agenda item on follow up  to the International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the  Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of SIDS in  abeyance. The US opposed this, stating that it considers that the  issue was concluded at SBSTA 22. Tuvalu, for AOSIS, stressed that  the Mauritius Strategy has been accepted as the UN programme for  SIDS, and is recognized by the General Assembly. The EU and  AUSTRALIA expressed disappointment that no progress was made. The  matter was taken up in informal consultations to decide whether  the issue should remain on SBSTA's agenda. Following discussions  on the usefulness of holding an item in abeyance ad infinitum as  opposed to exploring other options such as side events or  workshops, Parties finally agreed at 12:30 am to include this item  in the provisional agenda for SBSTA 24.

### TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

On development and transfer of technologies,  SBSTA adopted conclusions on matters relating to the  implementation of the framework (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.24) and the  Work Programme of the EGTT for 2006 (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.23) and a  draft COP decision (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.24/Add.1).

### RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC OBSERVATION

SBSTA adopted conclusions  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.17).

### COOPERATION WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

Parties adopted conclusions,  including text on carbon dioxide capture and storage  (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.26).

### OTHER MATTERS

SBSTA adopted conclusions on various progress  reports (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.25). On issues relating to  implementation of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects),  Vice-Chair Abdulla reported that informal consultations had not  produced an agreement. SAUDI ARABIA and NIGERIA expressed  dissatisfaction with the way the item had been handled. SBSTA  adopted conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.22) noting that the issue  would be taken up again at SBSTA 24.

### MITIGATION

Consideration of this issue resumed in a morning  contact group, following informal consultations that continued  until late Monday night. Differences on lessons learned and  historical and per capita greenhouse gas emissions were dealt with  by deleting all references to those issues. A contentious  paragraph on the preparation of technical papers by the  Secretariat for workshops was deleted. Late on Tuesday night, the  matter was reported back to SBSTA, which adopted the conclusions  on this item (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.29). However, the EU expressed  disappointment that it had not been possible to agree to a more  ambitious programme.

### ADAPTATION

Following extensive consultations, SBSTA adopted  conclusions and forwarded a bracketed draft decision to the COP  for its consideration (FCCC/SBSTA/2005/L.30 & Add.1).

### REPORT OF SBSTA 23

SBSTA agreed to the report of the session  (FCCC/2005/SBSTA/L.15). Chair Benrageb thanked delegates for their  hard work. Many Parties thanked Chair Benrageb for his excellent  efforts over the past two years, and the Chair declared SBSTA 23  closed shortly after 1:30 am.

# COP AND COP/MOP CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Dovland noted that an agreement had not been  possible even after several informal consultations. He explained  that the key differences still related to how the compliance  mechanism should be adopted at COP/MOP 1, and how the process will  continue regarding an amendment to the Protocol to make the system  legally binding. He said the outstanding questions would be solved  either through further informal consultations or by President  Dion. Although differences narrowed, no agreement was reached  during informal consultations on Tuesday afternoon.

### JOINT IMPLEMENTATION (JI)

In the contact group, Chair Stoycheva  explained that she had held 'Friends of the Chair' consultations  late on Monday evening, and informal consultations earlier on  Tuesday. Significant progress had been made in removing brackets  from the text. After further discussion, Parties were able to  agree that DOEs can be provisionally used in determining JI  projects but such determinations will only be valid after the DOE  has been accredited as an independent entity by the JI Supervisory  Committee. The contact group concluded its work and has forwarded  the decision to COP/MOP 1 for adoption.

### DEFORESTATION IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

Delegates resumed informal  consultations and agreed to a draft COP decision inviting  submissions from Parties and accredited observers by 31 March 2006  on relevant scientific, technical and methodological issues, and  on the exchange of relevant information, including policy  approaches and positive incentives. The COP also invites  recommendations on any further process to consider these issues.  These submissions will be considered by SBSTA 24, in order to  report on this issue at SBSTA 27. The COP further requests SBSTA  to organize a workshop before SBSTA 25.

### CDM EXECUTIVE BOARD REPORT

Delegates met informally to consider  outstanding issues in the Co-Chairs' draft decision. Progress was  made throughout the day but negotiations were still continuing on  Tuesday night.

### ARTICLE 3.9 (FUTURE COMMITMENTS)

Delegates continued to meet  informally to consider future commitments under the Protocol.  Consultations were still ongoing on Tuesday night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

On a very late night for SBSTA, some delegates were heard  expressing their disappointment that the Mauritius Strategy for  SIDS failed to make it onto the agenda of this SBSTA. Although  many Parties appeared to favor consideration of this item, the US  was vigorous in its objections, citing procedural issues. 'Small  island States are being drowned out by the large mainland States,'  alleged one observer. For its part, the US has argued forcefully  that the issue has already been given thorough consideration in  other fora and that this is not the right place for this discussion.

In other news, several delegates appeared optimistic about  President Dion's initiative on moving forward under the Convention  following Dion's meeting Tuesday lunchtime with ministers at the  InterContinental Hotel.
