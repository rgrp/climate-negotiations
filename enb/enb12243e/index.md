abstract: "The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)  workshop on emissions projections from Parties included in Annex I  of the UNFCCC was held from 6-8 September 2004, at the  Wissenschaftszentrum in Bonn, Germany. Over 80 participants from  Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, as well as non-governmental  organizations, were in attendance. The workshop represented the  first occasion for Parties to consider emissions projections  in detail."
---

The workshop was mandated by SBSTA-19, which requested the UNFCCC  Secretariat to organize a workshop to support the preparation of  the fourth national communications of Annex I Parties. The purpose  of the workshop was to address methods, assumptions, indicators,  key parameters of models and sensitivity analysis, and  dissemination of methodologies for estimating emissions  projections. A report on the workshop will be prepared by the  Secretariat for consideration by SBSTA-21, meeting in conjunction  with the tenth Conference of the Parties (COP-10) in December  2004, in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

During the workshop, participants met in plenary and parallel  sessions to address a number of challenges and exchange  experiences related to projecting greenhouse gas emissions. On  Monday, 6 September, they addressed general and cross-cutting  issues and heard presentations on national experiences that were  followed by question and answer sessions. In the afternoon,  participants discussed questions raised in a working paper on  general and cross-cutting issues prepared by the Secretariat for  the workshop. On Tuesday, 7 September, participants met in two  parallel groups to discuss specific issues relating to energy,  industry and waste, and specific issues relating to agriculture,  land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Each group heard  presentations on national circumstances, most of which were  followed by a question and answer session, and addressed questions  raised in two working papers on energy, industry and waste, and  agriculture and LULUCF, respectively. On Wednesday, 8 September,  participants met in plenary to consider the discussion outcomes,  pending issues, recommendations and conclusions.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF EMISSIONS PROJECTIONS UNDER THE UNFCCC

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  sustainable development, with adverse impacts expected on human  health, food security, economic activity, water and other natural  resources, and physical infrastructure. Global climate varies  naturally, but scientists agree that rising concentrations of  anthropogenically-emitted greenhouse gases in the Earth's  atmosphere are leading to changes in the climate.

Scientific observations on climate change were brought to  policy-makers' attention in the late 1970s. Scientific uncertainty  was high, and debate on whether or how to take action took place  throughout the 1980s. By the end of the decade, the international  community had agreed that a global framework for action was  necessary to stabilize the atmospheric concentrations of  greenhouse gases in order to avoid 'dangerous anthropogenic  interference' with the climate system. Gases that were considered  necessary to control included methane, nitrous oxide, and, in  particular, carbon dioxide.

Negotiations on the UNFCCC began in 1991, and governments adopted  it in June 1992. The UNFCCC entered into force on 21 March 1994,  and now has 189 Parties.

### KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference of  the Parties to the UNFCCC (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on  the Berlin Mandate to negotiate action for the period beyond 2000,  including the strengthening of the commitments of Annex I Parties  through the adoption of a protocol or another legal instrument.  Following intense negotiations that concluded at COP-3 in Kyoto,  Japan, in December 1997, delegates agreed to a Protocol to the  UNFCCC that commits developed countries and countries with  economies in transition (EITs) to achieve quantified emissions  reduction targets. These countries, known under the UNFCCC as  Annex I Parties, agreed to reduce their overall emissions of six  greenhouse gases by at least 5% below 1990 levels between 2008 and  2012 (the first commitment period), with specific targets varying  from country to country. Gases included are carbon dioxide,  methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons (PFCs),  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride.

Since COP-3, Parties have negotiated most of the rules and  operational details determining how to reduce emissions and  measure and assess these emissions reductions. To enter into  force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the UNFCCC,  and by Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the total  carbon dioxide emissions for Annex I Parties in 1990. To date, 124  Parties have ratified the Protocol, including 32 Annex I Parties  representing 44.2% of the emissions required for entry into force.

### NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

As part of their UNFCCC commitments,  Annex I Parties are required to submit a national communication on  a regular basis (approximately every 4-5 years). At COP-5, which  met in October/November 1999, Parties adopted guidelines for  preparing and reporting Annex I national communications. The  guidelines require Annex I Parties to provide information on:national circumstances relevant to greenhouse gas emissions  and removals; greenhouse gas inventories; vulnerability assessments, climate change impacts and  adaptation measures; financial resources and transfer of technology; research and systematic observation; and education, training and public awareness.

The national communications also request information on policies  and measures (P&Ms) implemented by Parties to mitigate emissions,  and projections of emissions estimates up to 2020 for all sectors.  The majority of Annex I Parties are now in the process of  preparing their fourth national communications, due for submission  by 1 January 2006.

### WORKSHOP BACKGROUND

At SBSTA-19, meeting in conjunction with COP-9,  in December 2003, in Milan, Italy, Parties examined data showing  that, while the aggregate 2000 greenhouse gas emissions of Annex I  Parties were below 1990 levels, these emissions are expected to  increase in the period 2000-2010. Data was compiled based on  information in national communications and from in-depth reviews  of the communications carried out by the Secretariat. As a result  of the data, Parties agreed to take further action to implement  P&Ms to contribute to modifying longer-term trends in emissions.  The COP decided to request the Secretariat to prepare a summary  report of the in-depth reviews of Annex I national communications,  as well as to organize a workshop to facilitate timely submission  of fourth national communications. SBSTA-19 also agreed that a  workshop on emissions projections was necessary in order to  support the preparation of fourth national communications.

# REPORT OF THE WORKSHOP

Halld√≥r Thorgeirsson, Coordinator of the Subsidiary Body for  Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), UNFCCC Secretariat,  welcomed participants and read a statement on behalf of SBSTA  Chair Abdullatif Benrageb (Libya), who was unable to be present at  the workshop and, therefore, requested Hans-Joachim Ziesing  (Germany), Micheal Young (Ireland) and Neil Ferry (Australia) to  facilitate the workshop on his behalf.

Stelios Pesmajoglou, UNFCCC Secretariat, recalled the mandate of  the workshop, including to:hold technical discussions on methodological issues relating  to the preparation of greenhouse gas emissions projections; hold an open exchange of views and experiences in preparing  projections; discuss lessons learned and identify areas for further  improvement; and address methods, assumptions, indicators, key parameters,  sensitivity analysis and dissemination of methodologies for  emissions projections.

He observed that findings during in-depth reviews and reflected in  the compilation and synthesis (C&S) of third Annex I national  communications indicate shortcomings in the projection of emissions.  He said the three working papers prepared by the Secretariat for the  workshop highlight issues for participants to discuss and are based  on the C&S of third national communications, in-depth reviews, views  of Parties, and Secretariat experience. He said the workshop was  expected to provide a report to SBSTA-21 containing conclusions  and/or recommendations, including on methodological challenges to  preparing greenhouse gas projections to assist in the preparation  of Annex I fourth national communications.

Electronic versions of the presentations are available on the  UNFCCC Website:   http://unfccc.int/sessions/workshop/060904/present.html

# GENERAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES

The discussion on general and cross-cutting issues was chaired by  Hans-Joachim Ziesing.

Sergey Kononov, UNFCCC Secretariat, introduced the three working  papers prepared for the workshop on: general and cross-cutting  issues (Working Paper 1,  http://unfccc.int/sessions/workshop/060904/documents/workpaper_1.pdf); issues in the preparation of greenhouse gas projections for  the energy sector, transport, industry and waste management  (Working Paper 2,  http://unfccc.int/sessions/workshop/060904/documents/workpaper_2.pdf);  and issues in the preparation of greenhouse gas projections for  agriculture and LULUCF (Working Paper 3,  http://unfccc.int/sessions/workshop/060904/documents/workpaper_3.pdf).

He noted that Working Paper 1 distinguishes between issues related  to the reporting of projections, including compliance with the  UNFCCC guidelines on national communications, and issues related  to methodologies used to develop the projections, including  preparation of scenarios, key modeling problems, uncertainties,  and other issues.

### PRESENTATIONS ON NATIONAL EXPERIENCES

Francis Bossier, Federal  Planning Bureau, Belgium, described the methodology used to  develop emissions projections in his country's third national  communication, which includes a combination of models for  projections to 2010 and 2020, taking into account scenarios 'with  measures' and 'with additional measures,' such as the introduction  of a carbon dioxide tax and the effects of non-fiscal measures. He  noted problems with data quality and with the use of a combination  of models and underlined the need to quantify uncertainties.

Participants discussed difficulties in incorporating different  regional policies and integrating additional non-fiscal measures.  Bossier emphasized the importance of presenting contrasting  scenarios, to avoid giving simplistic signals to policymakers.

Takaaki Ito, Ministry of Environment, Japan, said the national  Guideline for Measures to Prevent Global Warming, adopted in March  2002, is being updated. He described methods used by Japan to  project emissions of different sectors. Ito highlighted three  problems: projecting emissions for the land-use change and  forestry (LUCF) sector; estimating business as usual emissions;  and lack of data in the residential and commercial sectors.

Leonard Brown, Climate Change Office, New Zealand, presented on  projecting greenhouse gas emissions and removals in his country.  He reflected on whether the interests of those using projections,  apart from UNFCCC Parties, should be considered. He said  documentation on models presented in national communications  should enable verification and duplication. He highlighted the  importance of consistency in key assumptions, such as gross  domestic product (GDP), across sectors and models, and pointed to  work on quantitative uncertainty estimation. He noted  inconsistencies between the need for short-term projections for  meeting Protocol targets, long-term projections resulting from  models, and UNFCCC requirements for medium-term projections.

Andrea Edelmann, Environment Agency, Austria, presented on the  Austrian experience with emissions projections, emphasizing two  main challenges: institutional arrangements and methodological  issues. She noted that a major administrative effort was required  to incorporate the views of all relevant stakeholders in the  different institutions. On methodological issues, Edelmann  outlined Austria's use of a combination of top-down models with  consistency and bottom-up plausibility checks, and the elaboration  of sensitivity analysis.

Participants discussed the disaggregation of sectors within models,  pessimistic and optimistic projections in the sensitivity analysis,  and communication between different sectors and institutions.  Replying to a question on the use of different model types,  Edelmann underscored the importance of considering interlinkages  between sectors as well as of using the same economic parameters  for all calculations.

Stane Mer¬öe, Energy Efficiency Center, Slovenia, presented on the  methods and challenges in Slovenian emissions projections. He said  Slovenia faces a challenging task in meeting its emissions  reduction commitments, but pointed to awareness raised by the  European Union (EU) Emission Trading Scheme, which is leading to  better greenhouse gas inventories. He said policies related to  greenhouse gas control have recently been incorporated into  energy policy.

Mer¬öe noted both advantages and disadvantages in projecting  emissions due to Slovenia's small size. While it enables individual  treatment of the main greenhouse gas sources, he said the  disadvantages include changes in project realization, cross-border  influence, for instance in emissions from transport fuels, and the  lack of macroeconomic forecasts. Describing the models used, he  said technology changes for different sectors are also considered.  Responding to a question from China on the source of this  information, Mer¬öe said Slovenia is carrying out energy audits,  and that precise data on some energy technologies is available for  bigger companies. He said the bottom-up technology-oriented approach  used by Slovenia involves data uncertainty, but ensures better  process knowledge.

Anne Kristin Fosli, Ministry of Finance, Norway, spoke on facts  and experiences regarding emissions projections in her country.  She said carbon dioxide projections are based on a macroeconomic  model and combine top-down and bottom-up approaches. She noted  that projections are updated every four years in conjunction with  analysis of the Norwegian economy and observed that updated  projections for 2010 and 2020 will be published in November 2004.  Regarding emissions calculations, she said micro-information, such  as oil-production data, is used to adjust or overrule model  projections. She outlined challenges, including how to: ensure  consistency between macro-level and activity data fed into the  macro model and emissions projections that rely on large amounts  of micro-information; deal with voluntary agreements in  projections and scenarios when measures and emissions reductions  can be achieved anyway; and interpret different scenarios in the  reporting guidelines. Regarding LUCF projections, she said  challenging projections include those for: harvesting rates, as  this is mainly driven by international timber prices; increases in  natural decay due to reduced harvesting rates; changes in soil  carbon stock due to changed harvesting rates; effects of past  measures; and carbon changes in marginal forests.

Responding to a question regarding how P&Ms are implemented in the  models, Fosli said models are updated when P&Ms are implemented.

Hartmut Behrend, Environment Directorate-General, European  Commission (EC), reported on the adoption of a new Monitoring  Decision to harmonize P&Ms in the 25 EU Member States. He said  this decision requires reporting emissions projections every two  years on, inter alia, existing and additional P&Ms, sensitivity  analysis, methodologies, assumptions, models, outputs and inputs,  and four or five parameters for every sector.

Stefan V√∂gele, Systems Analysis and Technology Evaluation, Germany,  presented on the IKARUS model used by Germany in developing  emissions projections and estimating impacts of present and future  policy measures. He pointed to difficulties in comparing results  between simulation and optimization models employed by different  countries, and underlined the importance of developing common  approaches to modeling.

In the discussion that followed, the EC acknowledged the difficulty  of developing a model that would be acceptable to all countries,  but noted that common methods could be developed for use in  different models. Slovenia emphasized the importance of diverse  modeling approaches, but said ideas and knowledge could be  exchanged to get better results. Norway suggested that a model  could be developed for use by the UNFCCC to generate comparable  data for Parties and for comparison with the results arrived at by  countries using different modeling techniques. The EC said a  similar approach was used within the EU, where a common model is  applied to data from Member States, in addition to projections at  the national level. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds  (RSPB) called for greater acknowledgement of the flaws and  shortcomings of projection models.

Neil Ferry, Australian Greenhouse Office, elaborated on key  features of Australian emissions projections. He said Australia  employs multiple models for key sectors, including a combination  of bottom-up and top-down models. He explained that the purpose of  this is to reflect the diversity that exists as a result of  different views on key variables among modeling groups, but noted  difficulty in reconciling different model results. He highlighted  the importance of stakeholder involvement. Ferry said that  Australia does 'with measures' but not 'with additional measures'  scenarios. He pointed to the difficulties in estimating impacts of  policy measures, and said policy modeling is done using separate  models.

Highlighting the different results, Germany asked how the 'correct'  projection is assessed. Ferry said only averages of top-down and  bottom-up models are carried out. China asked whether the driving  forces in different models are compared, and Ferry said this is  now being done. Chair Ziesing asked whether discussions with  stakeholders influence the results, and whether this improves the  quality of the projections. Ferry said stakeholder consultations  influence the reports, and models can now be adjusted according  to stakeholder comments. He expected the quality of projections  to improve.

Erik Rasmussen, Environmental Protection Agency, Denmark, outlined  his country's experience with emissions projections. He showed  differing results from previous and updated inventories and  differences in projections between 1990 and 2004 due to changes in  methodologies and emission factors. Noting Denmark's role in  energy export and expectations of increased investment in wind  turbines, Rasmussen emphasized the need to take Protocol-related  activities, climate variability, and investment in capacity  development into account in modeling projections.

Christo Christov, Energy Institute, Bulgaria, presented the  challenges faced by Bulgaria in projecting emissions. He noted his  government's lack of involvement in emissions projections, as a  result of Bulgaria's excess of assigned emissions units. He  pointed to several problems in projecting emissions, including:the use of old methodologies due to lack of capacity; privatization of industry; experts from relevant ministries are not connected with  reporting on, and control and planning of, sectoral activities;  and lack of capacity to forecast the development of industry and  services.

Highlighting needs, Christov urged the improvement of government  capacity to project the development of economic sectors, along  with capacity to develop, assess and implement effective P&Ms. He  also underlined the need for models to forecast emissions from  transport and agricultural activities.

### DISCUSSION ON WORKING PAPER 1

Participants addressed the  questions raised in Working Paper 1 on general and cross-cutting  issues by addressing each one separately. Chair Ziesing requested  participants to identify any additional issues requiring  discussion. Saudi Arabia suggested addressing the modeling of  impacts of response measures and the spill-over effect of Annex I  mitigation on developing countries.

Chair Ziesing pointed to questions raised in Working Paper 1 on  methodological issues regarding recommendations on different  scenarios. He requested participants' views on whether all Parties  should prepare scenarios 'without measures,' 'with measures' and  'with additional measures.' The US noted problems with defining  climate policies, and whether these include other non-climate  environmental policies that also reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  She observed that reporting 'with additional measures' was  politically sensitive.

The EC encouraged the calculation of 'with additional measures'  scenarios and noted the difficulty of preparing 'without measures'  scenarios. Germanwatch said 'with additional measures' scenarios  may be necessary for Parties to develop in order to identify how  to meet their emissions reduction targets. Chair Ziesing suggested  that comparing 'with measures' and 'with additional measures'  scenarios would indicate how Parties could meet their reduction  targets. Argentina questioned the meaning of 'without measures'  scenarios, and suggested that if 'with measures' scenarios are  business as usual, then 'with additional measures' represents a  mitigation scenario. The RSPB pointed to situations where  non-climate policy measures have secondary effects of reducing  emissions. Ireland suggested that non-environmental policies  should also be included, pointing to agricultural policies that  also reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an example. The EC  stressed the importance of considering both climate change  policies and other policies that reduce emissions, in order to see  what further measures could be taken to reach the emissions  reduction targets. Denmark highlighted the distinction between  policies and measures, suggesting that only implemented measures  should be considered in scenarios. The EC suggested that  simultaneous employment of the terms 'reference scenario' and  'business as usual' and 'with measures' was confusing. Chair  Ziesing concluded that clear definitions for the different  scenario-types are important.

Parties then addressed the incorporation of technological progress  into projection modeling and the question of how macroeconomic  costs and macroeconomic impacts of climate-related measures have  been modeled. On the latter, Germany said that this would depend  on the definitions of different scenarios, while Argentina said  that different scenarios are not comparable and therefore the  costs and impacts are not comparable. China said that the  introduction of cost considerations would further complicate the  models and questioned how this could contribute to the UNFCCC  process. Citing a study using different models including costs  with various results proving difficult to interpret, the US  preferred not to report macroeconomic costs as part of emissions  projections.

Participants discussed whether any particular techniques could be  used to integrate cross-country influences and international  market developments into national projections. They agreed that  this was of greater relevance to some countries than others. Chair  Ziesing highlighted the impact of national measures on other  countries, based on an earlier intervention from Saudi Arabia.

On methods to assess uncertainty in greenhouse gas projections and  improve uncertainty analysis, the EC suggested the development of  a list of factors that could enhance uncertainty assessment.  Noting that it would be difficult to identify a definite list of  parameters, Chair Ziesing suggested that presenting a range of low  and high scenarios could improve uncertainty analysis.

On the applicability and comparative advantages of various types  of models, Chair Ziesing noted agreement among participants that  it is not possible to have a common model, but called for maximum  transparency in modeling. Ireland underlined that, while models  showing different results are a cause for concern, models that  show the same result are not necessarily compatible. Agreeing with  Ireland, the Czech Republic pointed out that countries have  invested considerable time and effort in developing different  models, and should not be asked to change them.

On possible means to facilitate the comparability of national  greenhouse gas projections, Germany proposed to recommend a small  and robust set of general key assumptions such as world energy  prices, population and GDP. Belgium said that GDP was a result of  other considerations in his country's model, while the EC noted  that it did not matter whether GDP was an input or output of the  model as long as its origin was clear. China suggested providing  more detail, such as information on key assumptions by sector.

On consistent definitions of projection scenarios, participants  agreed that workshop recommendations should include providing  'with measures' scenarios, as done in most national  communications, and requesting the UNFCCC Secretariat to prepare  general tables to address present greenhouse gas projections in  the national communications.

Regarding consistency with previous greenhouse gas inventories,  Chair Ziesing noted that updates in data make it difficult to  compare inventories. Austria commented on the convenience of using  older finalized data instead of the latest inventory 'unfinished'  data. The US said that although her country makes yearly  methodological and data updates, explaining the resulting  inconsistencies to the reviewers does not present a problem.

Participants then addressed questions regarding the availability  of information on modeling approaches and key assumptions. The EC  said national communications can allow for key assumptions to be  outlined, but space limitations mean that assumptions cannot be  fully explained. China suggested the publication of a book  explaining the projections, in order to provide background on the  modeling approaches and key assumptions.

Saudi Arabia highlighted outstanding issues to be addressed,  including implementation of win-win P&Ms, assessing socioeconomic  impacts of P&Ms on developing countries, assessing impacts of P&Ms  already implemented, and assessing the spill-over effect of Annex  I response measures on developing countries. He stressed that  activities related to responses measures, as included in decision  5/CP.7 (implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 on adverse  effects), should be included in the UNFCCC reporting guidelines  for Annex I Parties.

Chair Ziesing and Sergey Kononov recalled that the workshop  mandate does not include a discussion on the reporting guidelines.  Saudi Arabia pointed to his country's views as outlined in the  workshop submission. Chair Ziesing suggested that another body  might address this issue.

# SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATING TO ENERGY, INDUSTRY AND WASTE

This session, chaired by Neil Ferry, addressed energy sector  projections, including emissions from stationary combustion and  transport, industry and waste management.

### PRESENTATIONS ON NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

Francis Altdorfer,  ECONOTEC, Belgium, presented an energy demand model using the  Emissions Projection Model (EPM), developed by ECONOTEC and used  for Belgium's third national communication. He said energy demand  modeling plays a crucial role in Belgium, given limited  flexibility in reducing emissions from energy, the complex  relationship between economic activity and emissions levels, and  the substantial emissions reduction potential with negative cost.  These factors require a simulation model that uses a bottom-up  disaggregated approach.

Altdorfer said EPM is used to model business as usual scenarios,  technical and economic potential, and emissions reduction cost  curves, while taking into account, inter alia, mitigation measures  specific to particular sources and the distribution of costs.  Among the challenges, he listed links between bottom-up and  macroeconomic modeling, and projecting emissions of fluorinated  gases. During the ensuing discussion, China questioned the driving  forces in the service sector that are taken into account, and  Altdorfer agreed that this presented a challenge given the variety  of activities, and requires further work.

Kejun Jiang, Energy Research Institute, China, presented on the  Integrated Policy Assessment Model for China (IPAC), which  includes, inter alia, models for technology, emissions, power  generation and transport. He said common scenarios and parameters  are used in the different models to ensure consistency in results.  Describing several industrial and transport parameters for China,  he said China's economic target for 2020, which is to quadruple  the GDP, is a key driving force. He noted that future challenges  include better understanding of the energy production and  consumption sectors in China.

Jir√≠ Spitz, ENVIROS, Czech Republic, spoke on methods and models  used to project emissions from the energy, transport, industry and  waste management sectors in his country. He noted that the energy  and industry sectors contribute the greatest portion of greenhouse  gas emissions in the Czech Republic and described a linear  optimizing and technology-oriented model for projecting emissions.  Energy Flow Optimization Model-Environment (EFOM-ENV). He noted  that energy demand is calculated by sector and type of energy  using a spreadsheet model. Spitz said that mitigation measures are  reflected in the model, apart from those in the programmes of the  Czech Energy Agency and the State Environmental Fund. He said that  realized and planned joint implementation (JI) projects have been  taken into account.

Dalia ¬ätreimikiene, Lithuanian Energy Institute, presented the  Lithuanian experience in preparing greenhouse gas projections. She  explained the lack of 'with measures' scenarios in the second  national communication, noting that 'high' and 'low' development  scenarios had been presented instead. She emphasized the role of  the National Energy Strategy in providing information on  mitigation measures for use in scenarios. She said uncertainties  in energy projections are related to uncertainties in assumptions,  for instance in GDP growth rate and energy efficiency  improvements. ¬ätreimikiene said Lithuania has projections for all  sectors, and noted that total projections indicate that her  country will not have difficulties in meeting the Kyoto emissions  reduction target.

In describing the development of 'with measures' scenarios, she  noted that P&Ms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are driven by  the requirements for EU integration. ¬ätreimikiene said climate  change mitigation is the secondary benefit of the P&Ms, but these  are nevertheless included in the 'with measures' projections  because all P&Ms affect greenhouse gas emissions. She said that  additional measures include greenhouse gas emissions trading, the  EU taxation framework for energy products and JI.

Janis Rekis, Latvian Investment and Development Agency, presented  on experiences with greenhouse gas emissions projections for the  energy sector in Latvia. He said the process started in 1995,  using the MARKAL model (Market Allocations systems engineering  model for waste management), employing a bottom-up approach. He  presented an overview of the model, and suggested that generic  tables for reporting assumptions and results would be useful.  Among challenges, he included emission factors for new fuels, lack  of an established national system and lack of capacity.

Ton Van Dril, Energy Research Center of the Netherlands (ECN),  described the ECN model. He said a bottom-up approach is necessary  to project developments in energy consumption in specific sectors.   He emphasized the differences between economic and physical growth  paths, saying it is important to look at policies that affect the  physical-economic linkages. On energy growth paths, he said both  energy efficiency and energy development measures should be  considered, since not all development measures are energy  efficient. Elaborating on methods to account for ways in which  technology penetrates society, he said technologies are not always  mature, and are not well known. In addition to these factors, he  noted key policy factors that have to be considered while making  projections, such as awareness creation, technical and legal  possibilities, and incentives, including financial incentives  or sanctions.

Among the weaknesses of the bottom-up approach, Van Dril listed  the unpredictability of certain trends, limited data sets, data  requirements and validation, and awareness and information costs.  In the discussion, participants addressed possible institutional  arrangements for providing consistent data for use in models, and  acknowledged possible problems, such as different exchange rates  and different timing for preparing projections in different  countries.

Adding to his previous presentation, Stane Mer¬öe spoke on modeling  approaches applied for the industrial and transport sector in  Slovenia. He discussed the inclusion of factors such as best  available technologies, on-site energy improvements, fuel  switching, and penetration of measures driven by legislation.

Nilg√ºn Egemen, State Institute of Statistics, Turkey, described  the projection exercise carried out for the first national  communication to be completed later this year. She outlined  present and projected energy scenarios for Turkey, noting that the  energy sector is the biggest producer of carbon dioxide emissions  in Turkey. She said Turkey's Energy and Environment Review has  projected emissions and energy demand until 2025, taking into  account various factors such new technologies, the potential for  co-generation, and assessments of reduction of transmission and  distribution loss. Egemen described assumptions used in  alternative scenarios, the results of which demonstrate the  importance of, among other things, demand-side management,  cogeneration in the industrial sector and improved technological  efficiency in the power sector. Emissions projections were also  carried out on local pollution scenarios.

Katherine Casey Delhotal, US Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA), presented the US approach for projected greenhouse gas  emissions. She said the National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) of  the Energy Information Administration is used for projecting  carbon dioxide emissions based on P&Ms in place as of 1 July 2001,  while the EPA has carried out non-carbon dioxide emissions  projections. She said the impacts of the National Energy Policy  and the Global Climate Change Initiative, which promotes a  voluntary approach, were not included in the projections. On  uncertainties, she said the EPA does include technologies that are  in demonstration, and uncertainties could be caused by, inter  alia, regulatory and statutory changes that are difficult to  model, energy price changes, and the weather.

Replying to a question from Belgium on why a simple method is used  to model HFCs, PFCs and sulphur hexafluoride emissions instead of  the model used in the projections for ozone depleting substances,  Delhotal said the sources are not necessarily similar and that  there were difficulties in data collection, as companies are  hesitant to divulge proprietary information. In response to a  question from China on whether scenarios 'with additional  measures' will be projected in the future, she said it is unlikely  that they will be considered for the fourth national  communication, even if there is a change in administration as a  result of the Presidential election later this year, since the  time would be too brief.

### DISCUSSION ON WORKING PAPER 2

Participants discussed questions  raised in Working Paper 2 one by one, beginning by exchanging  views on modeling energy demand and discussing approaches for  projecting changes in the energy supply mix.

The US said that the primary purpose of most energy demand models  in her country is to inform energy policy, rather than calculate  carbon dioxide emissions projections, making it difficult to  provide recommendations on best practices for modeling energy  demand. Sergey Kononov raised the issue of overestimates in  projections. Germany suggested providing 'low' and 'high'  projections to address this. Bulgaria observed that  overestimations may result from the fact that national  communications are a communication by governments to the UNFCCC,  not a scientific exercise. The Netherlands noted that despite  political requirements, expert choices are made with respect to  the model results. He suggested considering consistency of  assumptions, rather than consistency in models. The RSPB pointed  to two sources of uncertainty: in the assumptions entered into  models and in the models themselves. The EC said one  recommendation could be to create a 'pool' of available models to  be shared among experts who are fearful of employing these due to  lack of experience. China suggested that a common approach could  be to have bottom-up models.

Participants then addressed liberalization of energy markets, and  whether particular modeling techniques are necessary to reflect  this in projections. They deliberated whether and how  liberalization is included in models used for the existing  national communications, and how to reflect this in neighboring  countries with connected economies.

On modeling greenhouse gas mitigation measures particularly  relevant to the energy sector, participants highlighted  difficulties in defining the baseline for projections. Saudi  Arabia suggested recommending efforts to avoid impacts of  mitigation measures in Annex I Parties on non-Annex I Parties.  Germany pointed out that national models could not account for  impacts on other countries, for which bi-national or multinational  models are required. Chair Ferry noted that the present workshop  did not have a mandate to address the issue, but it would be noted.

On implications of emissions trading and project-based mechanisms  on projections, the Netherlands said assumptions about the EU  Emissions Trading Scheme and project-based mechanisms are  considered in his country's emissions projections. China suggested  that countries with experience in including trading mechanisms in  projections could report on their experiences for the benefit of  other countries. Bulgaria said accounting for trading in  projections was a problem for EIT countries, given the lack of  information on the willingness of countries to engage in JI  projects, and the resulting impact on emissions in EIT countries.

On projections of bunker fuel emissions, the RSPB said that, in  some cases, the rise in aviation-related emissions negates the  effect of mitigation measures, but countries still do not account  for bunker fuel emissions in projections. Saudi Arabia said it was  premature to talk about bunker fuel emissions, since no decision  had been reached in the negotiations. He called for the inclusion  of the impacts of response measures on non-Annex I Parties in the  recommendations for modeling transport-related taxation.

Regarding the industry sector, the International Chamber of  Commerce said modeling difficulties in calculating and presenting  HFCs, PFCs and sulphur hexafluoride emissions are related to the  high rate of change in the sector, driven by many concerns,  including environmental and macroeconomic concerns.

Saudi Arabia said that it is the use of energy, not supply, that  drives emissions.

Bulgaria said supply refers to the mining, delivery, and production  of energy.

Chair Ferry said in the case of electricity, it is the supply, not  the use, that is the problem. The issue was noted.

# SPECIFIC ISSUES RELATING TO AGRICULTURE AND LULUCF

This session was chaired by Micheal Young. Jenny Wong, UNFCCC  Secretariat, gave an overview of Working Paper 3 on issues in the  preparation of greenhouse gas projections for agriculture and  LULUCF. She noted, inter alia, that the reporting of projections  from LULUCF had been scarce, and that some national communications  provide little or no information on the main drivers behind  projected emissions from agriculture and LULUCF, thereby reducing  the transparency and credibility of projections from this sector.  Participants heard presentations and then discussed the Working  Paper.

### PRESENTATIONS ON NATIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES

Trevor Donnellan, Rural  Economy Research Center, Ireland, presented on greenhouse gas  emissions projections from agriculture in his country. He  described the models used and emphasized the importance of inputs  by national experts and interlinkages within agricultural sectors.  He observed that policy models that can form the basis for  emissions projections do exist and that agricultural policy alone  can have important effects on emissions projections. He also  stressed the importance of sensitivity analyses as agricultural  prices in the EU move closer to world prices and therefore become  more volatile.

In reply to a question, Donellan said that projections beyond  2010-12 are uncertain. Other questions related to interlinkages  and the isolation of agriculture from the rest of the economy in  the models, which Donellan explained as having to do with the size  of the sector and its share of the GDP.

Paula Per√§l√§, MTT Agrifood Research, Finland, presented an  overview of the emissions scenarios from agriculture presented in  her country's third national communication and now in the process  of being updated. As the main challenges, she mentioned the need  to: further develop models; incorporate important animal  categories and crop species; make the models more consistent with  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines;  include them in the Finnish National System for calculating  greenhouse gas inventories; and use them to follow up the  implementation of the National Climate Strategy.

Leonard Brown, Climate Change Office, New Zealand, described his  country's emissions projections, highlighting the importance of  institutional arrangements and links between personnel responsible  for inventories and for projections. He described the main drivers  of emissions projections from agriculture: animal population by  species; productivity and emissions per animal; forecasts for  nitrogen fertilizer usage; and P&Ms such as environmental  constraints and price measures. He also noted that New Zealand's  projections are made only until 2010, after which there are too  many uncertainties. Regarding forestry, he said the models are now  being reworked and mentioned the need to refine data.

Questions were raised regarding the effects of carrying capacity,  the displacement of sheep farms by dairy farms, accounting for  afforestation, reforestation and deforestation under the Protocol  Article 3.3, and on the difficulty of calculating forestry growth  rates and establishing scenarios.

Steen Gyldenk√¶rne, National Environmental Research Institute,  Denmark, presented on Danish emissions projections from  agriculture. He gave an overview of the agricultural sector in his  country, noting that deforestation is banned and agriculture is  highly regulated as a result of nitrogen leeching. He described a  module containing an interlinked agricultural inventory as the  basis for projections and the use of equilibrium models for  calculating future activity. As lessons learned, he mentioned the  importance of expert analysis and the need to consider long-term  market development.

In the discussion, participants addressed the use of the Monte  Carlo model for addressing uncertainties, nitrogen estimates and  assumptions about the use of fertilizer, and IPCC default emission  factors.

### DISCUSSION ON WORKING PAPER 3

Participants discussed the  questions raised in Working Paper 3, beginning by addressing key  methodological issues for agriculture. Regarding the definition  and projection of activity levels and emission factors,  participants deliberated approaches for projecting emission  factors and the possibility of identifying best practices for such  estimates. Participants discussed how sector sensitivity might  vary over time. Italy noted the inverse relationship between  ammonia production from manure management and methane and nitrous  oxide emissions. He suggested a relationship between the UNFCCC  and the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution to  address this. Participants discussed how to reflect ammonia  production in projections, with the EC observing that this data  may already be included in information on P&Ms, and thereby  included in models.

Participants also deliberated whether emission factors should be  kept constant or extrapolated for the purpose of projections,  agreeing that where additional information is available, emission  factors should not be held constant. They also agreed that where  Parties have specific emission factors, these should be applied.

Participants noted that longer-term agriculture models should be  encouraged.

They then addressed the use of specialized agriculture models in  projections, discussing briefly the New Zealand OVERSEER Nutrient  Budget model for estimating nitrous oxide emissions from soil.  Participants agreed that recommendations on specialized models are  not desirable at this point.

On modeling greenhouse gas-related factors particularly relevant  to agriculture, Finland raised the problem of lack of data  availability, and suggested improving methodologies for gathering  information. Noting that it is more a matter of good organization  than lack of data, the Netherlands said detailed statistics,  updated every five years, could significantly improve the quality  of inventories. The EC pointed to bottom-up approaches for  assessing P&Ms, and the Netherlands suggested merging both  bottom-up and top-down approaches. Italy proposed improved  cooperation between national institutions, possibly through expert  groups, to allow more cohesive institutional arrangements.

Participants discussed the UNFCCC guidelines' requirement to  present the main drivers of projected emissions from agricultural  activities in order to increase the transparency and credibility  of projections in the sector. The Netherlands supported the idea  of providing an explanation of the drivers, suggesting that the  experts who provide the figures could easily add a simple  clarification. Among the main factors that influence emissions,  Denmark proposed area of occupation, number of livestock,  fertilizer application and distribution of manure as general  examples. The Republic of Korea added area of rice cultivation.  New Zealand suggested referring to the IPCC common reporting  format (CRF) tables. Finland called for more information on  historical background and linking past and future trends.

Participants then turned to questions on key methodological issues  for LULUCF. Chair Young encouraged participants to discuss  specific difficulties in presenting LULUCF projections.  Participants agreed that producing LULUCF inventory information is  challenging enough, and that projections pose an additional  burden. New Zealand and Denmark suggested lack of expertise as a  challenge to projections. The Netherlands said projections can be  based on extrapolation, but this results in high uncertainty.  Finland pointed to three challenges: classification of land  according to the IPCC categories; difficulties in tracking changes  in land use; and assessing the distribution of mineral and organic  soils. Other participants observed that their countries had not  produced national projections since they await the adoption of the  IPCC LULUCF Good Practice Guidance (GPG). Participants agreed to  recommend that the GPG form the basis for assessing projections.

Turning to drivers of projected LULUCF emissions, participants  addressed whether recommendations could be provided on factors and  variables.

Regarding how drivers could best be used to clarify the projected  behavior of greenhouse gas emissions and removals from LULUCF,  Chair Young suggested that the problem is related to reporting  rather than methodologies. Jenny Wong noted that the workshop on  fourth national communications, scheduled for 30 September to 1  October 2004, will address the issue from a reporting perspective.

Participants discussed approaches, methods and sources of  information and data, commenting that methods used by Parties to  report emissions and removals vary, are usually not comparable,  and diverge from those used in national inventories. They  exchanged views on the relevance of extrapolating emissions and  removals and providing alternative approaches. New Zealand noted  there are models available that could be used. Finland suggested  that agriculture and LULUCF reporting should be more closely  linked. Wong noted that in the forthcoming 2006 IPCC guidelines,  agriculture will be included with LULUCF.

# WRAP-UP DISCUSSION

Facilitators of the groups presented summaries of discussions and  recommendations at the conclusion of the workshop.

### GENERAL AND CROSS-CUTTING ISSUES

Hans-Joachim Ziesing summarized  conclusions and recommendations on cross-cutting and general  issues. Referring to the eleven presentations on national  circumstances and the related discussions, he noted the value of  exchanging experiences. On consistent definitions of projection  scenarios, he reported on the recommendation to provide a 'with  measures' scenario that should be in accordance with the UNFCCC  reporting guidelines' definitions. He stressed the importance of  having a common understanding of 'with measures' projections. He  noted several recommendations regarding the preparation of  scenarios: that the 'with measures' scenario should include all  P&Ms currently in place, whether or not the primary objective is  greenhouse gas mitigation; and that Annex I Parties who wish to  provide 'without measures' and/or 'with additional measures'  projections should ensure that mitigation P&Ms that are included  are clearly identified and that information on how they are  modeled is transparent and sufficient.

Ziesing stressed the conclusion that transparency of information  is necessary in all aspects of projections. To this end, he said  that sectoral and gas-by-gas data should be provided. He noted  that the Secretariat had been requested to suggest a template for  providing this information, and would present a draft after his  presentation.

On consistency with the latest available greenhouse gas inventory,  he noted that time-scale presents challenges to assuring such  consistency. He said the issue appears less important since no  significant inconsistencies are expected, and noted the  recommendation that the finalized version of the inventory be used.

Regarding the availability of information on modeling approaches  and key assumptions, Ziesing pointed to the discussion on  transparency in the presentation of models and projections, which  recommended that information on methodologies, models and key  assumptions for projections should be provided.

On incorporation of technological progress, he said this is  usually done by using exogenous assumptions about changes in model  parameters resulting from technological progress. To this end, he  noted that methods that represent technological progress  endogenously require further research.

On integration of cross-country factors, impacts on other  countries, and international market developments into national  projections, he said it is not currently possible to assess  whether and to what extent such factors are taken into  consideration in the preparation of projections. He said that  participants recommended that Annex I Parties identify areas of  their economy that are potentially affected by such factors and  explore what effects the factors will have on greenhouse gas  projections.

Regarding methods for assessing the uncertainty in projected  emissions, he pointed to sensitivity analysis as the preferred  method. He highlighted participants' emphasis on the value of  uncertainty analysis and the recommendation that such analysis be  an element of greenhouse gas projections. He noted the advantage  of using a common set of defined parameters for sensitivity  analysis.

On the applicability and comparative advantages of various types  of models, Ziesing noted participants' views on the impossibility  of indicating the usefulness of individual models for particular  aspects of projection modeling due to differing circumstances  among countries. To this end, participants felt that use of a  single model or a single approach is neither feasible nor useful.

Noting the discussion on possible means to facilitate the  comparability of national projections, Ziesing said the  availability of information on certain key assumptions could be  helpful. He reflected participants' views that using the same data  for some parameters, including oil prices on the international  market or global macroeconomic trends, may be difficult to  implement. On projections of macroeconomic costs and impacts of  climate-related measures, Ziesing noted that the UNFCCC guidelines  do not require information on such projections, which represent a  complex task since results require significant analysis and  interpretation. A recommendation is that Annex I Parties wishing  to provide such information should also explain the process for  estimating the costs and impacts.

Ziesing said that some general and cross-cutting issues had been  raised, but not discussed, including methodologies to assess  impacts of P&Ms on non-Annex I Parties, noted by Saudi Arabia. He  welcomed participants to provide details on Internet addresses for  projections, models and methods used in their countries, in order  to continue to share knowledge and experiences.

Stelios Pesmajoglou then presented an outline of the template for  presenting information on projections, suggesting that projections  for all gases be reported for each sector according to the  inventory disaggregation of sectors, including emissions in  original units and in carbon dioxide-equivalent units. He said the  table would be completed for each scenario and projection year.  The EC suggested including a list of global warming potentials,  thereby eliminating the need to report emissions in original  units. Pesmajoglou said reporting on projections is required to be  consistent with reporting of P&Ms. Germanwatch suggested  requesting Parties to report on international bunker fuel  emissions projections as well.

### ENERGY, TRANSPORT, INDUSTRY AND WASTE MANAGEMENT

Recommendations  and conclusions from discussions on energy, transport, industry  and waste management projections were presented by group  facilitator Neil Ferry. He said a key outcome is the value of what  participants take away from the workshop, and noted that best  practices for projections differ from those for inventories.

Summarizing recommendations, he said transparent and clear  presentation of assumptions and critical data is as important as  the modeling process itself, and it is useful to vary key  assumptions and identify sensitivity of projected emissions. He  noted the varied views on whether GDP was a variable in itself.

Ferry observed that the choice of models and assumptions was  ultimately a matter for governments, but there is a value in  deciding 'common international assumptions,' such as oil prices  and carbon prices. Issues such as who should provide this data and  its timeliness are still to be considered.

On stationary combustion, Ferry pointed to the recommendation that  there is value in consulting with neighbors and discussing 'robust  and available' models. In the latter case, he reported that there  are some concerns about the cost of the models themselves, and of  using and adapting them.

On modeling P&Ms, Ferry noted that both endogenous and exogenous  approaches are used, and many countries focus on 'with measures'  and 'without additional measures' scenarios for policy choices.  Participants agreed on the usefulness of key source and/or driver  analysis.

On the inclusion of international emissions trading in  projections, he said that participants agreed that trading does  not change domestic emissions, but should form part of the  analysis of policy choices. He also noted Saudi Arabia's point on  the need to model effects of P&Ms on non-Annex I Parties.

Ferry reported that the group agreed that emissions from transport  should be reported separately from emissions from the rest of the  energy sector, and it was important to model individual transport  modes and the selection among modes. On bunker fuels, he reflected  the view of participants that it is important to consider these in  order to present a complete energy balance, and that there are no  methodological problems in modeling projections. He noted the  suggestion by Saudi Arabia to consider the impact of emission  taxes on non-Annex I Parties.

On the industry and waste management sector, he said participants  agreed on the importance of data on activity levels and emission  factors, and on presenting results and assumptions clearly. The  recommendations include the need for a 'reality check' on  projections for fluorinated gases to reflect rapid changes in the  industry.

### AGRICULTURE AND LULUCF

Micheal Young reported on the discussion  of the working group on emissions projections from agriculture and  LULUCF and highlighted conclusions and recommendations, noting  that expertise in the group had been predominantly in agriculture.  He began by summarizing discussions on agriculture.

On projections for activity levels and emission factors, Young  said that participants agreed to consider possible future changes  in emission factors, since these may change as productivity levels  change. They also agreed on the significance of providing  information on P&Ms to abate ammonia emissions given the synergies  between ammonia and nitrous oxide. He said that participants had  stressed the emerging importance of sensitivity analysis as the  agriculture sector becomes more globalized, involving increased  volatility of international exchange rates, which should be  factored into the analysis. Regarding the timeframe of  projections, he noted that projections are less viable beyond ten  years.

On the use of specialized models, he said that, when possible,  data and models used in inventories should also be used in  projections, and that the focus should be on good scientific  practice rather than on models. Accordingly, he said the group did  not recommend use of any specialized models, but agreed that a  multi-model approach is desirable.

On modeling the impact of greenhouse gas-related factors, Young  noted that this data is often not easily factored into a top-down  approach, and bottom-up approaches could be used to include P&Ms  in the projection models. He observed that the indirect effects of  P&Ms are difficult to gauge and noted the usefulness of iteration  between models to refine projections.

He said that participants agreed on the importance of presenting  the main drivers for emissions projections, since these are not  only related to projections but also to the inventory. Young  outlined additional recommendations, namely to include a list of  emission drivers with reference to the CRF tables, and for Parties  to provide a textual interpretation of drivers and context be  provided in the national communications.

Young then turned to conclusions and recommendations on LULUCF.  Regarding specific difficulties associated with emissions  projections for LULUCF, Young said participants noted that  forestry projections are available and common in the forestry  industry, in contrast to other areas of LULUCF. He said that where  inventories are good, projections are not an issue, given that  changes in carbon stocks are very low, and therefore investment in  specialized models might not be worthwhile. However, he said that  participants noted the challenges in tracking changes in land use  and in carbon stocks from land-use change, and emphasized that  activity data needs to be improved.

On the main drivers behind LULUCF projections, participants agreed  on the convenience of deriving a list of variables such as growth  rates, tree density and biomass expansion factors, to better guide  projections.

In addressing exchange of information on available methods and  models, Young noted the need to consider the linkage between  agriculture and forestry, and said existing data sets on forest  inventories, maps and remote sensing allow for simple  extrapolations. He stressed the views of participants on the need  for expert opinion in projection models, and said the application  of the GPG will improve inventories, and hence projections. The  group was unable to further elaborate on LULUCF projections and  provide solutions.

Young reported that participants also discussed institutional  arrangements, stressing cooperation between institutions to  overcome methodological issues and problems, estimate the effects  of P&Ms, and contribute to building projection estimates.

# CLOSING REMARKS

Halld√≥r Thorgeirsson thanked participants and facilitators, noting  that the report of the workshop will be presented to SBSTA-21  under its own agenda item. He observed that SBSTA is not expected  to take much action on the report, since the exchange of  information and experiences among participants represents the most  significant benefit of the workshop. He recalled that the outcomes  of the workshop will feed into the workshop on fourth national  communications in Dublin, Ireland, scheduled for 30 September to 1  October 2004. On behalf of SBSTA Chair Benrageb, he then closed  the workshop at 11:12 am.
