# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

On financial and technical support and GEF action on non-Annex I  communications, the Secretariat stated that eight initial  communications have been received, 23 are expected in 1998 and  30 in 1999. The deadline was March 1998. The EU and others  called for a COP-4 decision on in-country expert reviews. The G-77/CHINA highlighted financial and technical constraints and  capacity building for adaptation. SRI LANKA stressed all-region  adaptation training. THAILAND noted difficulties with the  adaptation assessment model. GEORGIA and AZERBAIJAN stressed  continuing GEF support. Assistance was requested for: finance  and know-how (MOROCCO); technical needs (BURKINA FASO); longer- term implementation (the CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC, ARGENTINA);  vulnerability (ARGENTINA); emission mitigation in other sectors  and formulation of implementation programs (URUGUAY, ARGENTINA);  and second national communications (SENEGAL, MEXICO).

The G-77/CHINA reminded UNEP and UNDP that they are implementing  agencies of the operating entity of the financial mechanism.  NIGERIA suggested GEF sub-regional offices for project  monitoring. BURKINA FASO, THAILAND, and AZERBAIJAN called for  translations of guidelines. SENEGAL, with ARGENTINA, noted  constraints on translation and dissemination of communications.  The EU and AUSTRALIA stressed accelerating submission of initial  communications, assisted by GEF. UZBEKISTAN stressed information  exchange for Central Asia. BENIN requested facilitation of  conference attendance from Africa.

On the financial mechanism, the Chair noted review of the FCCC's  financial mechanism must be completed with a COP-4 decision. On  guidance to the GEF, the Chair noted new needs since 1996  guidance was provided. The G77/CHINA called for: GEF adherence  to COP guidance; no funding of activities inconsistent with FCCC  principles; and, with EGYPT, attention to adaptation measures.  EGYPT called for long-term sustainability. CHINA called for: a  more streamlined project approval process; transparency in  incremental cost calculation, and, with IRAN, no  conditionalities attached to the activities of multilateral  funding institutions, which was opposed by CANADA.

The EU distinguished GEF review from future guidance; and, with  SWITZERLAND, CANADA and VENEZUELA, proposed making it the  permanent FCCC financing mechanism, subject to future reviews.  SWITZERLAND stressed adequacy and predictability in the flow of  funds. With AUSTRALIA, he noted a draft decision. SAUDI ARABIA  cautioned against a premature conclusion. CANADA supported CDM  support for adaptation activities. JAPAN said it contributes 20%  of GEF funding and called for extensive evaluation. IRAN  criticized a GEF overemphasis on energies. The Chair asked Dan  Reifsnyder (US) and John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) to chair a  contact group to prepare a draft decision.

On implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects and  impacts of responses), the Chair explained that consideration of  Decision 3/CP.3 and the related Protocol Articles 2.3 and 3.14  had been added to the agenda item, as per a COP-3 request. The  Secretariat introduced documentation (FCCC/SBI/1998/CRP.1),  offering an analytical framework to facilitate a response that  is compatible with the Protocol. BURKINA FASO called for an ad  hoc committee, supported by the Secretariat, to assess Annex I  Party efforts and report to the COP.

The G-77/CHINA, supported by the MARSHALL ISLANDS, suggested a  role for SBSTA and the possible need for an expert meeting  before COP-4. The MARSHALL ISLANDS also called for regional  workshops on adaptation. SAUDI ARABIA proposed, inter alia,  that: the Secretariat's analytical framework combine  consideration of adverse effects and impacts; SBI form a  permanent committee on implementation of Articles 4.8 and 4.9;  COP-4 request information from Annex I Parties on policies and  measures, fossil fuel imports during the first commitment period  and estimated effects on other imports from developing  countries; and processes not discriminate against any country  clusters identified in Articles 4.8 and 4.9.

AOSIS stressed the urgency of the question of insurance and,  with the MARSHALL ISLANDS, viewed the additions to the agenda  item as technical rather than substantive. The EU favored CDM  support for adaptation, but stressed a focus on mitigation. He  noted that action on Article 4.8 must await more certainty on  effects on fossil fuel use, calling for further input and  discussion. VENEZUELA opposed limiting action to studies and  called for a COP-4 decision. The US asked for more time for  comment. SAUDI ARABIA opposed delaying formation of a contact  group on this.

The Chair introduced discussion on involvement of NGOs and  called for consensus at SBI-8. The US, opposed by the EU, called  for including labor, agriculture, and quasi-governmental  entities. SWITZERLAND extended this to all Agenda 21 major  groups. The US, SWITZERLAND and CANADA opposed current exclusion  of NGOs from the contact group on flexibility mechanisms.  General support was expressed for Chair discretion on NGO access  to informal meetings. The CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK asked for a  proposal for additional participation and transparency in  registration. An industry representative called for greater  access to informal meetings with the Chair.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVICE

On methodological issues, the US and EU stressed keeping the  guidelines under review and incorporating additional  methodological issues raised by the Kyoto Protocol. Supported by  POLAND, HUNGARY underscored the need to enhance understanding of  the three new gases under the Kyoto Protocol. POLAND said that  there is a need to conduct further work on emission factors  since these differ for different sectors, between and within  countries. He called for guidelines for the preparation of  default projections. The Chair proposed a workshop on national  communications and another with the aim of addressing the  problems identified by SBSTA.

Some countries, including JAPAN and the US, noted the urgent  need for a decision on which anthropogenic activities should be  included because it influences the ability of some countries to  ratify and implement the Protocol. The EU reaffirmed that  inclusion of sink activities should not undermine incentives for  action on gross emission mitigation. AUSTRALIA and the US  suggested prioritization of issues. MAURITANIA, with ICELAND,  cautioned against concentrating solely on forests and  conservation. AOSIS expressed concern over 'blanket' inclusion  in sinks of all land use and forestry activities as this would  introduce uncertainties and distract the Protocol from focusing  on fossil fuel dependence. COLOMBIA stressed that technical  aspects of Article 3.3, such as establishing what is meant by  net change in stock, must be resolved. Addressing Article 3.4  depends on the will of some Parties. NORWAY and CANADA sought to  establish a process to enable COP-5 to consider sinks.

Several delegations said SBSTA should call on IPCC to address  outstanding technical questions in a special report. The EU  called for work on methodologies for quantifying changes in soil  carbon as a result of forest activities since 1990, and on  whether the current revised 1996 IPCC guidelines allow for  transparent reporting and verfication. With AOSIS, JAPAN, the US  and AUSTRALIA, he sought clarification of the IPCC terms and  definitions of afforestation, reforestation and deforestation.  ICELAND said improvements to degraded land should be included in  the list of human-induced activities. With the US, he said IPCC  should evaluate the consequences of limiting activities that can  be included. The US also highlighted, inter alia: effects of  cropland and rangelands; improvements in forest management; and  inventory and data reporting.

SOUTH AFRICA, supported by BURKINA FASO, said SBSTA should task  the IPCC to examine, inter alia, methods for distinguishing  natural and anthropogenic sinks, the role of carbon stocks and  wood products, definitions of eligible land uses and the role of  sinks in biodiversity protection.

CANADA said the capacity of agricultural soils presents a global  opportunity for promoting sustainable farming and said soil sink  projects should be included under the CDM. The US cautioned  against delays in the CDM process and said sink-related activity  must move forward in the project-based process. Some  delegations, including CANADA, JAPAN and the US supported  continuing discussions informally. The EU, NORWAY, DENMARK,  COLOMBIA and ENVIRONMENTAL NGOs stressed links to other  conventions, including those on biodiversity and  desertification. Paul Maclons (South Africa) and Maciej Sadowski  (Poland) will chair a contact group on the request to IPCC.

ICELAND, supported by AUSTRALIA, expressed concern over the  difficulties posed to small countries arising from the setting  of quantified limits on single project emissions and called for  the adoption of a threshold value for significant proportional  impact and separate reporting of process emissions. AOSIS  expressed concern that a poor message will be sent if exemptions  are listed when the Protocol is adopted. The US said additional  accommodations must be cautiously approached. The EU recalled  that differences are already addressed by differences in  quantified emission reductions and was reluctant to give  exceptions for single projects. SWITZERLAND said a separate  methodological process would threaten credibility. The Chair  asked Iceland to provide more information to the Parties.

On technology transfer, the G77/CHINA explained that the poor  responses to the surveys to establish needs can be attributed to  the absence of specific frameworks for the implementation of the  Convention. AUSTRALIA called for the identification of synergies  in technology transfer work under other Conventions. Together  with the US, he noted that national communications of non-Annex  I countries would be helpful in identifying technology needs and  underscored the role of the private sector in furthering this  sector. The EU expressed hope that the flexibility mechanisms  proposed under the Kyoto Protocol would facilitate the transfer  of technology.

CANADA said expertise in responding to questions already exists  in the private sector and research centers. URUGUAY noted the  need to transfer concrete emission reduction projects, not just  surveys and reports. He recommended a financial mechanism for  technology transfer. CHINA said the issue of technology transfer  had been marginalized and noted that it is different from  information centers. COP-4 should address this as a separate  agenda item. CHILE saw much potential for technology transfers  through the CDM.

On the issue of technology information centres, delegates called  for: the identification and assessment of means to improve the  flow of information and technology; the establishment of  regional centres, greater engagement of the private sector;  consideration of needs and participation of beneficiaries; and  the need to develop, strengthen and use existing institutions.

On technology work programmes, comments addressed: improved  government coordination; identification of barriers to transfer;  incentives for transfers by the private sector; and a September  deadline for submissions on the work programme. A contact group  will consider technology transfer.

# SPECIAL EVENT

In a special event, the World Bank stressed that the Prototype  Carbon Fund (PCF) is not a scheme for the facilitation of  emissions trading rights, but aims to demonstrate a means for  carrying out project-based emissions trades in an efficient and  equitable manner. The World Bank is not aiming to monopolize the  future trading market, nor seeking a privileged position under  the FCCC. It will not bring the PCF to the Bank's Executive  Board for approval until after COP-4.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Observers have noted that European Union Parties are again  locked in internal and prolonged debates over burden sharing, as  the implications of the Kyoto Protocol are gradually absorbed by  a number of member states. The debates are now focused on  policies and measures. Some have observed that a significant gap  exists between the European Union's top-level experts feeding  into the Union's negotiating position at the FCCC and the  capacity of home ministries' 'delivery agents' to deliver the  promised results, with all the consequences that could entail  for the post-Kyoto process.
