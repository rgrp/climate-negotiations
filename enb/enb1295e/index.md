# COP PLENARY

COP-4 President, Maria Julia Alsogaray, expressed sympathy, on  behalf of the COP, for the passing of the President of the  Comoros.

Speaking on behalf of UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Nitin  Desai, Under-Secretary for the UN Commission for Sustainable  Development, said the Kyoto Protocol offered a sustainable path  for industrialized countries and demonstrated shared stewardship  for the planet. He underscored the need for early ratification  of the Protocol and action on issues including, technology  transfer, domestic measures and scientific research. He called  for a new deadline to maintain momentum and pledged UN support.

Carlos Menem, President of Argentina, said it was an honor for  Argentina to host the COP. He said the Protocol had been  approved by the Senate of Argentina and was under consideration  in the lower house. He emphasized a clean growth strategy. At  COP-5, Argentina will make a commitment to lower emissions for  the period 2008 to 2012. Countries were to be permitted, he  said, 'to find a new way under the Convention.' The WMO (World Meteorological Organization) stated, inter alia,  that 1998 would likely surpass 1997 as the warmest year on  record and the 1997-98 El Ni√±o was the strongest in recorded  history. He emphasized attention to sinks, elaboration of the  Protocol mechanisms and adaptation issues. He called for  improved cooperation in addressing concerns common to the  Montreal and Kyoto Protocols.

UNIDO (United Nations Industrial Development Organization)  stressed that least developed countries were not to be excluded  from CDM projects in favor of countries with dynamic economies  and more emissions. On technology transfer, he emphasized the  need to enhance countries' capacity to assimilate technology.

UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) encouraged early  ratification of the Protocol to combat poverty and environmental  degradation. Noting that developing countries were responding in  meaningful ways, he highlighted the linkages between development  of poor communities, poverty eradication and climate change  initiatives.

UNEP (United Nations Environmental Programme) called for the  establishment of a Buenos Aires plan to develop coordinated  action to be enacted at COP-6. He said that UNEP supported  national programs that include enhancement of public awareness,  development and sharing of new technologies and creation of  economies of scale for renewable energy. PARLAMENTO  LATINOAMERICANO adopted a ten-point plan that included: early  signature and ratification of the Protocol; early implementation  of the CDM; and consideration of mechanisms, including a  technological transfer mechanism. It will promote debate on  climate change to influence national policies.

The WORLD BANK noted the vulnerability of developing countries  to climate change and reiterated the Bank's commitment to  promotion of sustainable development. Key initiatives include  collaboration with the GEF, funding AIJ projects, and  establishment of a funding mechanism with public and private  sector resources.

UNESCO said there was an ethical need to act promptly, stressed  the imperative for the world community to accelerate its  commitments and underscored the need to promote education,  public awareness and training programmes. GEF (Global  Environment Facility) said the replenishment of the facility  would support developing countries in working towards the  fulfillment of the FCCC and the CBD.

The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) said the  Third Assessment Report would: cover scientific technical,  economic and social issues; be policy relevant and not policy  prescriptive; and place climate change in the social context. At  the request of SBSTA, IPCC has expanded its work programme and  will face budgetary constraints. He called for increased  contributions to enable scheduled completion of work. OLADE  (Latin American Energy Organization) said its activities include  GHG estimations, energy efficiency promotion, and development of  technology for new and renewable energy.

The OECD said it aimed at enhancing cooperation with non-member  countries. Its work includes: peer review of domestic policies  and measures; establishment of international development  mechanisms; and increasing the efficacy of compliance  mechanisms.

IAE (International Energy Agency) underscored the need to engage  the energy sector in the FCCC process. He called for the  elaboration of the Kyoto mechanisms into practical working  arrangements.

SBSTA Chair Kok Kee Chow provided a report on the body's  activities. He indicated that SBSTA agreed on five draft  decisions, including: research and systematic observation  (FCCC/CP/1998/L.4); scientific and methodological aspects of the  proposal by Brazil (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/L.7); land-use change and  forestry (FCCC/CP/1998.L.5); impact of single projects on  emissions in the commitment period (FCCC/CP/1998/L.8); and the  relationship between efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone  layer and efforts to safeguard the global climate system;  (FCCC/CP/1998/L.7). The draft decisions were later adopted by  the COP without amendment. A draft decision on the development  and transfer of technology was prepared, although the Chair  noted that two Parties have concerns that will likely be raised  in the COP (FCCC/CP/19998/L.15).

The Chair described the results of joint SBSTA and SBI sessions.  A text of a possible decision on activities implemented jointly  (AIJ) contains some brackets (FCCC/CP/1998/CRP.2). No decision  on the flexibility mechanisms was reached and two draft texts  will be forwarded to the COP (FCCC/CP/1998/MISC.7 and Add.1). On  preparations for COP/MOP-1, the text retains brackets and blank  sections will be filled in later as information becomes  available (FCCC/CP/1998/CRP.4). He indicated the group had a  strong interest in compliance and a body may be needed to  continue this work.

The President asked if a decision on the transfer of technology  could be adopted. The US said it was important to ensure  consistency between this text and one concerning the GEF. He  requested that the item be held open. Delegates agreed to  address the issue on Friday afternoon.

SBI Chair Bakary Kante presented the report of the SBI  (FCCC/SBI/1998/L.2). Regarding the calendar of meetings, he said  there was agreement on holding two meeting per year. He said the  draft decisions on: the calendar of meetings of Convention  bodies (FCCC/CP/L.14); national communications from Annex I  Parties (FCCC/CP/1998/L.10); review of information communicated  under Article 12 (FCCC/CP/1998/L.11); second review on adequacy  of Article 4.2(a) and (b) (FCCC/CP/1998/L12); and implementation  of Articles 4.8 and 4.9 (Decision3/CP.3 and Articles 2.3 and  3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol) (FCCC/CP/1998/L.9) have been  forwarded to the COP since agreement on their adoption had not  been reached. He informed the COP that SBI recommended a draft  decision on administrative and financial matters  (FCCC/CP/1998/L.13), which the COP adopted.

The COP-4 President proposed to convene a group of friends of  the president at the ministerial level to address the  outstanding issues from the SBI and SBSTA. Executive Secretary  Michael Zammit Cutajar informed delegates that Jordan has  offered to host COP-5. He said a final decision had not been  reached because financial matters are under discussion.

TURKEY said it had presented the FCCC to Parliament for  ratification. However, its Annex I and II status did not conform  to the country's economic circumstances. She requested  resolution of this issue at COP-5. LIBYA expressed hope that the  international community would prevent adverse economic impacts  from response measures. Sanctions have impeded environmental  improvements to oil production facilities, which violates  international agreements.

FORO DEL BUEN AYRE said the challenge facing COP-4 will lead to  new roles for NGOs. He described efforts to improve Latin  American regional NGO cooperation and supported local level  action. GLOBE (Global Legislators Organization for a Balanced  Environment) called on certain countries to end their 'dance of  the doomed' and acknowledge that without equity there can be no  bankable success. He sought a contraction budget with a  convergence mechanism that sets targets for all. Delegates  could, on Friday the 13th, face a 'full stop COP' if they fail  to include language of equity into work programmes. ICFTU  (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) highlighted  the potential of trade unions to effect change in the workplace.  He said mitigation policies and measures should minimize adverse  effects on workers and transition strategies were necessary.

ICC (International Chamber of Commerce) and WBCSD (World  Business Council for Sustainable Development) underscored the  role of the private sector and the potential of voluntary  initiatives. They stressed, inter alia: transparency; low  transaction costs; incentives for early action; fungibility;  additionality without barriers; and supplementarity when cost  effective.

ICLEI (International Council for Local Environmental  Initiatives) outlined its Cities for Climate Protection  Campaign, which supports, inter alia, domestic policies and  measures, increased support to local governments and  supplementarity. The ARGENTINE MAYORS' ENVIRONMENTAL FORUM noted  the recommendations of the first Mayors' Environmental Forum  held in November 1998, which highlighted, inter alia: municipal  autonomy; local environmental policies; federal support; and  public participation.

KLIMA-B√úNDNIS (Climate Alliance), an association of European  cities committed to a 50% reduction of GHG by 2020, has  partnerships with indigenous peoples in the Amazon. He  highlighted respect and cultural diversity and expressed concern  over threats to the existence of forest-dependent communities,  including human rights issues.

CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK - LATIN AMERICA said that the COP should  recognize the failure of developed countries to reduce GHG  emissions, acknowledge that non-Annex I Parties were undertaking  significant efforts and determine that a global emissions budget  should be equitably shared. IUCN (World Conservation Union)  discussed the link between the issue of biodiversity and climate  change and called on the CBD and the FCCC to work together.

BCSE (Business Council for Sustainable Energy) and the EUROPEAN  BUSINESS COUNCIL FOR A SUSTAINABLE ENERGY FUTURE called for the  adoption of work plans with deadlines for each flexibility  mechanism, the implementation of a strong liability system and  support for model frameworks to encourage technological  agreements between developed and developing countries.

CLIMATE ACTION NETWORK - EUROPE stated that domestic actions by  industrialized countries should be furthered and a strict  compliance regime established. Flexibility mechanisms should not  be a way for Parties to evade domestic action and nuclear energy  is not an appropriate solution. FRANCISCANS INTERNATIONAL linked  GHG reduction to world peace and urged, inter alia, more concern  for ecosystems and small island states, equity, rejection of  consumerism and reverence for all creation.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As a result of the often bitter debate and 'bracket escalation,'  and the length of Tuesday night's session, several delegates  stated they were disappointed with the meeting. They hoped that  this experience would not thwart the progress of the  negotiations, but rather inspire a reassessment of the  deliberations and aspirations for the COP.
