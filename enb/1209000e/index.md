# PLENARY

In opening the session, INC Chair Rau'l Estrada-Oyuela  announced that AOSIS nominated Samoa as a COP Vice Chair.

### AGENDA ITEM 2 - ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FIRST SESSION OF THE  COP

Delegates adopted draft decision A/AC.237/L.25. The  Committee's report to the COP will also reflect that: the  Committee noted the agreement between the Interim  Secretariat and Germany for the COP; heads of organizations  have been invited to speak; and the Committee has requested  the Secretariat to draft the provisional agenda for COP-1.

AGENDA ITEM 5(b) - FINANCIAL RULES OF THE COP AND ITS  SUBSIDIARY BODIES: Regarding the draft budget outline  (A/AC.237/79/Add.3), the Russian Federation thought  consultations with the ACABQ would be useful. The EU, Japan  and Australia expressed doubts about bringing this matter  before the ACABQ. Australia and New Zealand supported  setting aside Secretariat funds for the IPCC. The Executive  Secretary said that consultations are underway on the type  of services the IPCC is expected to deliver and that the  Secretariat would possibly contribute 10-15% of the IPCC  budget.

The Chair later introduced document A/AC.237/L.26 on  financial rules. The G-77 and China agreed with the draft  decision, but reserved the right to revisit the paragraphs  on contributions and funds. Japan and the US asked questions  about paragraphs 7, 8 and 9 concerning the voluntary nature  of contributions. Kiribati, Ethiopia and Kuwait expressed  concern over the minimum contribution stated in paragraph  7(a). The Plenary will recommend the financial rules to the  COP with the proviso that all comments will be recorded in  the report.

AGENDA ITEM 5(a) - INSTITUTIONAL LINKAGES: The Chair asked  delegates to comment on A/AC.237/79/Add.1, Add.5 and Add.6.  The EU supported the recommendation that the Secretariat  should be attached to the UN without being incorporated into  any department or programme. Australia supported a  partnership between UNEP, UNDP and the DPCSD, but asked for  assurance of Secretariat autonomy. The Chair suggested  recommending that the COP request the Secretary- General to  propose a concrete arrangement for the administrative  management of the Secretariat.

# WORKING GROUP I

AGENDA ITEM 7(b) - REVIEW OF THE ADEQUACY OF COMMITMENTS:  Working Group I reviewed the draft proposal on adequacy of  commitments. China said that Annex I Parties have yet to  fulfill their current commitments and thus the Group could  not consider the Co-Chair's draft proposal. The EU wanted to  discuss the draft text while Kuwait wanted to bracket it.  Iran said that the different views should be reflected. The  US suggested amending the title to read 'Review of the  adequacy of Article 4.2(a) and (b).' In the Preamble, on the  tasks of the subsidiary bodies, Iran, Uruguay and India  suggested deleting references to the IPCC Chair's statement    and the annotated literature. Canada wanted to retain the  references, but they were deleted. Malaysia, supported by  the EU, proposed an amendment recognizing that the  commitments of Annex I Parties under Article 4.2(a) and (b)  are inadequate, which Kuwait opposed. Switzerland suggested  a reference to the 1994 IPCC Special Report's conclusion  that the stabilization of CO2 emissions at 1990 levels will  not lead to stabilization at any time during the next two  centuries. Australia added that the commitments do not deal  with the post-2000 period and apply only to Annex I Parties,  but Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, US, the EU and Nauru  disagreed.

China, supported by Korea and Brazil, objected to Germany's  proposed new categorization of some developing countries.  New Zealand said the draft text only notes the proposals by  Germany and AOSIS, and does not indicate agreement. Brazil  suggested that the text only note that the proposals were  presented. Trinidad and Tobago said the submission of the  AOSIS draft protocol must be registered. Germany said the  two protocols deserved reference.

China proposed: 'Many countries emphasize that the full  implementation of existing commitments under the Convention  is the most important step that developed country Parties  should take at this stage.' Australia, supported by the US,  felt that this was not consistent with the rest of the  document since it was a selective representation of views.  The Chair suggested amending China's proposal to read,  'Emphasizing that....' The EU, supported by the US,  suggested replacing 'the most important' with 'is an  essential.' Kuwait and Mali disagreed. Debate also ensued on  whether reference should be made 'in particular' to Annex I  Parties.

In the afternoon, Trinidad and Tobago suggested additional  language for paragraph 1(iv), on comments made at INC-11,  referring to statements by a majority of Annex I Parties  acknowledging the inadequacy of their commitments. France  argued against including opinions that lacked consensus.

In paragraph 1(iv)(b), which recommends that the COP  establish a follow-up process, Iran, supported by Venezuela,  recommended replacing 'establish' a follow-up process with  'continue.'  Trinidad and Tobago recommended: 'initiate a  negotiating process aimed at adopting a protocol containing'  specific emissions targets and concluding not later than  COP-II. China, supported by Poland and Korea, requested  deleting 'establish a process' and the second sentence  referring to the modalities and schedule of the process.  Several OECD countries supported the Co-Chairs' text as  drafted. Australia said the Trinidad and Tobago proposal was  unacceptable because it assumed the aim of negotiations was  a protocol that had not been discussed. Canada suggested  'establish a negotiating process aimed at taking appropriate  action towards meeting the ultimate objective of the  Convention.' The US suggested 'establish and elaborate a  process....'  China, supported by Iran, Uganda and Kuwait, said paragraph   1(c), urging Parties to contribute to the process, should be  deleted because it referred to an undefined process in  paragraph 1(b). China, Brazil and Malaysia wanted to delete  paragraph 1(d), establishing a consultative mechanism with  international business, because it is beyond the  intergovernmental scope of the Convention. The US and New  Zealand supported retaining the paragraph. The Netherlands  suggested 'consider ways to improve communication between  the Convention bodies and the business community.' Kenya  said 1(d) was not related to adequacy. The Chair said the  question would be placed into ongoing consultations on  linkages between subsidiary bodies and the outside  community.

On Paragraph 2, recommending a compilation of documents  submitted by Parties by end of the meeting, China changed  'submitted' to 'transmitted.' The US asked to extend the  deadline for submission, but the Secretariat said the 17  February deadline was necessary to prepare for COP-1.

AGENDA ITEM 7(c) -CRITERIA FOR JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: Working  Group I began reviewing the Co-Chairs' draft text on the  criteria for joint implementation at 8:20 pm. The  Philippines, on behalf of the G-77 and China, presented its  proposals stating that they were 'end-of-the-line'  positions.

The G-77 and China proposal retains the first two paragraphs  on joint implementation discussions and Article 4.2(d),  mandating the COP to take decisions regarding criteria for  joint implementation, but eliminates the third paragraph,  which refers to relevant documentation. The US questioned  this deletion and said that no compromise had been  demonstrated in G-77 text. Australia and US asked for time  to consult, while the EU preferred to discuss the points of  divergence between the two drafts.

Paragraph 4, on national policies and mitigation measures  applicable only to Annex I Parties, was retained as  paragraph 3 of the G-77 proposal. Paragraph 4 of the G-77  proposal emphasizes that according to the Convention, only  Annex I Parties have obligations to limit greenhouse gas  emissions and developing countries have no such obligation,  and footnotes preambular paragraph 3 of the Convention. The  US amended the paragraph and added a reference to Article  4.2(b) in place of 'greenhouse gas emissions.' The G-77 and  China objected. The Co-Chair said that both amendments will  be reflected but the US preferred bracketing the G-77 text.  The Chair cautioned that brackets be used only as a last  option. Australia suggested referring to the provisions of  Article 4.2(a). Norway also reserved on the G-77 text.  Senegal asked how progress could be made with everything  pending.

The G-77 proposal deleted paragraph 5 (no shifting of  emission limitations commitments to non-Annex I Parties) and  paragraph 6 (JI shall not be used to introduce new  obligations for non-Annex I Parties) of the Co-Chairs'  draft. The EU wanted to retain it.

Entrenched positions resulted in gridlock. When the   interpreters left at 10:30 pm, delegates attempted to  'negotiate' in English. It was uncertain if negotiations  would continue past midnight.

The following is a summary of the points of divergence  between the Co-Chairs' draft and the G-77 proposal.  Paragraph 5 of the G-77 proposal acknowledges that joint  activities to address climate change undertaken between  developed country Parties and developing country Parties are  different from joint implementation, and incorporates  paragraph 8 (promotion of sustainable development  objectives, technology cooperation, transfer, etc.) and  paragraph 9 (financing of JI activities to be independent  from and additional to obligations of Annex II Parties) of  the Co-Chairs' draft. Paragraph 1(b) of the G-77 proposal  now includes the following criteria: joint implementation is  applicable to Annex I Parties only; no credits will be  obtained by developed country Parties during the pilot  phase; and criteria for joint implementation, according to  Article 4.2(d), will be developed at COP-1. Paragraph 2 is  the same in both drafts.

# WORKING GROUP II

Working Group II completed its work Wednesday afternoon by  adopting three draft decisions.

### AGENDA ITEM 8 - ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL MECHANISM

The Co-Chair invited comments on the draft decisions in  A/AC.237/WG.II/L.10 on modalities, A/AC.237/WG.II/L.11 on  policy guidance, and A/AC.237/WG.II/L.13 on temporary  arrangements between the GEF and the Committee.

### A/AC.237/WG.II/L.10

The Co-Chair suggested inserting  'keeping in mind comments by delegations' in paragraph 2,  which recalls the INC mandate to prepare for COP-1. The G-77  said the phrase was inadequate because the draft referred to   document A/AC.237/87 without mentioning the proposed G-77  amendments, and suggested inserting 'as amended' after the  reference. However, the EU, the US and the UK did not want  to accord 'amendment' status to the G-77 proposals since  there had been no substantive debate. The Group adopted the  draft and agreed to note the delegations' comments.

### A/AC.237/WG.II/L.11

The Co-Chair stated that most  paragraphs in this decision had already been agreed upon.  Delegates agreed on paragraphs 1-6. India suggested adding a  reference to Articles 4.3, 4.5 and 4.7 in paragraph 7 to  emphasize the importance of technology transfer, but the UK  and the US did not want to reference any articles. The  Russian Federation suggested a reference to developing  countries and countries with economies in transition, but  the G-77 objected.  China requested that the Secretariat  develop a list of technology transferable free of charge,  but the EU, the UK, the US, Russia, Germany and Australia  objected, stating that they did not disagree with the idea  but with the timing. The Group agreed to delete the portion  of paragraph 8 recommending that the COP continue preparing  guidelines on format and content of communications for non- Annex 1 Parties.

### A/AC.237/WG.II/L.13

The Co-Chair introduced   A/AC.237/WG.II/L.13, which gives guidance to the GEF. He  highlighted paragraph 2, on the maintenance of interim  arrangements, and paragraph 3, on the modalities for the  functioning of operational linkages between the COP and the  GEF. Delegates adopted L.13, provided its structure is  modified to be consistent with L.11.

### AGENDA ITEM 9 - PROVISION TO DEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTIES OF  TECHNICAL AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT

Delegates adopted a six- paragraph addition to paragraph 70 of the draft report of  the Committee. The first five paragraphs summarize the  discussion on this item and the sixth paragraph requests the  Interim Secretariat to continue to facilitate the provision  of technical and financial support.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The OPEC countries are actively lobbying for an amendment to  the Rules of Procedure on the composition of the Bureau.  Their proposed amendment for Rule 22 (Officers) would add a  member of the Bureau from the oil exporting developing  countries, to complement the member from the small island  developing States. Although this amendment lacks consensus,  some delegates fear that it will not be withdrawn and, as a  result, the final compromise might have negative  implications for their group.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### PLENARY

The Plenary will have to reach agreement on all  outstanding issues today, including the Rules of Procedure  and the location of the Permanent Secretariat.
