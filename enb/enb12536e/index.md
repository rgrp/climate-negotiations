# SBI

## ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS:

On the agenda (FCCC/SBI/2012/1), MALAYSIA, supported by CHINA, BRAZIL, EGYPT, INDIA and others, highlighted the sensitivity of the agenda sub-item on information contained in non-Annex I national communications. BRAZIL, INDIA, SAUDI ARABIA, SWAZILAND, SUDAN and others emphasized that retaining the item in abeyance would constitute the most efficient use of time. Nauru, for the ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND STATES (AOSIS), stressed the need for full substantive discussion on the item and the EUROPEAN UNION (EU) called for compilation and synthesis of information contained in non-Annex I national communications.

SBI Chair Tomasz Chruszczow (Poland) noted that reaching consensus on this issue appeared impossible. He proposed, and parties agreed, to adopt the agenda with the sub-item on information contained in non-Annex I national communications held in abeyance.

## OPENING STATEMENTS:

Algeria, for the G-77/CHINA, stressed the importance of funding for non-Annex I national communications and continuing the Consultative Group of Experts on Non-Annex I National Communications (CGE). He said international consultation and analysis (ICA) should be operationalized in a non-intrusive manner and that the registry for nationally appropriate mitigation actions (NAMAs) must take into account the diversity of developing country actions. The G-77/CHINA called for progress on the review of the Adaptation Fund and development of national adaptation plans, and identified intellectual property rights and the host of the Technology Mechanism as serious hurdles. Nauru, for AOSIS, called for: a compilation and synthesis report on non-Annex I national communications; further elaboration of the NAMA process, including a simplified procedure for least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing States (SIDS); establishing an international mechanism to address loss and damage at COP 18; and a new programme on Convention Article 6 (education, training and public awareness). Swaziland, for the AFRICAN GROUP, stressed the importance of: national adaptation plans; loss and damage; and further work on Convention Article 6. He emphasized the need to avoid focusing on developing country voluntary mitigation actions, and said ICA for developing countries must be kept distinct from international analysis and review (IAR) for developed countries. He also called for equal balance of adaptation projects and removal of the co-financing requirements. Australia, for the UMBRELLA GROUP, highlighted the importance of measuring, reporting and verification (MRV) and the SBI s role in implementing related decisions. He called for progress on adaptation, and identified the need for a decision on the host of the Technology Mechanism and the creation of an advisory body for the Climate Technology Center and Network (CTCN). The Republic of Korea, for the ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY GROUP (EIG), called for progress on: the MRV package, ICA technical expert teams; NAMA registry prototype; work programme on loss and damage; candidates to host the Climate Technology Centre (CTC); Adaptation Fund; and review of the design of the commitment period reserve. He urged grouping all matters on response measures under a single agenda item. The EU called for progress on: national adaptation plans, in particular with relation to LDCs; host of the CTC; capacity-building; NAMA registry; and modalities for the ICA. He highlighted that all issues related to response measures have found their new home in the forum on response meausres. Dominican Republic, for the COALITION OF RAINFOREST NATIONS, urged for continued discussion on NAMAs, in particular composition, modalities and procedures of technical experts under ICA, and highlighted the need for full support for developing country national communications. He called for addressing the implementation of REDD+ activities by developing countries and emphasized the lack of funding to operationalize them. The Gambia, for the LDCs, identified the need for guidance to the Global Environment Facility (GEF) from COP 18 on national adaptation plan formulation in LDCs. He stressed the importance of all parties being able to access information on available NAMA support in the NAMA registry. Honduras, for the CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM (SICA), called for progress on: adaptation in regions of high vulnerability enabled by adequate, predictable, sustained and additional financial resources; and the work programme on loss and damage that should focus on harm prevention and reduction rather than risk assessment. IRAN supported the candidacy of the Research Institute for Petroleum Industries (Iran) to host the CTC.

YOUTH suggested a permanent programme on Convention Article 6 with robust performance indicators and urged for action to address loss and damage.

## CONVENTION ARTICLES 4.8 AND 4.9:

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The Bonn Climate Change Conference opened on a sunny Monday morning. The mood of delegates gathering in the familiar surroundings of the Maritim Hotel was positive, although many joked that they now know the city and conference venue by heart. We ve had nearly a 6-month break in the formal negotiations, but many of us have already been spending quite a bit of time in Bonn recently for workshops and the informal meeting in early May. While the surroundings were well-known, there was also a feeling of anticipation regarding the post-Durban process, including the newly established ADP. Many commented that they were looking forward to commencing work under the new ADP on Wednesday; however, few seemed to have a clear sense of the timeline and substance. Meanwhile, the various new bodies were generating new dynamics in the process, ripe with rumors that nominations were proving difficult. This was confirmed in the evening, with the SBI plenary finishing business for the day without having resolved the process of how nominations for the various bodies should be considered. As the SBs opened, technology was very much on the agenda. Along with the ubiquitous iPads and iPhones sported by delegates, technology permeated conversation in the corridors with delegates expressing different views on the host of the CTC. The importance of resolving the issue came up in the SBSTA, SBI and a press conference with UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres. Some delegates favored the Caribbean as host, others emphasized the need for the CTC to be in a developing country, while one recommendation noted the Republic of Korea as an option due to their technological advancements. Whatever the case, technology will remain a key part of the climate conversation in Bonn.
