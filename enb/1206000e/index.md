# PLENARY

The Plenary held informal consultations on the Rules of  Procedure in the morning and discussed arrangements for COP- 1  and the Permanent Secretariat in the afternoon.

### AGENDA ITEM 6 - RULES OF PROCEDURE

The Chair of the  informal consultations, Amb. T.P. Sreenivasan, proposed that  delegates exchange views on the outstanding issues in the  Rules of Procedure (A/AC.237/L.22/Rev.1) and then establish  a drafting group to work out the details.

Rule 4 (Dates of Sessions): Delegates could not reach  agreement on the bracketed sentence prohibiting COP sessions  during religious holidays of a significant number of  delegates. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Sudan called for its  retention. France (on behalf of the EU), Fiji, Australia,  Kenya, Benin and the UK understood the concerns, however,  worried about setting a precedent. Furthermore, many agreed  that the second paragraph of Rule 4 allows for enough  flexibility in setting the dates of meetings.

Rule 6 (Observers): Delegates agreed to remove the brackets  so that 'any international entity or entities entrusted by  the COP pursuant to Article 11 of the Convention with the  operation of the financial mechanism' can be represented at  the COP as observers.

Rule 12 (Agenda): Two issues remain: should the Secretariat  consult with the President or the Bureau when submitting  additional items for the agenda, and should there be a time  limit. Some delegates proposed replacing this rule with Rule  11 from the Biodiversity Convention's Rules of Procedure.  Others thought that the submission of agenda items was  covered in Rules 10 and 13.

Rule 27 (Subsidiary Bodies): For Paragraph 2, on  establishing subsidiary bodies, the Parties agreed to delete  'by consensus,' and to begin the paragraph with a reference  to Article 7(2)(i).

For paragraph 4, on meetings of subsidiary bodies, the EU  and Argentina commented that convening the meetings in  conjunction with the sessions of the COP would not allow the  Secretariat time to disseminate the results. China, Saudi  Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, and Kuwait said their staffs  were limited and meetings in conjunction with the COP would  allow for better use of resources.

Rule 42 (Voting): The major issues to be resolved include  the general rule on matters of procedure, deviations from  that rule; the general rule on matters of substance, the  rule on the adoption of protocol, and the rule on financial  matters. Numerous delegates said that matters of procedure  should be decided by a simple majority. There was  disagreement on whether matters of substance and/or  protocols should be decided by consensus or, if that fails,  by a 2/3 or a 3/4 majority.

### AGENDA ITEM 2 - ARRANGEMENTS FOR COP-1

The Interim  Secretariat introduced the relevant document A/AC.237/78,  Add.1 and Add.2 and invited the Plenary to comment on the  establishment of a sessional Committee of the Whole,   participation in the debate during the ministerial segment  and duration of statements.  The EU stressed the importance  of paragraph 42 of A/AC.237/78 allowing for endorsement of  the INC's recommendations without referring them to the  Committee of the Whole.  Germany and Hungary commented on  the need for a productive ministerial segment. The Plenary  accepted the suggestions in the document. The Chair reported  on preliminary consultations concerning the election of  officers for COP-1 and the subsidiary bodies.  The head of  the German delegation will serve as President. There will be  seven Vice-Presidents, a Rapporteur and the Chairs of the  two subsidiary bodies.

### AGENDA ITEM 10 -- REVIEW OF ACTIVITIES OF THE INTERIM  SECRETARIAT

The Interim Secretariat introduced document  A/AC.237/80, a review of Secretariat activities and  extrabudgetary funds. He explained the geographic diversity  of the staff, estimates for funding needs and contributions  to the Special Voluntary Fund. The EU, supported by Germany,  Switzerland and Canada, proposed a working group to address  budgetary matters and asked that it review the 1995 and  1996/97 budgets.

### AGENDA ITEM 5 - DESIGNATION OF A PERMANENT SECRETARIAT

The  Chair introduced document A/AC.237/79 on designation of the  Permanent Secretariat, and distributed A/AC.237/79/Add.5,  Conclusions of the Contact Group, and Add.6, Institutional  linkages.

Institutional Linkages: The Chair summarized the document  and said they would discuss this further on Monday.

Financial rules of the COP and its subsidiary bodies: The  Chair reported that in A/AC.237/79/Add.5, the Contact Group  on the Permanent Secretariat analyzed both the financial  procedures and the budget outline for 1996/97. The Contact  Group supported the establishment of a Finance Committee,  consisting of 10-15 Parties, which could meet during  sessions of the COP or the subsidiary bodies. The Contact  Group also proposed establishing a small group at this  session to study the 1996/97 budget outline.

Physical Location: The Contact Group recommended that the  Committee take three criteria into account in assessing the  offers to host the Permanent Secretariat: convenience of  access by delegations to the Permanent Secretariat and  meetings; possible budgetary savings by locating the  Secretariat near other UN offices or secretariats; and the  contribution offered by the potential host government in  cash and/or in kind.

Italy and Poland supported Bonn. Mexico supported Toronto.  Australia supported Geneva, because co-location of  secretariats allows cross-fertilization among secretariat  personnel and saves costs. It also saves costs for  governments that would be able to maintain fewer diplomatic  missions. For similar reasons, the US, New Zealand and  Norway also prefer Geneva. The Russian Federation and Japan  have not completed their analyses of the proposals. Zimbabwe  is flexible. Nigeria said that economics and co-location are  logical considerations, but hoped that this would not   prevent developing countries from hosting other UN  secretariats. Canada added that the logic of the Contact  Group's report is that if a city is not a UN center, it  should not apply.

# WORKING GROUP I

Working Group I concluded its discussion of Joint  Implementation, considered subsidiary bodies, and conducted  informal negotiations on the Co-Chair's draft decision on  methodological issues.

AGENDA ITEM 7(c) - JOINT IMPLEMENTATION: The Netherlands  noted its experimental joint implementation (JI) programme  and expressed regret that JI projects initiated prior to the  pilot phase may not be credited. Kenya suggested that the  COP should establish a clearinghouse for transfer of  technologies employed in the JI pilot phase, so that  developing country participants are not left at the mercy of  the private sector. The Chair proposed establishing a  contact group to resolve differences.

AGENDA ITEM 7(e) - SUBSIDIARY BODIES: The Secretariat  presented document A/AC.237/85 on the roles of the  subsidiary bodies. France, on behalf of the EU, supported by  Canada and others, endorsed the SBSTA's two technical  advisory panels. The EU added that the review of adequacy of  commitments should be given to an ad hoc committee. The US  thought this was the SBI's responsibility. Australia said  that both bodies are the engine of the COP and the  Convention, and added that an ad hoc committee under SBI  review the adequacy of commitments. Benin pointed out that  periodic reports on the implementation of the Convention had  not been included. Japan called for limiting the number of  working languages. New Zealand said that the SBSTA should  serve as the link between IPCC and the COP, and the  negotiation of any new instrument strengthening the  Convention should be under the SBI. The US called for a  clear division of responsibilities with the SBSTA offering  guidelines used to produce national communications, and the  SBI evaluating the synthesis report based on measures and  policies from national communications. The US also stressed  the need for maintaining the intellectual objectivity of the  IPCC. The Philippines, on behalf of G-77 and China, said  that the SBSTA should not be subordinated to the SBI as if  they were parallel bodies, and added that the SBSTA should  work out guidelines for the IPCC report. China said that  given the importance of both bodies, all six UN working  languages were required. Malawi said that the IPCC should  not be subordinated to the SBSTA.

AGENDA ITEM 7(d) - METHODOLOGIES: The Chair initiated  informal consultations on Item 7(d), Methodological Issues.  China objected to paragraph 1(b) directing non-Annex I  parties to use IPCC guidelines in preparing their national  communications. He said the guidelines are too bulky,  complicated and expensive for developing countries to  implement. He suggested developing country Parties would  work out comparable guidelines for their own use. The Chair  pointed to the phrase 'as appropriate and to the extent   possible' and developed country Parties' discretionary use  of the guidelines as giving developing countries  flexibility. China, supported by Malaysia, Saudi Arabia,  Senegal, India, Kuwait, Micronesia and Iran, suggested  changing the phrase to 'as appropriate and to the extent  possible simplified.' The G-77 asked for further time to  study the draft decision to develop a common position.

The US, supported by the EU, the Netherlands, Japan, Canada  and Australia, said it was concerned about the form and  nature of the simplification, who would simplify the  guidelines, how transparency would be maintained, and what  revising the guidelines might cost. China responded that the  G-77 and China would revise the guidelines, that  transparency was a relative term in light of some Annex 1  communications, and that simplified guidelines would cost  less to apply than scholastic, bombastic and complicated  forms from the existing guidelines. France, on behalf of the  EU, said 'simplified' leaves a broad scope for  interpretation, and suggested that developing countries  could use IPCC default guidelines. The Chair asked if China  would accept adding 'defaults,' but China reiterated that  the IPCC guidelines are too cumbersome. As a compromise, the  Chair suggested amending the text to read that non-Annex I  Parties could use IPCC guidelines 'or the simplified default  methodologies adopted by the IPCC' and leave the original  text to read 'as appropriate and to the extent possible.'  China said the IPCC should not give instructions on  reporting to sovereign States, but agreed to accept the  Chair's suggestion.

The EU suggested adding language to paragraph 1(c) to read  'provided that the inventories are compiled on a fully  disaggregated and detailed gas-by-gas basis and that the  methodologies and calculations are transparent,' and 'on a  provisional basis' so that new IPCC methodologies could be  added in the future. China said the amendment sounded like  bombs to developing countries. France said the language  could be amended to refer to previous decisions of the INC  on guidelines, inventories and national communications.  China accepted 'taking account the decisions of the INC' and  the paragraph was adopted.

In sub-paragraph 1(d)(ii), the EU added that the SBSTA  provide advice to the COP and the SBI. China said that under  the Convention both the SBSTA and SBI are parallel  organizations and suggested that SBSTA provide advice to the  COP and not the SBI. The UK agreed that the bodies are  parallel, but that Article 9 of the Convention states that  the SBSTA was established to provide advice to the COP and,  as appropriate, its other subsidiary bodies.

In sub-paragraph 1(d)(iv) on a work plan and timetable on  the allocation and control of emissions from international  bunker fuels, the EU added a new sub-paragraph that the  SBSTA, with the guidance of SBI, take into account ongoing  work in governments and IGOs. In Paragraph 2 on the  contribution of relevant organizations, including the IPCC  to the work of the SBSTA, the EU suggested adding   'scientific aspects of' before 'methodologies.' The Working  Group then informally accepted the text. The G-77 and China  asked for time to review the 'deja vu' document and the  Working Group was adjourned.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

It appears as though governments that want to host the  Permanent Secretariat have not limited themselves to  lobbying other governments. In an interesting role reversal,  some government delegates are lobbying NGOs for their  support. In the end, however, it will be the governments'  decision. As of Friday, consensus had not emerged. The  current tally, according to Plenary statements, is: Bonn  (2); Geneva (4); Toronto (1); Montevideo (0); and undecided  (3).
