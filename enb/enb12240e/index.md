# SBI CONTACT GROUPS

### UNFCCC ARTICLE 6

Parties considered revised draft conclusions,  agreeing on the text and completing their deliberations. Parties  discussed whether 2007 will mark the end of the first or second  phase of work and agreed that a review could come before this  date. Regarding the submission of reports on progress achieved in  implementing Article 6, SAINT LUCIA suggested providing greater  encouragement for Parties to submit new or updated information for  inclusion in the intermediate review process of the New Delhi work  programme. Noting that the EU would be unable to provide such  additional information by the deadline, the EU opposed. He  underscored the value of the review to consider information from  all Parties. Regarding the possibility for non-Annex I Parties to  access GEF funds for Article 6 activities, delegates clarified  that this only applies to activities in the context of national  communications. The GAMBIA stressed the importance of a feedback  mechanism to continuously review the clearing house.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

This contact group met twice.  In the morning, delegates negotiated draft conclusions proposed by  Chair Sok Appadu on: the work of the Consultative Group of Experts  (CGE); provision of financial and technical support; and  submission of second, and where appropriate, third national  communications.

Delegates also discussed a draft decision proposed by the  G-77/China, calling on the GEF to report to the COP on the  operational modalities and approval procedures of the UNDP/UNEP  Umbrella Project for financing the preparation of non-Annex I  national communications. The EU and US pointed to the fact that  the GEF reports to the COP, and said further information can be  obtained on the Internet. BARBADOS noted that, although the GEF  is mandated to approve projects on an expedited basis, there is  no forum to address problems with this process. The US proposed  a question-and-answer session with the GEF during UNFCCC sessions.  The EU expressed willingness to show flexibility on the issue.

In the evening, delegates approved the draft conclusions on the  CGE and financial and technical support. Parties started  discussing a draft decision on the periodicity of non-Annex I  national communications, including a suggestion for a three-year  cycle proposed by the EU, a four-year cycle from draft text  discussed during SBI-19, and a six-year cycle proposed by the  G-77/China.

In support of her delegation's proposal, the EU, supported by  JAPAN and the US, said, inter alia, that: capacity and  infrastructure is enhanced after completion of initial national  communications, facilitating the preparation of subsequent  national communications; frequent submissions of national  communications will result in more funds; and a longer time-frame  will encourage inefficiency. THAILAND said non-Annex I Parties  require time to ensure that national communications provide the  necessary information.

Several non-Annex I Parties pointed out that, despite greater  capacity and resources, a number of Annex I Parties had taken  three years to prepare their initial communications. The  G-77/CHINA highlighted that UNFCCC Article 12.5 (frequency of  submission) mandates the COP to decide on the frequency of  subsequent communications of all Parties. JAPAN said a decision on  the frequency of funding will inform the discussions on the fourth  replenishment of the GEF.

Unable to reach consensus on this issue, delegates discussed  options calling on non-Annex I Parties to submit proposals as soon  as possible, even in advance of substantial completion of their  previous national communication for second, and where appropriate,  third national communications. The G-77/CHINA, supported by  THAILAND and SAUDI ARABIA, opposed text in the EU's proposal,  which calls on non-Annex I Parties to submit project proposals not  later than one year after submission of their previous  communication. The G-77/CHINA expressed concern that this  reference could be interpreted as a deadline by the GEF.

Parties were unable to reach a decision. Chair Appadu said the  entire text, including the conclusions that had been agreed on and  further proposals from the US, EU, G-77/CHINA and AUSTRALIA, will  be forwarded to SBI-21 for negotiation.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

Delegates considered  draft conclusions, finalizing their deliberations. On arrangements  for COP-10, the US, supported by JAPAN, suggested deleting  reference to statements by groups in the opening ceremony,  recognizing instead that Parties will be expected largely to  contribute through their participation in the panel discussions.  On themes to be considered by panels, NORWAY and ICELAND expressed  disappointment at lack of inclusion of the theme of energy. The  EU, ICELAND and CANADA requested its re-insertion. On the theme of  climate change mitigation, SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/China,  suggested that benefits and adverse impacts be considered.  SWITZERLAND suggested focusing on approaches and opportunities.  After exchanging further views, Parties agreed to discuss  'mitigation of climate change, policies and their impacts.' On effective participation in the UNFCCC process, the US expressed  surprise that Parties were not in agreement on the interpretation  that meeting attendance implies physical presence. He proposed an  additional paragraph taking note of the concern expressed with  respect to the interpretation of the Rules of Procedure of the CDM  EB. He said that since adopting decision 18/CP.9 (guidance to the  CDM EB), which contains reference to the concern, no changes have  been made in the practices of the CDM EB. The EU opposed the  additional text proposed by the US. He said the process will not  change as a result of only one Party's concern. Chair Sach  suggested reflecting the US' concern in the SBI-20 proceedings,  rather than in the conclusions. The US expressed disappointment.  ARGENTINA and NORWAY agreed to reflect the US' concern in the  conclusions. Parties agreed.

Delegates also addressed reference to UN initiatives aimed at  enhancing the relationship between the UN system and civil  society. The G-77/CHINA said the initiatives should be considered  as background information. The EU stressed the importance of the  initiatives.

On participation by observer organizations, the G-77/CHINA  preferred to continue consideration of the admission of observer  organizations at future sessions. The US said government  organizations are also eligible for participation as observers  under UNFCCC Article 7.6 (participation of observers).

### IMPLEMENTATION OF DECISION 5/CP.7

The contact group considered a  revised draft decision. Parties said their positions on the  progress of implementing response measures remained unchanged and  agreed to leave text bracketed. On insurance, the EU emphasized  that the impact of implementing response measures is not an  insurable risk and, supported by the US, requested deleting text  to this effect. The US questioned the use of a forum on insurance  and the basis for the proposed elements of its work programme.  SAUDI ARABIA emphasized the need for continuous discussions on  insurance. He suggested that the forum, composed of interested  Parties, representatives of intergovernmental organizations, the  financial and insurance sector, meet bi-annually. Regarding  modeling, the EU, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, suggested deleting  reference to establishing an expert group. Negotiations continued  late into the night.

# SBSTA CONTACT GROUPS

### R&SO

Delegates considered revised draft conclusions. Parties  agreed to the US' proposal to request submissions for  consideration by SBSTA-21 and SBSTA-22 on how to adequately  address the main issues that arose from the SBSTA-20 event on  research in response to the IPCC TAR. Parties agreed on the draft  conclusions with this, and other minor changes.

### P&MS

Co-Chair Anders Turesson introduced revised draft conclusions,  noting that the text incorporated proposals from the EU, G-77/CHINA,  and US. SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/China, opposed by the US, EU,  AUSTRALIA and JAPAN, suggested deleting text referring to decision  13/CP.7 (P&Ms), preferring instead to include language from the  same decision. Co-Chair Turesson proposed to include the decision  language while retaining the option to refer to the decision,  depending on negotiations on the remaining text. Parties agreed.  On exchange of information on P&Ms, JAPAN, opposed by the  G-77/CHINA, proposed adding reference to sectoral differences.  The reference was bracketed. The G-77/CHINA requested to delete  wording that indicated exchange of 'any information' by  non-Annex I Parties by SBSTA-22. Following informal consultations,  reference to sectoral differences and 'any information' was removed  and agreement was reached on the draft conclusions.

### SMALL-SCALE A&R PROJECTS UNDER THE CDM

Chair Thelma Krug reported  on progress in informal consultations. Delegates agreed to  continue work at SBSTA-21, with a view to recommending a decision  to COP-10. Chair Krug then presented a revised version of Appendix  B on baseline and monitoring methodologies, noting that these  provide further guidance to the CDM EB to develop simplified  methodologies for selected types of A&R projects. The revised  version of Appendix B was accepted with minor changes.

On measures to facilitate small-scale A&R CDM project activities,  PERU, supported by BOLIVIA, CHILE, SENEGAL, COLOMBIA, and COSTA  RICA, proposed draft text for the decision that, inter alia:  encourages host Parties to put in place measures at the national  and sub-national levels, such as linking small-scale A&R project  activities to their sustainable development and poverty reduction  strategies; requests financial and technical resources to assist  developing country Parties in the areas set out in the decision's  annex to support project implementation; and urges the operating  entity of the financial mechanism to adopt a streamlined and  expedited procedure in financing activities for this purpose.  CANADA stressed its interest in substantive discussions on the  matter, and said project capacity building would be guided by  Canada's principles on strengthening aid effectiveness.

On bundling, BRAZIL proposed that the host Parties may coordinate  several small-scale A&R CDM activities with a view to diminishing  the costs of validation, verification and certification. He said  acceptance of the text would remove all brackets on bundling. The  EU, supported by JAPAN, said there was a role for the investor  Party in coordinating several small-scale project activities.  CANADA requested retaining the brackets on bundling, given  insufficient time to consider the issue.

BRAZIL, opposed by SWITZERLAND, proposed new text, pending  approval by the G-77/China, on confirmation of involvement by  low-income communities prior to validation. SENEGAL and INDIA said  they could not accept the text as a G-77/China proposal and  requested time for consultations. Following consultations, Parties  agreed that the text would remain bracketed as an alternative  proposal by a group of Parties within the G-77/China.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Observers discussed the significance of informal consultations on  aviation and maritime transport, which met on Wednesday for the  first time since COP-9. Some noted that, in contrast to other  discussions on organizational details of Parties' reports or  workshops, this issue has notable long-term implications for  emissions reductions. Others commented that a commitment to the  environment was not clearly visible, allowing Parties to continue  being bogged down by procedural and technical matters.
