# INFORMAL HIGH-LEVEL PLENARY - MORNING SESSION

Delegates convened in the morning for an informal high-level  Plenary session to hear reports by the facilitators on informal  consultations that met on Wednesday night. President Pronk opened  the meeting and invited the co-facilitators from the four groups  formed around key issue 'clusters' or 'boxes' to report on  progress made in negotiations.

### BOX A - CAPACITY BUILDING, TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER, ADVERSE EFFECTS  AND GUIDANCE TO THE GEF

Co-facilitators Ministers Mabudhafasi and  Auken reported that there had been some progress on technology  transfer and capacity building, while questions on the financial  issue remained. On adverse effects, Minister Auken said there was  deadlock on key issues, and that assistance from contact group co- chairs Salamat and Kjell√©n had been requested. He also said a  separate EU proposal on financial issues had been presented and  that, along with the proposal submitted by the Umbrella Group,  there was substantial material on which to negotiate.

### BOX B - MECHANISMS

Co-facilitator Minister Kawaguchi said there  were too many issues to deal with.  She said agreement was near on  details relating to the CDM, including: financial additionality;  fast track on small projects; use of share of proceeds from CDM  for adaptation; environmental additionality; no list for project  eligibility. Composition of the Executive Board and its  relationship with the COP/MOP remained undecided. She noted  progress on emissions trading, registries and participation, but  indicated that no agreement had been reached on liability. On the  cross-cutting issues, she stated that there was agreement on  eligibility of Annex I Parties to use mechanisms, but disagreement  on how to use share of proceeds, as well as on fungibility and  supplementarity. On joint implementation (JI), Parties were still  unable to agree on whether rules and guidelines should be  identical to the CDM, and whether there should be a two-track  approach.

### BOX C - LULUCF

Minister Carabias Lillo said the informal group on  LULUCF had split into two sub-groups the night before, with one  group focusing on the analysis of Article 3.4 (additional  activities), and the other on the inclusion of LULUCF activities  under the CDM.  On the work of the former, she said ideas had been  discussed for discounting some elements, such as pre-1990 carbon  uptake. On the latter, she reported a common view within the group  on the need to address permanence, and that discussions had  focused on the possibility for further SBSTA consideration, with  IPCC input, on this matter. She said approaches for a first pilot  phase of limited LULUCF projects had been considered.  She said  the LULUCF group had now reached its limits, and there was little  prospect of convergence.

### BOX D - COMPLIANCE, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND ACCOUNTING,  REPORTING AND REVIEW UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7, AND 8

Minister  Bjerke reported on the work carried out in the informal small  groups. On Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7 (communication of  information) and 8 (review of information), she said text on  reporting under Protocol Articles 10 (existing commitments) and 11  (financial mechanism) had been elaborated, and the only bracket  remaining in the decision on Article 8 related to the composition  of the expert review teams. She said further brackets remained on  issues that were dependent on the outcome of other groups.

On demonstrable progress, she said the group had converged around  the idea that reporting should take place in 2005, as a report  separate from national communications. Regarding compliance, she  said discussions had focused on the establishment and structure of  the compliance committee, the functions of the plenary, as well as  on how principles could be reflected in the compliance text. She  noted that more time was needed, as not all the 'crunch' issues  had been resolved.

President Pronk noted a greater divergence of opinion than he had  expected, and said there were three elements in the reports -  those issues that had been agreed, those close to agreement, and  those on which no agreement is currently foreseeable.  He said he  would summarize the issues in a paper that ministers would be  invited to collect at his office, to ensure that he would also be  able to conduct bilateral discussions with each group. Responding  to President Pronk's proposal, the G-77/CHINA noted that  developing countries have the highest stakes in these  negotiations, and that the total package, as in the Buenos Aires  Plan of Action, would need to be reflected. On the Umbrella  Group's funding proposal and the alternative put forward by the  EU, he said they represent a step forward but still require more  negotiation. He stressed that 'the ball is in the court of  developed countries,' saying they have the economic resources and  have caused the problem, and therefore it is their responsibility  to resolve this. The EU highlighted its funding proposal, which  focuses on the need to improve and increase funding for the GEF,  especially taking into consideration the needs of least developed  countries (LDCs), and suggests an 'adaptation fund plus' within  the existing GEF structure. She said funding should be derived not  only from a CDM levy, but also from contributions, and added that  assuring stable sources of funding was crucial.

On the way forward, President Pronk reassured delegates that the  state of negotiations today did not represent a set-back, just  'stagnation.' He noted the need for a break-through, and stressed  the crucial role of ministers in the informal groups.

# NOTE BY THE PRESIDENT OF COP-6

Shortly before 8:00 pm, a Note by the President of COP-6 was  distributed to delegates. The note was presented as an attempt by  President Pronk to provide a basis for further negotiations so as  to generate momentum, which he believed had stalled.

### INTRODUCTION

In the introduction, the note states that it  addresses key unresolved issues contained in the documents  transmitted to the COP by the subsidiary bodies at the close of  their thirteenth sessions on 18 November. It also draws on ideas  emerging during the course of negotiations, and takes into account  the 'state of play' at the conclusion of the four informal sub- groups launched on 21 November. The note does not address  outstanding issues relating to Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8,  suggesting these can be resolved once other issues have been dealt  with. It addresses outstanding issues in four sections based on  the 'clusters' or 'boxes' that formed the basis for negotiations  during the previous few days.

### BOX A

Funding mechanisms and guidance to the GEF:  President  Pronk's note proposes creating an Adaptation Fund, a Convention  Fund, and a Climate Resources Committee, as well as increasing  resources for climate change funding.

The Adaptation Fund would be a new fund under the GEF, created as  a trust fund, with special consideration given to the needs of the  LDCs and small island developing states (SIDs). This fund, to be  managed by the CDM Executive Board under the guidance of the  COP/MOP, would finance concrete adaptation projects in non-Annex I  Parties with finances generated by the share of proceeds on the  CDM and implemented by the UN implementing agencies.

The proposed Convention Fund would be a window under the GEF, with  separate guidance and special consideration given to the needs of  the LDCs and SIDs. It would be managed by the GEF Council and  function under special guidance of, and be accountable to, the  COP.  Under this window, Annex II Parties would provide new and  additional funds for activities in developing countries,  including: technology transfer and technical support; capacity  building relating to climate change; specific CDM capacity  building; and assistance with economic diversification. It would  also provide support to capacity building for economies in  transition (EITs).

The note also proposes increasing resources through other  channels, with the aim of reaching an annual level of one billion  US dollars by 2005. If this level is not reached, a levy would be  applied on JI and/or emissions trading. It also proposes the  establishment of a Climate Resources Committee at COP-7 to give  advice to existing financial channels and institutions - such as  the GEF and regional development banks - on how to increase  climate funding, on mainstreaming, and on monitoring and  assessment.

### Capacity building:

The note proposes a framework to guide capacity  building activities related to the UNFCCC and Protocol  implementation, in order to assist non-Annex II Parties.

### Technology transfer:

On technology transfer, it proposes the  establishment of an intergovernmental consultative group of  technical and scientific experts under SBSTA on the basis of equal  geographical distribution. This group would advise SBSTA on  further actions, focus on means of addressing the identified  barriers to technology transfer and facilitate information  exchange and review by creating a clearinghouse and regional  technology centers. SBSTA would review the group's work on a  regular basis and if necessary request the COP to take any further  actions.

### Adverse effects:

On adverse effects, the note outlines actions to  be taken by Annex II Parties, including: initiating  pilot/demonstration adaptation projects; undertaking adaptation  projects where sufficient information is available in specified  areas; and strengthening and establishing national and regional  centers, as well as information networks for rapid response to  extreme weather events.

The note also proposes actions to address the impacts of response  measures under Protocol Article 3.14.  It suggests that Annex I  and other Parties may report on their efforts to limit such  impacts of their implemented or future policies and measures in  their national communications, which will be reviewed under  Protocol Article 8, allowing flexibility for EITs.  The note  further puts forward actions by Annex II Parties to address  impacts of response measures on non-Annex I Parties under UNFCCC  Article 4.8, through concrete actions based on, inter alia,  further methodological work in economic diversification,  increasing energy efficiency in fossil fuel production, and  advanced fossil fuel technologies. These non-Annex I Parties  should also report their specific needs and concerns in their  national communications.

On the needs of LDCs, including SIDS, the note suggests: a  separate work programme to be financed by the GEF which will focus  on vulnerability and adaptation needs assessment, including  technology transfer and capacity building; development of national  adaptation programmes of action; implementation of concrete  adaptation projects; and the establishment of an LDC group of  experts. Also, in order to encourage a greater flow of CDM  projects to the LDCs, the note proposes that CDM projects in LDCs  be exempt from the share of proceeds for adaptation, and that the  implementation of 'small scale CDM projects' be promoted.

### BOX B Mechanisms:

The note proposes that the Executive Board  comprise equal numbers from each UN regional group, plus one  representative from the SIDS. Efforts shall be taken to reach  agreement by consensus, with a three-fourths majority vote as a  last resort. The Board shall be subject to the authority and  guidance of, and be accountable to, the COP/MOP. The note  advocates a prompt start for the CDM, with the Board to be elected  at the next session of the subsidiary bodies.

On CDM project eligibility, the note recognizes the Party's  discretion to evaluate a project's contribution to sustainable  development. It proposes that Annex I Parties declare their  intention to refrain from using nuclear facilities for generating  CERs, and that expedited consideration be given to energy  efficiency improvements and renewable energy. On supplementarity,  it proposes that Annex I Parties meet their emission commitments  primarily through domestic action, and that compliance be assessed  by the facilitative branch of the compliance committee on the  basis of qualitative and quantified information.

On trading modalities and liability, the note proposes that Annex  I Parties retain a portion of their assigned amounts (AAs) in  their national registries, specific to that commitment period, and  that this portion shall be 70% of their AAs, or the portion  determined on the basis of projected or recent emissions. This  shall be recalculated and if necessary adjusted after the annual  review of each Party's emissions data.

On fungibility, the note proposes, inter alia, that emission  reduction units and parts of assigned amounts may be exchanged  according to rules and procedures to be established by the  COP/MOP. The note advocates fostering of equitable distribution of  CDM projects. Provision is made for fostering LDC participation in  the CDM.

On JI, the note proposes that no stringent procedures are needed  on verification if Parties meet reporting requirements, but that  Parties failing to meet these requirements should follow CDM  procedures.

### BOX C LULUCF:

The note proposes that Parties apply the FAO  definition of 'forest' under Article 3.3, taking national  circumstances into consideration, and apply the IPCC definition  for afforestation, reforestation and deforestation. It suggests  that the biome-specific approach to the forest definition be  further investigated.

In terms of additional activities under Article 3.4 in the first  commitment period, the note suggests that Parties be allowed to  include grazing and cropland management, forest management, and  revegetation. To address the problem of scale, an upper limit of  credits amounting to 3% of a Party's base year emissions would be  set. Furthermore, Parties would receive full credits for Article  3.4 activities up to a level canceling out a possible Article 3.3  debit, as long as the total forest stock is growing. Above this  level, 85% of the credit would be reduced from forest management  activities, and 30% from other Article 3.4 activities, in order to  discount for non-direct human induced effects and uncertainty.  This 'factoring out' process would be reviewed periodically. The  COP/MOP would be requested to review the list of agreed Article  3.4 activities and accounting rules and guidelines prior to  setting emissions commitments for the second and consecutive  commitment periods.

On LULUCF under the CDM, the note proposes that Parties allow  afforestation and reforestation. Conservation projects would not  be allowed, but would be prioritized under the adaptation fund. A  process would be established under SBSTA, with IPCC input, to  develop rules and modalities to deal with issues such as non- permanence, social and environmental effects, leakage and  uncertainty.

### BOX D Policies and Measures (P&Ms):

The note proposes information  exchange on P&Ms and submission of views on the meaning of  demonstrable progress and the need for guidelines for reporting on  this progress, with a view to having further consideration at COP- 7.

### Compliance:

On consequences for non-compliance with Article 3.1  (assigned amounts - AAs), the note suggests that they be agreed in  advance and consist of: subtraction of excess emissions from the  AA of the subsequent commitment period against a penalty rate of  1.5 to 1.75; and submission of a compliance action plan. On  differentation between Annex I and non-Annex I Parties, it is  proposed that: the mandate of the enforcement branch be limited to  commitments incumbent on Annex I  Parties; there are no  eligibility requirements for non-Annex I Parties under the CDM;  and facilitative consequences are not differentiated between these  two groups of Parties.  On the role of the COP/MOP, the note  proposes limiting it to general policy guidance,  and suggests  having no appeals procedure. On the mandate, it proposes that the  enforcement branch covers quantitative commitments and eligibility  under Protocol Articles 6, 12 and 17, and that all other cases  fall within the mandate of the facilitative branch. Moreover, the  facilitative branch would provide advice, facilitate  implementation and promote compliance.

On the composition of the Compliance Committee, both the  facilitative and the enforcement branch would have 11 members  nominated on the basis of the current UNFCCC practice. Under the  enforcement branch, decisions would be adopted by a double  majority - as a whole, and in Annex I and non-Annex I - if there  was no consensus. Finally, the note suggests that the compliance  system be adopted, with legally binding consequences, as an  agreement supplementing the Protocol prior to its entry into  force.

# INFORMAL HIGH-LEVEL PLENARY - NIGHT SESSION

COP-6 President Pronk opened the meeting at 12:30 am Friday. He  recalled that at the earlier meeting, the facilitators had  reported on the ongoing consultations on the 'crunch' issues and  had noted that it was not possible to achieve further results in  the present format of the negotiations. He said he had thus  prepared a note to be used as the basis for further negotiations.  He stressed that although this note drew on the work of the  Parties, it was based on his personal assessment. He stated that  not everyone would be pleased with the note, but reiterated the  need for a balanced approach to the last stage of the  negotiations, which takes into account the interests of all  groups. He said this note represents the compromise needed for a  political decision necessary for ratification, entry into force,  and subsequent implementation of the Protocol. He stated that the  note was not supposed to be the outcome of the negotiating  process, noting that it was no longer possible to aim to complete  the work on all the detailed texts transmitted to the COP by the  subsidiary bodies. He said the political consensus achieved at the  meeting would enable Parties to decide on a method to transform it  into the detailed language of COP-6 decisions, to be adopted at a  later occasion. Noting that Parties would need more time to  consult on the paper, he announced that informal consultations  involving only high-level government officials will continue  throughout Friday and into Saturday. He adjourned the meeting at  1:15 am.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

With President Pronk's new proposal on the table, and his call for  careful reflection before making a judgment still fresh in  delegates' minds, many were cautious in their reactions late  Thursday/early Friday. NGO observers expressed concern at text on  issues such as additional activities and funding, suggesting that  Umbrella Group positions were visible on a number of issues.  However, one participant suggested President Pronk had summed-up  his own proposal quite succinctly earlier in the day when he had  said it attempted to achieve balance and could 'cause pain,' but  would share it as 'fairly as possible.' Another matter under discussion is the clear indication that there  is now only enough time remaining at COP-6 to attempt to reach  agreement on the major political decisions. Some participants are  already speculating when any follow-up meeting to resolve  outstanding issues might take place.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY
