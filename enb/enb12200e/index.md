abstract: "The Sixteenth Sessions of the Subsidiary Bodies (SB-16) to the  1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  (UNFCCC) were held from 5-14 June 2002, at the Maritim Hotel in  Bonn, Germany. Over 1100 participants representing 152 Parties,  one observer State, 112 observer organizations and four media  outlets were in attendance. Having completed three years of  negotiations on the operational details of the Kyoto Protocol in  November 2001, delegates met in Bonn for a new phase of  negotiations, focusing on the implementation of the Marrakesh  Accords to the Bonn Agreements, and on issues under the UNFCCC."

What became apparent at SB-16 is just how different Parties' views  are on what direction the climate process should take. The meeting  was haunted by contradictory stances on the focus and intent of  this and future negotiations. Some Parties wanted to keep the  focus firmly on the present, tackling short-term technical tasks  while essentially maintaining a holding pattern until entry into  force of the Protocol and the generation of further political  momentum. Other Parties seemed to have their sights set on the  future and the need to start discussing long-term objectives and  future commitments - an approach that met with stern resistance in  some quarters. Still others were arguably more focused on the  recent past and their hopes to continue debates from Marrakesh by  securing terms that would make ratification more politically  palatable. This crisis of identity is likely to carry through to  the eighth Conference of the Parties in New Dehli in October 2002.

# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  human health and well-being, the global economy, and the  sustainability of the world's environment. Mainstream scientists  agree that the Earth's climate is affected by the anthropogenic  emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Despite  some lingering uncertainties, a majority of scientists believe  that prompt, precautionary action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change took shape  with the negotiation of the UNFCCC. Adopted in 1992, the UNFCCC  sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid 'dangerous  interference' with the climate system. The UNFCCC entered into  force on 21 March 1994. It now has 186 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, whose task was to reach agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  to achieve quantified emissions targets. These countries, known  under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to  reducing their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at  least 5% below 1990 levels over the period 2008 and 2012 (the  first commitment period), with specific targets varying from  country to country. The Protocol also established three mechanisms  to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost- effectively - an emissions trading system, joint implementation  (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties, and  a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to encourage projects in non- Annex I (developing country) Parties.

It was left for subsequent meetings to decide on most of the rules  and operational details that determine how these cuts in emissions  will be achieved and how countries' efforts will be measured and  assessed. To enter into force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55  Parties to the UNFCCC, including Annex I Parties representing at  least 55% of the total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990. To date,  74 Parties have ratified the Protocol, including 21 Annex I  Parties, representing a total of 35.8% of carbon dioxide  emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

At COP-4, which met in Buenos  Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, Parties set a schedule for  reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and  for strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC itself. In a  decision known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA),  delegates agreed that the deadline for reaching agreement should  be COP-6. Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution  included rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing  Parties' compliance, and accounting methods for national emissions  and emissions reductions. Rules on crediting countries for carbon  sinks were also to be addressed. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the  adverse effects of climate change or to actions taken by  industrialized countries to combat climate change.

Numerous formal and informal meetings and consultations were held  during 1999 and 2000 to help lay the foundations for an agreement  at COP-6. However, as COP-6 drew closer, political positions on  the key issues remained entrenched, with little indication of a  willingness to compromise.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the  Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000. During the second week of  negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk, Minister of Housing,  Spatial Planning and Environment of the Netherlands, attempted to  facilitate progress on the many disputed political and technical  issues by convening high-level informal plenary sessions.

However, by Thursday, 23 November, negotiations remained stalled,  and Pronk distributed a Note containing his proposal on key issues  in an attempt to encourage a breakthrough. After almost 36 hours  of intense talks, negotiators could not achieve an agreement, with  financial issues, supplementarity in the use of the mechanisms,  compliance and land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)  proving particularly difficult. On Saturday afternoon, 25  November, Pronk announced that delegates had failed to reach  agreement. Parties agreed to suspend COP-6, and expressed a  willingness to resume their work in 2001.

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP-6 PART II

A number of meetings and  consultations were convened after COP-6 Part I in an effort to get  negotiations back on track. In late June 2001, Pronk presented a  consolidated negotiating text to help delegates reach a  compromise. However, while some participants expressed the opinion  that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6 Part I,  others suggested that positions had possibly widened on issues  such as LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and funding.

In addition to official preparations for COP-6 Part II, there were  a number of political developments following the meeting in The  Hague. In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  Protocol, stating that it considered the Protocol to be 'fatally  flawed,' as it would damage the US economy and would not require  developing countries to meet emissions targets.

### COP-6 PART II

COP-6 Part II and the fourteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies met in Bonn, Germany, from 16-27 July  2001. From 16-18 July, delegates met in closed negotiating groups  to settle differences on key texts. On 19 July, the high-level  segment began, with participants striving to achieve a 'political'  decision on key outstanding issues. After protracted  consultations, Pronk presented his proposal for a draft political  decision outlining agreement on core elements of the BAPA.  However, in spite of several Parties announcing that they could  support the political decision, disagreements surfaced over the  section on compliance. After several further days of  consultations, ministers finally agreed to adopt the original  political decision, with a revised section on compliance. The  political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - was formally adopted  by the COP on 25 July 2001.

Although draft decisions were approved on several key issues,  delegates were unable to remove all brackets in text on the  mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF. Since not all texts in the  'package' of decisions were completed, all draft decisions were  forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates met for COP-7 and the fifteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October  - 10 November 2001. The main goal was to complete tasks left  unfinished at COP-6 Parts I and II, thereby bringing to a close  three years of negotiations. The Bonn Agreements served as the  basis for delegates striving to finish their work.

From 30 October to 6 November delegates met in negotiating groups,  closed drafting groups and informal consultations in an attempt to  resolve outstanding issues relating to the mechanisms, compliance,  accounting, reporting and review under Articles 5, 7and 8, and  LULUCF. Ongoing negotiations were also held on draft COP decisions  relating to least developed countries (LDCs), the Consultative  Group of Experts on non-Annex I National Communications (CGE), and  input to the WSSD.

On Wednesday, 7 November, COP-7's high-level segment began, with  ministers and senior officials seeking to bring negotiations to a  successful conclusion. After protracted bilateral and multilateral  talks, a package deal on LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5,  7 and 8, and input to the WSSD was proposed on Thursday evening, 8  November. Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups,  including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose  alliance of Annex I Parties that includes Canada, Australia,  Japan, the Russian Federation, and New Zealand) did not join the  consensus, with key areas of dispute including eligibility  requirements and bankability under the mechanisms. However,  following extensive negotiations, a package deal was agreed, with  key features including consideration of LULUCF Principles and  limited banking of units generated by sinks under the CDM.

### RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Since COP-7, 34 additional Parties have  ratified the Protocol. This includes Japan and the fifteen member  States of the European Union, which recently delivered their  instruments of ratification to the UN. Several other Parties have  also started the process of ratification and are expected to  complete this procedure in time for the World Summit on  Sustainable Development (WSSD) in August.

On 17 January, Joke Waller-Hunter (Netherlands) was named the new  Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, while Rajendra K. Pachauri  (India) was recently named the new Chair of the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

# SB-16 REPORT

The Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice  (SBSTA) met from 5-14 June 2002. Parties convened in plenary  meetings, contact groups, and informal consultations to consider  various technical and methodological issues. As a result of these  meetings, draft conclusions were adopted on a number of issues,  including: the IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR); guidelines on  reporting and review of greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I  Parties; Protocol Articles 5 (methodological issues), 7  (communication of information), and 8 (review of information);  activities implemented jointly (AIJ); development of good practice  guidance for LULUCF; LULUCF under the CDM; technology transfer;  the relationship between efforts to protect the ozone layer and  climate change; policies and measures (P&Ms); cooperation with  relevant international organizations; and UNFCCC Article 6  (education, training and public awareness). In addition,  participants agreed on text for conclusions on the implementation  of Protocol Article 2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms), issues related  to cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, and a proposal  on the special circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6  (flexibility for economies in transition).

The Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) met from 10-14 June.  Delegates to the SBI adopted conclusions on: national  communications; the financial mechanism; implementation of UNFCCC  Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse effects); the Least Developed  Countries Expert Group (LEG); capacity building; arrangements for  intergovernmental meetings; and administrative and financial  matters. Parties also considered preparations for the World Summit  on Sustainable Development (WSSD).

A request from countries of Central Asia, the Caucasus, Albania  and Moldova (CACAM) and a proposal by Croatia on LULUCF were  forwarded to SB-17.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

SBSTA Chair Halldór Thorgeirsson (Iceland) opened the first  meeting of SBSTA's sixteenth session on Wednesday, 5 June, noting  that the focus of work has shifted from negotiations on the  Protocol to issues of implementation. UNFCCC Executive Secretary  Joke Waller-Hunter said that a total of 74 Parties have now  ratified the Protocol, representing 35.8% of industrialized  countries' total greenhouse gas emissions.

Japan and the EU drew attention to their recent ratifications, and  encouraged other Parties to follow suit. Venezuela, on behalf of  the G-77/China, said that the recent focus on the Protocol has  meant some UNFCCC issues have been neglected, particularly those  relevant to developing countries. The Russian Federation stated  that its national consultations on ratifying the Protocol should  be completed by the end of the year.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

At the opening session, delegates took up  the adoption of the agenda (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/1 and Add.1). Chair  Thorgeirsson noted a request to add an item on Protocol Article  2.3 (adverse effects of P&Ms) to the agendas of both subsidiary  bodies. The EU recalled that COP-7 decision 5/CP.7 on adverse  effects also addresses Article 2.3, and questioned whether the  proposed item was necessary. Saudi Arabia said Parties had agreed  that decisions on Protocol and UNFCCC issues would be kept  separate. With the support of the G-77/China, but opposed by the  EU, Japan, and Australia, he supported inserting this item on the  agenda.

On a proposal by Canada on cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting  energy, the G-77/China said the item was incorrectly worded on the  provisional agenda, and that it should refer to the report of the  workshop on this issue, not to a proposal. Canada said the  provisional agenda correctly referred to a proposal and, supported  by several Annex I Parties and Uzbekistan, but opposed by Saudi  Arabia, stressed retaining the issue as worded in the provisional  agenda.

Following consultations, Parties agreed with the Chair's proposal  that the agenda items on clean energy and on Article 2.3 be held  in abeyance. Chair Thorgeirsson said further consultations would  be carried out on the agenda.

On Tuesday, 11 June, Chair Thorgeirsson said consultations had  taken place on this matter, and invited delegates to adopt the  agenda, including amended items on issues related to cleaner or  less greenhouse gas-emitting energy and on issues related to the  implementation of Protocol Article 2.3. He said the latter issue  would not appear on the SBI agenda. Delegates adopted the agenda.

### IPCC TAR

The Third Assessment Report (TAR) of the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) was taken up by the SBSTA on Wednesday, 5  June, and subsequently addressed in a contact group co-chaired by  David Warrilow (UK) and Rawleston Moore (Barbados). After numerous  negotiations in both the contact group and informal consultations  held from 6-14 June, delegates were able to reach agreement on  text for draft conclusions, which the SBSTA adopted on Friday  afternoon, 14 June.

At the SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday, 5 June, IPCC Chair Rajendra K.  Pachauri made a presentation on the TAR, inviting Parties to make  full use of the information it contains, and noting that work on  the fourth assessment report should be completed in 2007. Many  Parties emphasized the importance of disseminating the TAR's  findings. China, Saudi Arabia and Algeria supported additional  work on the historical responsibility for climate change and on  equity issues. The EU, Switzerland and Slovenia said information  contained in the TAR justified further action on climate change,  and Norway supported discussions on stronger emissions reductions  and broader participation beyond 2012, suggesting that SBSTA  launch a process to strengthen commitments. Saudi Arabia said a  dangerous level of greenhouse gases could not be determined given  scientific uncertainties. Chair Thorgeirsson indicated that a  contact group would convene to develop draft conclusions on the  issue.

At the first contact group meeting on Thursday, 6 June, Co-Chair  Warrilow asked Parties to focus on how the IPCC TAR can assist the  work of SBSTA and other UNFCCC bodies. Delegates began by  discussing issues raised in SBSTA the previous day, including  regional impacts and adaptation, UNFCCC Article 6, research,  observations, and scientific uncertainty. The following evening,  delegates discussed draft conclusions, continuing their  deliberations on Saturday morning, and basing their discussions on  a Co-Chairs' list of issues raised by Parties, which included  financial matters, the Protocol, adaptation, science and  organizing principles.

On Monday, 10 June, Co-Chair Moore introduced updated draft  conclusions. Parties discussed the text paragraph by paragraph,  continuing their work the following day. Differing views were  expressed on various parts of the text, including on language used  in a paragraph noting that the TAR provides information that has  long-term relevance to the UNFCCC's ultimate objective, as defined  in Article 2. In this regard, Malaysia, on behalf of the G-77/China, proposed deleting a sentence on the need to explore the  balance between mitigation and adaptation, while China and Saudi  Arabia suggested removing the entire paragraph. Canada, the EU,  Norway, Japan, Russian Federation and New Zealand favored  retaining it in some form, and discussions continued late into the  night.

Informal consultations were held on Wednesday, 12 June, and the  contact group reconvened in the evening to consider a revised  text. The paragraph on the TAR's relevance to the objective of the  UNFCCC was amended to refer to 'general' rather than 'long-term'  relevance, and the specific reference to 'Article 2' was removed.

On Thursday, 13 June, Co-Chair Warrilow briefed the SBSTA Plenary  on the discussions, noting 'excellent' progress in six open  meetings and two closed informal consultations. However, some  paragraphs remained bracketed, and Parties were unable to agree on  the text as it stood, with Saudi Arabia objecting to the process  adopted in the contact group.

After further protracted informal negotiations, Parties approved  the draft conclusions, which SBSTA then adopted on Friday  afternoon. Following its adoption, New Zealand expressed  disappointment at the 'weak' final text, particularly the deletion  of a paragraph that would have agreed to an initial exchange of  views at SBSTA-17. Chair Thorgeirsson noted that a consensus  process was not easy, and suggested that the success of this text  would depend on how much 'conceptual investment' was put into it.

###     SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on the TAR  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.3/Rev.1) note the three broad areas -  scientific basis, impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and  mitigation - covered by the TAR, and agree that 'in general it  should be used routinely' for informing the deliberations of the  COP and its subsidiary bodies. The conclusions identify three  preliminary areas that the SBSTA could regularly consider:research and systematic observation, including the need for  enhanced interaction with international research programmes, and  for more research on greenhouse gas atmospheric concentration and  forcing agents; scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of impacts  of, and vulnerability and adaptation to, climate change; and, scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects of  mitigation.

The conclusions note that the TAR synthesis report covers the  broad aspects of the TAR and wider cross-cutting issues of general  relevance to Parties. They also note significant progress in the  TAR compared to the Second Assessment Report in addressing  scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects related to the  UNFCCC's 'ultimate objective, principles, and general provisions.'  They add, however, that many uncertainties exist and that further  research is required, observing that there are 'a wide range of  opinions' on issues pertaining to the UNFCCC's objective and  provisions.

The conclusions also: request the Secretariat to invite various  research bodies to address SBSTA-17 on research recommendations in  the TAR; invite Parties to submit their views on priorities for  research by 20 August 2002; and invite Parties to submit views on  issues covered in these conclusions and on aspects of the TAR  relevant to the COP and its subsidiary bodies by 31 January 2003,  for consideration at SBSTA-18.

## METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES

### GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING AND REVIEW OF GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES  FROM ANNEX I PARTIES

The agenda item on reporting and review of  greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I Parties was first  addressed in SBSTA on Wednesday, 5 June. It was then taken up in a  contact group co-chaired by Audun Rosland (Norway) and Newton  Paciornik (Brazil). On Tuesday, 11 June, the group completed its  work on draft conclusions, which were adopted by SBSTA on  Thursday, 13 June.

On Wednesday, 5 June, the Secretariat presented SBSTA with an  overview of relevant recommendations and experiences of the  technical review process (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/5; FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2).  He said the review process aimed to establish more complete and  transparent guidelines and highlighted the need to: improve  guidelines through a common reporting format; better define draft  report objectives; incorporate a new concept of literature  reviewers; and consider timing and length of the review process. A  contact group was formed to consider these issues.

The contact group met on Thursday, 6 June, to consider a Co- Chairs' proposed draft working paper and annex  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.1-3), which incorporated EU and US  technical proposals on the guidelines. Agreement was reached on  text relating to key source category determination, quality  assurance/quality control and recalculations.

On Friday, 7 June, Parties reconvened in the contact group to hear  the Co-Chairs' revisions of text on reporting guidelines, the  common reporting format (CRF) tables, and pending issues held over  from Thursday. On uncertainties for reporting, Canada said these  should be quantified and reported, but not in the CRF, which  compares data across Parties. Peru recommended the inclusion of  uncertainties, while the US said uncertainties should fall under  national inventory reporting (NIR). China opposed a US proposal  that CRF tables contain key source categories, proposing that  uncertainties cover all categories. Co-Chair Rosland invited  Parties to reach conclusions on pending issues by Saturday  morning. A sub-group met in the evening to consider the CRF tables  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.3), with differences again resurfacing on  uncertainties for key sources.

On Saturday, 8 June, discussion focused on the proposed structure  of NIR, on when to use 'shall' or 'should' in the guidelines, and  on how the guidelines will apply to Parties that choose 1995 as  their baseline under Protocol Article 3.8 (base year for HFCs,  PFCs, and SF6).

On Monday, 10 June, the contact group met in afternoon and evening  sessions, with delegates considering methodological issues  addressed in the report of an expert meeting to assess experience  of the use of the reporting and review guidelines  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.1).

In the evening, Co-Chair Rosland reported that technical  consultations had resolved several outstanding issues, such as  source categories, and the CRF tables. Parties then revisited the  reporting guidelines and the methodological annex, with  consultations continuing late into the night.

On Tuesday, 11 June, the contact group completed its work. Parties  agreed to revisions to the draft working paper by the Co-Chairs,  including on: issues under the general approach; scope of the  initial check of annual inventories; synthesis and assessment  report; timing; and review of individual annual inventories.

On Thursday, 13 June, Co-Chair Paciornik introduced the draft  conclusions to the SBSTA, which adopted them without amendment.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.5), the  SBSTA decides to recommend to the COP two draft decisions on  revisions to the guidelines for the preparation of Annex I  national communications, including UNFCCC reporting guidelines on  annual inventories (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.5/Add.1) and revisions to  the UNFCCC guidelines for the technical review of Annex I  greenhouse gas inventories under the Convention  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.5/Add.2).

The conclusions also:urge Annex I Parties that have not submitted complete  inventories, including national inventory reports and common  reporting formats, to do so as soon as possible; urge Parties to ensure that experts are made available for  the review process from 2003; urge the Secretariat, subject to availability of funding in  the current biennium, to supplement funding for the development of  a greenhouse gas inventory database, related software and website;  and note the need to ensure expertise of experts in the review  teams, and decide to consider the treatment of confidential data,  jointly with similar items under Protocol Article 8 (review of  information) (decision 23/CP.7) at SBSTA-17.

### GUIDELINES UNDER PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7, AND 8

Delegates to  SBSTA-16 considered issues related to the guidelines under  Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8 in a plenary session on Wednesday, 5  June, before taking up the matter in a contact group chaired by  Helen Plume (New Zealand) and Festus Luboyera (South Africa). The  contact group met seven times, developing draft conclusions that  were adopted by the SBSTA on Thursday, 13 June.

At the opening SBSTA Plenary on Wednesday, 5 June, Chair  Thorgeirsson highlighted issues to be covered by SBSTA-16 relating  to Articles 5, 7 and 8 relating to: sections of the guidelines  under Articles 7 and 8 that were not concluded during COP-7,  including reporting and review of assigned amounts and national  registries, and procedures for expedited review for the  reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms; technical  aspects of review of demonstrable progress; and the treatment of  confidential information. Audun Rosland (Norway) reported on a  workshop on adjustments under Article 5.2, and Murray Ward (New  Zealand) reported on intersessional consultations on technical  standards for registries under Article 7.4. The issue was then  referred to a contact group.

On Thursday, 6 June, the contact group began discussing the review  for reinstatement of mechanisms' eligibility, and continued to do  so during several subsequent meetings. A small drafting group was  also convened to focus on, inter alia, the review timeframe.

On Saturday, 8 June, Brazil, on behalf of the G-77/China, stressed  links between work on the pending parts of Articles 7 and 8 and  outcomes from the group on LULUCF under the CDM. A draft COP-8  decision on demonstrable progress under Article 3.2 was then  considered. The G-77/China and the Alliance of Small Island States  (AOSIS) stressed concern about evaluating progress. Delegates  agreed to text proposed by the G-77/China requesting Parties to  report on progress incorporating work under P&Ms.

On the draft conclusions, which were discussed on Wednesday, 12  June, the G-77/China suggested adding a new paragraph stating that  SBSTA agrees to further elaborate the pending parts of the  guidelines following the result of the process of developing  definitions and modalities for including LULUCF under the CDM.  After protracted discussions, Parties arrived at a compromise for  considering at a later stage the implications, if any, of the work  on LULUCF under the CDM on the pending parts of the guidelines.  The SBSTA adopted the conclusions on Thursday, 13 June.

###     SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on guidelines under Protocol  Articles 5, 7, and 8 (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.6 and Add.1):forward a draft COP-8 decision on how information on  demonstrable progress under Protocol Article 2.3 shall be  presented and evaluated; forward a second draft decision on the expedited review for  reinstatement of eligibility to use the mechanisms, included as an  annex, for agreement on timing at SBSTA-17; agree to continue work on the pending parts of the Article 7  and 8 guidelines with a view to adopting them by COP-8, and invite  Parties to submit views on them by 1 August; agree that the implication, if any, of work on LULUCF under  the CDM may be necessary to consider; and take note of work on adjustments under Article 5.2,  requesting the Secretariat to prepare case studies and organize a  workshop on this issue and Parties to submit views and undertake  work on methodologies for adjustments.

The conclusions also decide to aim at completing the technical  guidance on the methodologies for consideration by COP-9. They  take note of a technical paper on the treatment of confidential  information, remind Parties to submit views on training of Expert  Review Team (ERT) members, and take note of ongoing work on  technical standards for registries.

### ACTIVITIES IMPLEMENTED JOINTLY (AIJ)

The issue of activities  implemented jointly (AIJ) under the pilot phase was taken up by  the SBSTA on Wednesday, 5 June, and subsequently addressed in a  contact group co-chaired by Mamadou Honadia (Burkina Faso) and  Sushma Gera (Canada). The contact group met twice formally and  once informally, approving draft conclusions that include an  addendum containing a draft COP-8 decision and an agreed revised  uniform reporting format (URF) for AIJ under the pilot phase. The  conclusions were adopted by the SBSTA on Thursday, 13 June.

On Wednesday, 5 June, Chair Thorgeirsson noted COP-7 decision  8/CP.7 to continue the pilot phase and hold a workshop on the  draft revised URF prior to SB-16 (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.9).  Participants were then briefed on the workshop, which took place  in Bonn from 2-3 June, and on other relevant documents, including  a compilation of Parties' submissions on their experiences with  the pilot phase (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.2). Kenya, on behalf of the  G-77/China, said the geographic distribution of projects should be  improved, particularly for Africa. A contact group was formed to  consider the matter further.

Later that day, the group convened to examine the draft revised  URF (FCCC/SB/2000/6/Add.1) and approve a number of proposals on  several sections of the draft. The group completed its work on  Friday, 7 June, agreeing to several amendments to the sections on  summarizing the AIJ project and on financing, and approving the  draft annexes. Following informal consultations, participants  adopted the section on mutually agreed assessment procedures, and  inserted a sentence in the chapeau clarifying that the content  provided using the revised URF is 'for information purposes only  and should not be construed as adopting the underlying concepts.'  Parties concluded their work by approving draft conclusions for  consideration by the SBSTA, as well as a draft COP-8 decision. The  conclusions, including the addendum containing the draft decision  and revised URF, were adopted by the SBSTA on Thursday, 13 June.

###     SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on AIJ (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.2)  recommend a draft COP-8 decision and agree on a revised URF, both  of which are contained in FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.2/Add.1. The draft  decision adopts the revised URF and urges Parties involved in AIJ  to use it.

### GOOD PRACTICE GUIDANCE AND OTHER INFORMATION FOR LULUCF

The  development of good practice guidance for LULUCF was addressed on  Thursday, 6 June. The IPCC reported on its LULUCF work programme,  noting a recent task force meeting and its work plan for the  upcoming year. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) gave  conclusions from an expert meeting held in January 2002 on  harmonizing forest-related definitions for use by various  stakeholders, and which had been jointly organized with the IPCC,  the Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR), and the  International Union for Forest Research Organizations (IUFRO). He  highlighted the meeting's recommendations that: universally- accepted definitions should be considered; existing definitions  should be approved and adopted before new ones are created; FAO's  current definitions are generally compatible with Protocol Article  3.3 and 3.4 (LULUCF); and definitions are incompatible with some  land uses or the state of forests. Chair Thorgeirsson said he  would prepare draft conclusions on this item, in consultation with  interested Parties. The draft conclusions were adopted, without  amendment, by the SBSTA Plenary on Thursday, 13 June.

###     SBSTA Conclusions:

The draft conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.2):  welcome the progress made by the IPCC in the development of LULUCF  good practice guidance and highlight the importance of timely  completion of this work by COP-9; and encourage the IPCC to  continue its work with the FAO, and take into consideration input  from this process when developing definitions for forest  degradation and devegetation of other vegetation types.

### LULUCF UNDER THE CDM

SBSTA-16 considered this agenda item in a  plenary session on Thursday, 6 June, referring the matter to a  contact group co-chaired by Karsten Sach (Germany) and Thelma Krug  (Brazil). The contact group met four times, developing draft  conclusions that were adopted by the SBSTA on 13 June.

On Thursday, 6 June, Chair Thorgeirsson informed the SBSTA that  COP-7 had requested it to develop, for adoption at COP-9,  definitions and modalities for including afforestation and  reforestation activities under the CDM in the first commitment  period, considering: non-permanence; additionality; leakage;  uncertainties; socioeconomic and environmental impacts; and the  Principles guiding LULUCF, as agreed in the Marrakesh Accords. The  Secretariat highlighted a workshop held from 7-9 April in Orvieto,  Italy, which had drafted TOR and a work agenda for LULUCF under  the CDM. The EU supported basing definitions on those agreed for  Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4 (LULUCF). The item was referred to a  contact group.

The group met later in the day to consider the draft TOR. Brazil,  speaking for the G-77/China, stressed that the draft TOR and work  agenda from the workshop served as a basis for negotiation only,  and China called for further exchange of views. The EU, Canada,  Japan, Uruguay, Costa Rica and New Zealand preferred using the TOR  and work agenda as they stand, stressing the tight work schedule.  Parties engaged in an initial exchange of views on the work  programme. The G-77/China stressed the relevance of the LULUCF  guiding Principles, particularly on non-permanence. Brazil  underscored links between Articles 5, 7 and 8 and LULUCF under the  CDM.

In afternoon and evening sessions held on Friday, 7 June, Co-Chair  Sach introduced a revised TOR and work agenda. Participants  debated how to consider accounting, reporting and review aspects  when developing definitions and modalities for including LULUCF  under the CDM, as proposed by the G-77/China. Canada cautioned  against moving beyond the group's mandate.

The G-77/China suggested compiling a paper on different options  for addressing modalities for accounting, reporting and review  aspects, while the EU, Canada and Japan preferred integrating  these issues into the other options papers. In the work agenda,  China proposed moving up deadlines to allow more time for  preparation and Malaysia stressed the need for exchange of views  before developing modalities.

On Saturday, 8 June, Parties agreed on the draft TOR and work  agenda. On definitions, Parties exchanged views on a Canadian  proposal to change the baseline year under definitions of  'reforestation' from 1989 to 1999, but did not reach agreement.

Delegates adopted conclusions at the SBSTA Plenary on Thursday, 13  June. Tuvalu expressed disappointment at SBSTA's failure to agree  on the definitions on afforestation and reforestation, noting that  these definitions had been adopted in COP-7 decision 11/CP.7. He  stated that if the decision is reopened, he would introduce new  definitions under Protocol Article 3.3 and 3.4.

###     SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on LULUCF under the CDM  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.8) take note with appreciation of the workshop  on LULUCF under the CDM held prior to the session, agree on the  TOR and work programme (contained in an annex to these  conclusions), and agree to continue its work regarding definitions  and modalities for including LULUCF under the CDM.

## TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

The agenda item on development and transfer of technologies was  taken up by the SBSTA on Thursday, 6 June, and again on Tuesday,  11 June. Following informal consultations co-chaired by Terry  Carrington (UK) and Philip Gwage (Uganda), Parties adopted draft  conclusions in the SBSTA Plenary on Thursday, 13 June.

On Thursday, 6 June, SBSTA Chair Thorgeirsson drew attention to a  number of relevant reports on technology transfer  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.12, FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.6, and INF.7), and  invited Jukka Uosukainen (Finland), Chair of the UNFCCC Expert  Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT), to brief delegates on the  Group's activities since its establishment by COP-7 decision  4/CP.7. EGTT Chair Uosukainen noted that a preliminary meeting had  taken place in April, followed by the first formal meeting on 3  June. EGTT Vice Chair William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu (Ghana) reported  to SBSTA on Tuesday, 11 June, on the second formal EGTT meeting,  which took place on 8 June, and introduced a proposed EGTT work  programme for 2002-03. These matters were then taken up in  informal consultations.

On Thursday, 13 June, Carrington briefed the SBSTA Plenary on  these consultations, noting that agreement had been reached on  text for relevant draft conclusions, and that discussions on the  EGTT had resulted in several modifications to the work programme,  which would be annexed to the draft conclusions. Parties adopted  the conclusions.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on technology transfer  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.9) note with appreciation the reports on two  recent workshops held in Beijing and Seoul. They adopt the EGTT's  2002-2003 work programme, as contained in an annex, ask the EGTT  to take into account Parties' views and relevant IPCC reports in  implementing its work, and request a brief progress report at  SBSTA-17. The conclusions also ask the Global Environment Facility  (GEF), through the SBI, to provide information to SBSTA-18 on the  status of financial support. They conclude with a request to the  Secretariat to: initiate an outreach programme to make the  technology information system available to the public; update and  maintain the system; assess the system's effectiveness and report  on it at SBSTA-19; and cooperate with the GEF, UNDP, and other  relevant organizations and initiatives to develop a simplified  handbook on methodologies for technology needs assessments, and  report on this at SBSTA-18.

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OZONE AND CLIMATE EFFORTS

Delegates considered this agenda item in the SBSTA Plenary on  Friday, 7 June. Chair Thorgeirsson recalled COP-5 decision 17/CP.5  requesting information on available and potential ways and means  of limiting emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and  perfluorocarbons (PFCs), including their use as replacements for  ozone-depleting substances. On Thursday, 13 June, Richard Bradley  (US), briefed the SBSTA Plenary on informal consultations he had  conducted on the topic, noting agreement on the value of a  balanced information package and a process for recommending a  draft COP-8 decision at SB-17. He informed the SBSTA that  agreement had been reached, with the exception of a G-77/China  proposal to amend three references in the text to relate  specifically to 'Annex I' Parties. Following further informal  consultations on this proposal, a compromise was reached and SBSTA  adopted amended draft conclusions.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on the relationship between  ozone and climate efforts (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.12), inter alia, take  note of submissions on the relationship between ozone and climate  efforts, note the importance of developing a balanced scientific,  technical and policy-relevant information package in this regard,  and invite the IPCC and the Technology and Economic Assessment  Panel of the Montreal Protocol to provide guidance on providing  such a package.

## 'GOOD PRACTICES' IN POLICIES AND MEASURES

The issue of 'good practices' in policies and measures (P&Ms) was  taken up by the SBSTA on Thursday, 6 June, and subsequently  addressed in a contact group co-chaired by Pierre Giroux (Canada)  and Suk-Hoon Woo (Republic of Korea). The contact group met four  times from 7-12 June to develop draft conclusions, which were  adopted by SBSTA on Thursday, 13 June.

On Thursday, 6 June, Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the agenda item  to the SBSTA Plenary, highlighting COP-7 decision 13/CP.7, which  called on SBSTA-16 to consider further action to advance work on  'good practices' in P&Ms, as well as the report of a workshop on  P&Ms held in October 2001 (FCCC/SBSTA/2001/INF.5). He also drew  attention to Parties' recent submissions on possible further  actions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.7). Several Parties highlighted the  importance of national circumstances in determining appropriate  P&Ms. The EU called for a work programme to ensure proper  implementation of Protocol Article 2.1(b) (cooperation on P&Ms),  and Saudi Arabia, on behalf of the G-77/China, highlighted the  need to minimize the impact of Annex I Parties' P&Ms on developing  countries. A contact group was formed to consider the matter  further.

The contact group met on Friday night, 7 June. Co-Chair Giroux  asked for input on how to move forward on implementing the COP-7  decision. Several Parties emphasized the value of exchanging  information and sharing experiences. Australia and the US  supported a stock-taking exercise to review available information,  including from recent workshops, while AOSIS endorsed continuing  information exchange, an examination of policy formulation  processes, and sectoral analysis.

The following afternoon, Co-Chairs Woo and Giroux introduced a  one-page document containing a table reflecting issues raised the  previous night. The table included headings on consideration of  initial results from actions taken under the COP-7 decision, and  on a framework for action. Parties made suggestions for amendments  or additions to the table, and Co-Chair Giroux said draft  conclusions would be developed based on these comments.

The group reconvened on Tuesday, 11 June, to consider the Co- Chairs' draft conclusions. Stressing that good practice in P&Ms  applies to Annex I Parties, the G-77/China proposed inserting  reference to this in appropriate parts of the text. On text  agreeing on a 'frame for action' to consider further steps to  advance work on P&Ms, the US proposed limiting the reference to  considering further steps 'in implementing decision 13/CP.7.' The  EU, Samoa, New Zealand, Australia and Japan preferred the original  broader formulation, or variations on this formulation.

At a final meeting on 12 June, the group considered a further  revision of the text. Parties agreed on compromise language on  further steps, retaining reference to a 'frame for action' that  was supported by the EU and others, and deleting the notion of  'in-depth' information-sharing as an element of this frame, as  requested by the US.

On Thursday, 13 June, Co-Chair Giroux reported to the SBSTA that  the contact group had reached agreement on the draft conclusions,  with the exception of a paragraph proposed by the G-77/China on  principles. Following further consultations, a compromise was  reached. The draft conclusions were adopted that evening, as  amended.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on P&Ms (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.10)  request the SBSTA Chair to organize intersessional consultations  back-to-back with SBSTA-17 to exchange views on the initial  results from activities undertaken on 'good and best practices' in  P&Ms. They agree on a frame for defining Annex I Parties' further  steps in implementing decision 13/CP.7. The frame will include  three elements: general information sharing; information sharing  in specific areas encompassing all relevant sectors and cross- cutting and methodological issues; and information from relevant  international and intergovernmental organizations.

The conclusions also invite relevant organizations, including the  IPCC, to present status reports at SBSTA-17 and future sessions.  Finally, they invite Parties to submit views on elements for  consideration of initial results and the 'frame' for defining  further steps, and agree to consider further steps at SBSTA-17.

## COOPERATION WITH INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS

The agenda item on cooperation with relevant international  organizations included three sub-items on scientific  organizations, UN bodies, and other conventions. The SBSTA Plenary  addressed cooperation with scientific organizations and UN bodies  on Thursday, 6 June, and informal consultations began that day. On  7 June, the SBSTA took up the sub-item on cooperation with other  conventions.

On Thursday, 13 June, the SBSTA adopted conclusions on cooperation  with scientific organizations and on other conventions, without  amendment, and discussed the draft conclusions on cooperation with  UN bodies, ultimately deferring their adoption, with amendments,  to Friday, 14 June.

### COOPERATION WITH SCIENTIFIC ORGANIZATIONS

At the SBSTA meeting on  Thursday, 6 June, Parties concurred on the importance of  implementing the climate monitoring principles adopted at COP-5.  An informal contact group, co-chaired by Sue Barrell (Australia)  and David Lesolle (Botswana), was convened in the afternoon.  Following discussions on capacity building needs, the Co-Chairs  adjourned the meeting to prepare a draft decision on guidance to  Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Further informal  discussions took place behind closed doors. Conclusions were  adopted on Thursday 13, June, without amendment.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions on cooperation with scientific  organizations (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.3) note the urgency of  implementing action plans developed from regional workshops, and  urge Annex I Parties to contribute support for addressing priority  areas of concern relating to global monitoring systems.

### COOPERATION WITH UN BODIES

In SBSTA Plenary on Friday, 7 June,  the EU, Switzerland, Tuvalu, and Norway proposed inviting the  Secretariat to explore methodological issues relating to emissions  from international transport, and report results to SB-17. This  proposal was opposed by Australia, the US and Saudi Arabia. Chair  Thorgeirsson said he would prepare draft conclusions on  cooperation with UN bodies.

Conclusions were presented to the SBSTA Plenary on Thursday, 13  June; however, Parties were unable to agree on the timeframe for  consideration of methodological issues relating to emissions from  international transport. Following further consultations, amended  conclusions on this issue were adopted Friday, 14 June.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.4/Rev.1)  decide that the SBSTA will consider methodological aspects related  to emissions from international transport at SB-18.

### COOPERATION WITH OTHER CONVENTIONS

This matter was addressed  briefly by SBSTA on Thursday, 6 June, before being taken up in  informal closed consultations co-chaired by Clare Breidenich (US)  and Yvette Munguia de Aguilar (El Salvador). The conclusions were  adopted on Thursday, 13 June.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

SBSTA conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.4)  reconfirm the mandate of the Joint Liaison Group of the UNFCCC,  the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN  Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and agree to  consider cross-cutting thematic areas under the UNFCCC, CBD, and  the UNCCD at SB-17, with a view to recommending Terms of Reference  for a workshop.

## ARTICLE 6

UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and public awareness) was  addressed by the SBSTA Plenary on Friday, 7 June, and subsequently  in a contact group co-chaired by Jean-Pascal van Ypersele  (Belgium) and S. N. Sok Appadu (Mauritius). Conclusions, which  take note of a bracketed draft decision for consideration at COP- 8, were adopted by SBSTA on Thursday, 13 June, with amendments.

At the SBSTA Plenary on Friday, 7 June, Parties discussed the  report from a recent workshop to develop a work programme on  Article 6 activities (FCCC/SBSTA/ 2002/INF.10). Malaysia, Senegal,  Namibia, Brazil and Eritrea underscored the need for Article 6  activities to be country-driven.

At the contact group's first meeting, held Friday afternoon,  Parties suggested key words/concepts to guide the Co-Chairs' work  in clarifying a draft work programme. They also discussed the  objectives of the work programme, and its potential priorities.

At the second meeting of the contact group, held on Monday, 10  June, Canada argued for postponing debate on the proposed draft  decision on an Article 6 work programme until SB-17 to give  Parties sufficient time to assess its potential implications. A  representative of the GEF urged careful consideration of language  regarding financial resources. Consultations continued late into  the night.

On Wednesday, 12 June, the contact group agreed insufficient time  remained to discuss the draft decision, and engaged in paragraph- by-paragraph discussions on the draft conclusions only. Parties  could not agree on the need for a work programme that would take  into account the 'availability of financial resources' and/or  Article 4.7 (technology transfer), and reference to these items in  the draft conclusions was deleted.

On Thursday, 13 June, the draft conclusions were presented to the  SBSTA Plenary. On future work, Co-Chair van Ypersele said Parties  would be invited to submit views on the work programme by 20  August for compilation into a document for further consideration  at SBSTA-17, and for possible adoption at COP-8. Botswana, on  behalf of the G-77/China, proposed an amendment to the conclusions  to reaffirm the need for a work programme, taking into account  national circumstances and the availability of resources. The  SBSTA adopted the conclusions, as amended.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.11 and  Add.1) reaffirm the need for a work programme; request the  Secretariat to prepare a report on a potential information  clearing house on Article 6 activities; take note of the need to  consider reviewing the guidelines for national communications from  Annex I Parties as they relate to Article 6 activities; invite the  SBI to consider, at SB-17, the issue of financial and technical  support in the implementation of a work programme on Article 6;  and take note of a bracketed draft decision on a work programme on  Article 6 that will be forwarded to COP-8 for further discussion.

## OTHER MATTERS

### CROATIAN PROPOSAL

On Friday, 7 June, the SBSTA considered the  special circumstances of Croatia under UNFCCC Article 4.6  (flexibility for countries with economies in transition). Parties  addressed Croatia's proposal to adjust the base year for its  greenhouse gas inventory from 1990 to 1991. Croatia, supported by  the Central Group of Eleven (CG-11), stressed its special  circumstances. The EU said implementation of Article 4.6 must not  undermine the integrity of the Protocol, and Uganda cautioned that  a decision would set a precedent. Jim Penman (UK) undertook  informal consultations. SBSTA adopted conclusions on the item on  Thursday, 13 June.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

The conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.7) note that  flexibility under Article 4.6 should be further considered at its  next session, with a view to advising the SBI at its seventeenth  session.

### CLEANER OR LESS GREENHOUSE GAS-EMITTING ENERGY

SBSTA addressed  this issue at a plenary session on Tuesday, 11 June, and draft  conclusions were adopted on Thursday 13, June. Chair Thorgeirsson  drew delegates' attention to the workshop report on cleaner or  less greenhouse gas-emitting energy (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.8).  Canada, opposed by the G-77/China, EU, CG-11 and Norway, proposed  a draft decision to permit it to receive assigned amount units  equivalent to the global environmental benefit created by its  exports of cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy in the  first commitment period, not exceeding 70 million tonnes of carbon  dioxide-equivalent annually (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.3/Add.1).

Many Parties asserted that Canadian cleaner energy exports  constitute 'business as usual' and questioned the proposed  decision's potential precedent-setting effect, its legal basis,  and its possible impact on incentives for Annex I Parties to  reduce emissions. The EU observed that the Marrakesh Accords took  national circumstances into account, and Tuvalu noted that the  proposal did not account for trade in unclean energy. The Russian  Federation expressed interest in a future discussion on the  matter, noting that his country also exports cleaner energy. Saudi  Arabia suggested that consideration on the proposed draft decision  not proceed until methodological and legal issues are resolved,  and proposed organizing a workshop and an IPCC evaluation. Canada,  with New Zealand, Japan and the Russian Federation, suggested that  Parties discuss the proposed draft decision further at COP-8.  Chair Thorgeirsson engaged in consultations, and on Thursday, 13  June, presented draft conclusions, which were adopted without  amendment.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.5),  SBSTA takes note of proposed approaches to issues related to  cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy, and of the report  of the workshop, and agrees to continue considering these issues  at SB-17.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLE 2.3

This issue was addressed by SBSTA on  Tuesday, 11 June. Saudi Arabia stressed the importance of Protocol  Article 2.3, which addresses the adverse effects of Annex I  Parties' P&Ms and urged a workshop on the matter. He noted the  distinction between this article and Protocol Article 3.14, which  he said addresses adverse effects resulting from Annex I Parties'  implementation of commitments. Japan noted a COP-7 decision  (9/CP.7) requesting the Secretariat to organize a workshop before  COP/MOP-2 relating to reporting on minimizing impacts of response  measures and, supported by the EU and Canada, said this addressed  Saudi Arabia's concerns. Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kuwait and United  Arab Emirates said a separate workshop should be held specifically  on Article 2.3.

Chair Thorgeirsson suggested that Parties reflect on the issue and  submit their views to the Secretariat. He said he would undertake  informal consultations. On Thursday, 13 June, Parties adopted  conclusions on the item.

### SBSTA Conclusions:

In the conclusions (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/CRP.2), the  SBSTA agrees to continue consideration of the item at SB-17,  including the need for, timing of and elements for possible  workshops and the possibility of holding an initial workshop  before SB-19. The conclusions request the Secretariat to consider  Article 2.3 in the compilation of information on P&Ms of Annex I  Parties in the third national communications of Annex I Parties.

## CLOSING SBSTA PLENARY

On Friday afternoon, 14 June, Parties adopted the report of SBSTA- 16 (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/L.1). Chair Thorgeirsson thanked delegates,  his Co-Chairs and the Secretariat, and said he looked forward to  seeing everyone again in New Delhi. He gaveled the meeting to a  close at 2:45 pm.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

SBI Chair Raúl Estrada-Oyuela (Argentina) opened the first meeting  of SBI-16 on Monday, 10 June. In a welcoming statement, UNFCCC  Executive Secretary Joke Waller-Hunter stressed a focus on  implementation and noted the important role of SBI in this  context.

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

On Monday, 10 June, Parties considered the  agenda (FCCC/SBI/2002/1 and Add.1). Canada raised uncertainties  over the status of the agenda item on implementation of Protocol  Article 2.3, as noted in the opening meeting of the SBSTA on  Wednesday, 5 June. The G-77/China, opposed by the EU and Japan,  supported including this item on the agenda.

The US proposed an additional agenda item entitled 'transparency  in the UNFCCC process.' Adoption of the agenda was deferred and  Parties agreed to continue consideration of other agenda items.

On Wednesday, 12 June, Parties took up the adoption of the agenda  again. The US noted that his country's proposal was now entitled  'effective participation in the UNFCCC process.' Parties disagreed  on procedural matters, and adoption of the agenda was postponed.

Returning to the US proposal on Friday, 14 June, the US stressed  interest in participating as an observer to the CDM Executive  Board, and encouraged greater participation by NGOs. Chair Estrada  said a paper would be prepared by the Secretariat containing an  analysis of the situation in other bodies and a description of  possible solutions.

Parties then proceeded to adopt the agenda, without the agenda  item on implementation of Protocol Article 2.3, which was taken up  by SBSTA instead.

## ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

The agenda item on Annex I national communications was considered  by the SBI Plenary on Monday, 10 June, and draft conclusions were  adopted on Friday, 14 June.

On Monday, the Secretariat drew attention to a document  (FCCC/SBI/2002/3) that details greenhouse gas emissions trends for  Annex I Parties and suggests options for improving the process of  reviewing and considering national communications.

Observing that emissions trends left 'no grounds for complacency,'  the EU proposed that the review process be considered at SB-17.  Canada, the US and Australia stated that the current process works  well, and opposed any modifications at this time.

Chair Estrada highlighted the status report on the review of third  national communications (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.4).

On Friday, 14 June, Chair Estrada presented the draft conclusions,  proposing deletion of 'according to available data' in paragraph  one. The draft conclusions were adopted without further amendment.

### SBI Conclusions:

The conclusions on Annex I national  communications (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.3) include agreement that the SBI  will further consider, at SB-17, issues relating to the  improvement of the review process, and what action could be taken  to facilitate the timely submission of national communications.

## NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

Parties discussed the agenda item on non-Annex I national  communications in the SBI Plenary on Monday and Tuesday, 10-11  June, addressing three sub-items on work of the Consultative Group  of Experts (CGE), revision of the guidelines and financial and  technical support. Closed informal consultations were held  throughout the week to develop draft conclusions, which were  adopted by the SBI Plenary on Friday, 14 June.

### WORK OF THE CGE

At the SBI Plenary on Monday, CGE Chair Isabelle  Niang-Diop (Senegal) reported on the activities of the CGE and SBI  Chair Estrada drew delegates' attention to relevant reports  (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.3; FCCC/SBI/2002/2).

During the SBI Plenary on Tuesday, Chair Estrada said draft  conclusions would be prepared on the work of the CGE. The  conclusions were adopted on Friday, 14 June.

### SBI Conclusions:

The conclusions on the CGE (FCCC/SBI/2002/CRP.2)  include an invitation to Parties to submit views on the review of  the mandate and terms of reference of the CGE, which will take  place at COP-8.

### REVISION OF GUIDELINES

At the SBI Plenary on Tuesday, 11 June,  Chair Estrada drew attention to the proposed improved guidelines  (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.2). The US called for a discussion on  timeframes, and made a specific proposal in this regard. She also  proposed that the CGE use national communications to assess  opportunities for mitigation and adaptation in developing  countries. An informal group convened in closed-door discussions,  and conclusions were adopted on Friday, 14 June.

### SBI Conclusions:

The conclusions on revision of the guidelines  (FCCC/SBI/2002/CRP.6) include an invitation to the GEF to provide  views on funding the activities outlined in the proposed improved  guidelines, and note that adequate funding for second national  communications on the basis of the revised guidelines should be  provided.

### FINANCIAL AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT

At the SBI Plenary on Tuesday,  Chair Estrada noted information received from the GEF  (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.1) and invited comments. Many Parties  highlighted the importance of financial support, and Chair Estrada  closed the discussion by observing that the subject would be  revisited at SB-17.

### SBI Conclusions:

The conclusions on financial and technical  support (FCCC/SBI/2002/CRP.3) take note of the progress made in  the preparation of national communications and the information  provided by the GEF.

## FINANCIAL MECHANISM

On Monday, 10 June, Parties considered review of the financial  mechanism. Chair Estrada invited delegates to provide feedback on  the performance of the GEF. The EU supported the GEF's funding of  medium-sized projects and welcomed its effort to streamline the  project cycle. Canada hoped the review would focus on a small  number of practical recommendations. The Russian Federation  stressed accountability. Parties agreed to hold informal  discussions, chaired by Rawleston Moore (Barbados).

On Friday, 14 June, Moore introduced the SBI draft conclusions on  the review of the financial mechanism, which were adopted in their  entirety.

### SBI Conclusions:

In these conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.5), the SBI  invites Parties, intergovernmental and non-governmental  organizations to provide information on their experiences  regarding the effectiveness of the financial mechanism by 8 July,  and requests the Secretariat to prepare a synthesis report on the  financial mechanism for consideration at SB-17 on the basis of  submissions received and other documents.

## ADVERSE EFFECTS

The issue of implementing UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9 (adverse  effects) was considered by the SBI Plenary on Tuesday, 11 June,  and referred to a contact group, which met three times. The group  agreed on draft conclusions, which were adopted by the SBI on  Friday, 14 June.

On Tuesday, Daniela Stoytcheva (Bulgaria) reported on a workshop  held from 16-18 May, on the status of modeling activities to  assess the adverse effects of climate change and the impact of  response measures. She said the report of the workshop would be  presented for consideration at COP-8, and noted that two  additional workshops to be held prior to COP-8 would address  insurance and risk assessment. Zimbabwe, on behalf of the G-77/China, highlighted the importance of developing a mechanism to  ensure implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9, and expedited  activities under Article 4.9 (LDCs). The US stated that current  modeling remains highly uncertain, and Canada and Australia  stressed the importance of data availability. Iran, Algeria and  Burkina Faso encouraged establishing links with capacity building  and UNFCCC Article 6. Chair Estrada, opposed by Canada, Australia,  and Japan, said submissions on this issue made by Saudi Arabia and  Iran could be compiled in a miscellaneous document for  consideration by COP-8. A contact group chaired by Daniela  Stoytcheva, was formed to consider draft conclusions.

On Wednesday, 12 June, Parties discussed Chair Stoytcheva's draft  conclusions in the contact group. Zimbabwe, on behalf of the G-77/China, opposed the conclusions, stressing that they failed to  make clear reference to COP-7 decision 5/CP.7 on adverse effects.  She also opposed a sub-paragraph that notes that in the absence of  funding, the proposed insurance and risk assessment workshops  could be scheduled for after COP-8. Iran stressed that the  conclusions should adequately reflect consideration of future  modeling activities. Australia, Canada, the EU and US said Parties  should follow SBI Chair Estrada's request for a decision on  process, not on substance. Parties agreed to delete reference to  financial contributions, but were unable to reach consensus on the  importance of modeling activities, the scope of submission of  Parties' views, and future workshops and their terms of reference.  Chair Stoytcheva adjourned the meeting to hold informal  consultations.

Delegates reconvened in the evening to consider revised draft  conclusions. The G-77/China maintained that draft conclusions  failed to reflect their concerns regarding the importance of wider  implementation activities. New Zealand, Canada, the EU and US  supported the revised conclusions, stating that they provided 'a  balanced compromise.' Following informal consultations by Chair  Stoytcheva with those Parties opposing the draft conclusions,  delegates agreed to forward them to SBI. On Friday, 14 June, SBI  adopted these conclusions in their entirety.

### SBI Conclusions:

According to the conclusions  (FCCC/SBI/2002/CRP.5), the SBI: invites Parties to submit views on  the workshop and implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9 by 1  August; invites Parties to submit their views on possible  additions to the terms of reference  for these workshops by 1  August; and decides to consider workshop outcomes at SB-17.

## LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

Parties considered LDCs in the SBI Plenary Tuesday, 11 June. The  LDC Expert Group (LEG) Chair Bubu Jallow (Gambia) remarked on the  LEG's proposed work programme (FCCC/SBI/2002/5). Mali supported  prioritizing the implementation of national adaptation programmes  of action (NAPAs). The EU said the LEG should focus on strategic  activities where it has a comparative advantage.

Draft conclusions were presented to the SBI Plenary on Friday, 14  June, and adopted without amendment.

### SBI Conclusions:

The SBI conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/CRP.4) include  an endorsement of the LEG's programme of work, and invite the  Chair of the LEG to update the SBI on progress in the  implementation of this programme of work at SB-17.

## CAPACITY BUILDING

The SBI Plenary addressed capacity building on Tuesday, 11 June.  Chair Estrada noted that frameworks for building capacity in  developing countries and EITs were adopted at COP-7. The G-77/China welcomed funding to facilitate implementing capacity- building activities.

Draft conclusions were presented to the SBI Plenary Friday, 14  June, and adopted without amendment.

### SBI Conclusions:

The SBI conclusions (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.4) take note  of the need to support the implementation of capacity-building  activities relating to the preparation of national inventories and  establishment of national systems, and include an invitation for  Parties to submit their views on the implementation of national  capacity needs self-assessments funded by the GEF.

## CACAM REQUEST

On Wednesday, 12 June, Armenia, on behalf of a group of countries  from Central Asia and the Caucasus, Albania and Moldova (CACAM),  said the group was seeking clarification on the definition of the  term 'developing countries,' and on their status in the context of  UNFCCC decisions, including those prepared at COP-6. He said the  CACAM countries were proposing that all references to 'developing  countries' in these decisions should be changed to 'developing  countries and other Parties not included in Annex I.' The EU said  care should be taken when drafting conclusions, using the term  'Parties not included in Annex I,' as employed in the UNFCCC text.  Venezuela, on behalf of the G-77/China, said examination of the  term 'developing countries' was not necessary. Chair Estrada said  he would continue consultations and report back at SB-17.

## PREPARATIONS FOR THE WSSD

On Monday, 10 June, Morocco reported to the SBI on preparations  for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). He briefed  delegates on the negotiations in Bali, noting that Parties had  been unable to reach agreement on the means for implementation,  resulting in a breakdown. Pakistan, on behalf of the G-77/China,  expressed the Group's continued commitment to the WSSD and noted  concerns that Parties were failing to fulfill their Rio  commitments. The EU urged strengthening links between the climate  change and WSSD processes and noted the need for schedules and a  programme of action.

## INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

At the SBI Plenary on Monday, 10 June, the Secretariat introduced  a document on arrangements for intergovernmental meetings  (FCCC/SBI/2002/4). On COP-8, the Secretariat suggested replacing  the high-level segment containing national statements with a  roundtable discussion. On arrangements for the first Conference of  the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto  Protocol (COP/MOP-1), the EU supported work on common issues for  the COP and COP/MOP, and the definition of necessary rules and  procedures. Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Australia supported  the use of existing UNFCCC rules of procedure. On the programme  for future sessions, the Secretariat highlighted its concern about  the growing number of workshops. Chair Estrada suggested  prioritizing workshops and improving workshop preparation.

On the budget for conference services, the US, Japan and Canada  said conference expenses should be borne by the UNFCCC budget and  not the regular budget of the UN General Assembly (UNGA). On COP- 9, Chair Estrada indicated that its venue has not yet been  determined. The SBI adopted conclusions on these sub-items at its  closing Plenary session on Friday, 14 June.

### SBI Conclusions:

In the conclusions on intergovernmental meetings  (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.2), the SBI thanks the Government of India for  hosting COP-8, recommends ministerial roundtable discussions, and  urges Parties to contribute to the Trust Fund for Participation.  Regarding arrangements for COP/MOP-1, the SBI notes that 74  Parties have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and agrees to further  consider procedural issues at SBI-17. Regarding the programme for  future sessions, the SBI takes note of proposed future workshops  and meetings, expresses concern at their number, and encourages  the Secretariat to explore the possibility of convening workshops  in association with the sessional period while considering  constraints for small delegations. Regarding the budget for  conference services, the SBI takes note of Party views and of  developments at the 56th session of the UN General Assembly.  Regarding the venue of COP-9, the SBI urges Parties to offer to  host the meeting.

## ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL MATTERS

This agenda item was addressed by the SBI Plenary on Monday, 10  June. Regarding the status of contributions, the Secretariat  introduced the report on the interim financial performance for the  biennium 2002-2003 (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.5). She drew attention to  the fact that there were currently 190 contributions outstanding.  Regarding possible options for responding to late payment of  contributions, the Secretariat stated that publishing this  information encouraged timely payment, and drew attention to a  draft decision forwarded by SB-15 for adoption by COP-8. On  implementation of the Headquarters Agreement, Germany gave a  progress report, noting that plans for a UN campus and new  conference facilities in Bonn are moving ahead. UNFCCC Executive  Secretary Waller-Hunter welcomed the plans and thanked the German  Government. Chair Estrada said he would draft SBI conclusions on  this agenda item. The conclusions were adopted by the SBI Plenary  on Friday, 14 June.

### SBI Conclusions:

In the conclusions, included in the report of the  session (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.1), the SBI takes note of the status of  contributions as of 31 May 2002. It requests the Chair to continue  consultations on possible options for responding to late payment  of contributions and report back to SBI-17, and invites the host  government and UNFCCC Executive Secretary to report, at SBI-17, on  further progress on the implementation of the Headquarters  Agreement.

## OTHER MATTERS

### PROPOSAL BY CROATIA ON LULUCF

This item was considered on  Wednesday, 12 June. Parties addressed the proposal by Croatia to  consider its forest management activities under Protocol Article  3.4 (additional activities). Chair Estrada noted consultations on  a separate Croatian proposal to changing its base-year emissions  were being undertaken by SBSTA. He said that both issues would be  resolved concurrently, and that the proposals would be addressed  at SB-17. The EU noted that the discounted forest management value  proposed by Croatia exceeds the value provided by the FAO, and  said the matter should be forwarded to SBSTA for consideration  once the question of the base-year emissions has been resolved.  Croatia said it did not consider it necessary for SBSTA to address  this issue given that a technical review had already been carried  out, and agreed with Chair Estrada's suggestion to take up both  issues simultaneously at SB-17.

## CLOSING SBI PLENARY

On Friday, 14 June, SBI Rapporteur Emily Ojoo-Massawa (Kenya)  introduced the report of the session (FCCC/SBI/2002/L.1). Chair  Estrada went through the document paragraph-by-paragraph and noted  that a draft decision on the implementation of the Headquarters  Agreement would be forwarded directly to the COP. He said  conclusions on reporting and review of greenhouse gas inventories  agreed in SBSTA had also been forwarded directly to the COP,  rather than to the SBI. Parties adopted the report of the session.  Chair Estrada thanked participants, the Secretariat, and Co-Chairs  and closed the sixteenth session of SBI at 11:48 am.

# A BRIEF ANALYSIS OF SB-16 PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE

'I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!' Scrooge  repeated, as he scrambled out of bed. 'The Spirits of all Three  shall strive within me.' In one of Charles Dickens' classic novels the central character,  Ebenezer Scrooge, is visited by ghostly apparitions. Three  supernatural spirits compel Scrooge to consider his past, present  and future, leading him to question not only who he is, but in  what direction he wants the rest of his life to go.

At SB-16 the climate process seemed on the brink of a similar  identity crisis. The eerily quiet corridors and half-empty plenary  meetings encountered at the Maritim Hotel in Bonn presented a  stark contrast to the intensity and urgency that characterized a  succession of climate negotiations leading to COP-7 late last  year. One delegate labeled it 'the post-Marrakesh blues.' Another  described the shift in mood as 'spooky.' In reality, change was inevitable. The agreement in November on  the Marrakesh Accords brought to a close a major chapter in the  climate change story by concluding work on the operational details  of the Kyoto Protocol. With the urgent and immediate Protocol- related problems apparently solved, SB-16 was able to take up a  range of issues largely ignored during the past few years, and to  start considering what happens next.

What became apparent at SB-16 is just how different Parties' views  are on what direction the climate process should take. The meeting  was haunted by contradictory stances on the focus and intent of  this and future negotiations. Some Parties wanted to keep that  focus firmly on the present, tackling short-term technical tasks  while essentially maintaining a holding pattern until entry into  force of the Protocol and the generation of further political  momentum. Other Parties seemed to have their sights set on the  future and the need to start discussing long-term objectives and  future commitments - an approach that met with stern resistance in  some quarters. Still others, such as the Canadians, were arguably  more focused on the recent past and their hopes to continue  debates from Marrakesh by securing terms that would make  ratification more politically palatable. This analysis will  consider each of these perspectives in turn.

## CLAIMED BY THE PRESENT?

Those delegates focused on the present seemed convinced that  tackling technical tasks should be the main priority at SB-16.  They felt that the meetings' mandate was to agree on process,  rather than address the 'substantive' issues of wider  implementation. They argued that now is not the time to push too  hard on longer-term issues, given the current climate of  uncertainty over entry into force of the Protocol, and the  apparent lack of political momentum for going beyond what was  agreed at Marrakesh. These delegates, from both North and South,  felt that 'tinkering' with technical matters would be more  pragmatic than pushing prematurely for greater gains, which could  possibly further entrench positions.

This attitude was certainly reflected in the agenda, which  included many technical and methodological issues, such as  guidelines on greenhouse gas inventories, the revised uniform  reporting format on AIJ in the pilot phase, terms of reference for  workshops, and guidance to new specialist bodies like the Expert  Group on Technology Transfer. Advocates of this perspective  justified their approach by noting constructive discussions and  visible outcomes in the groups considering these matters.

## PREMONITIONS OF THE FUTURE

Some Parties attending SB-16 also had their sights set on the  future. Observers identified a clear desire within the EU,  Switzerland, and some others to begin a dialogue on long-term  objectives and future commitments. These Parties felt that having  'closed the book on the BAPA' at Marrakesh, it was now appropriate  to begin looking beyond the first commitment period. This view was  articulated at the very start of the meeting, when Norway called  on SBSTA to launch a process to strengthen commitments beyond  2012.

This position met with strong resistance in some quarters. In  particular, a number of the larger developing countries, such as  China, were clearly reluctant to discuss future commitments, which  in the words of one delegate, would be 'premature and unfair.' This conflict was most obvious in discussions on the IPCC's Third  Assessment Report, on policies and measures, and guidelines on  non-Annex I national communications.

The contact group charged with producing draft conclusions on the  TAR had a particularly difficult time, spending late nights mired  in disagreements over text that would begin a process focusing on  long-term objectives.

While the final text on the TAR may have pleased some, others were  clearly disappointed. New Zealand's statement in the closing SBSTA  Plenary regretting the 'weak' language captured the sense of  frustration at the lack of some Parties' willingness to  compromise. Divergence within the G-77/China was also apparent on  this issue, with many smaller countries, such as some AOSIS  members, also more eager to deal with long-term commitments.

Initial exchanges on policies and measures also illustrated the  divergence of opinions on what direction to take. While the EU  favored a focus on domestic action, Saudi Arabia wanted the  impacts of response measures on developing countries at the top of  the agenda. Meanwhile, the US and Japan preferred a focus on  information exchange, avoiding a prescriptive approach. The  ensuing discussion was more straightforward, if only because the  Chair restricted it to simple procedural matters, and grounded it  in the relevant COP-7 decision.

## HAUNTED BY THE PAST

Some Parties also came to Bonn with an eye to the recent past.  Canada's proposals on cleaner energy exports and sinks in the CDM,  which would reduce the costs of meeting their emissions reduction  target, were viewed by many as an attempt to reopen the deal  struck in Marrakesh. Some participants were resentful that, having  secured a favorable result at COP-7, Canada wanted to 'go back to  the trough for more' at SB-16.

In their defense, Canadian delegates cited an array of reasons for  their position, including the political and economic sensitivities  of several Canadian provinces, and the unforeseen US decision to  repudiate the Protocol. Canada claims that if their companies have  to reduce emissions under the Protocol, they will face a  competitive disadvantage relative to their US counterparts. Better  terms would make ratification more politically palatable.

Though their arguments were not well received, Canadian delegates  did manage to place cleaner energy exports on the agenda for COP- 8, leading many to question how Canada, and other Parties still  considering ratification, will play their hands in New Delhi.

Meanwhile, the all-important matter of the Russian Federation's  position on the Protocol continued to hang over the heads of  delegates, much as it did in Bonn and Marrakesh. With the EU and  Japan recently ratifying and Australia following the US lead, all  eyes were focused on Russia's intentions. However, those hoping  for a clear signal at SB-16 left disappointed. And in an  intervention that sent shivers down the spines of many delegates,  Russia indicated its interest in Canada's proposal. The  intervention seemed to confirm fears that another major energy  exporting country yet to ratify would demand further concessions,  thereby undermining the Marrakesh deal.

## LAYING THE GHOSTS TO REST

The vast array of views expressed at SB-16 on the present state  and future of the climate process raised what one delegate called  'a crisis of identity.' Commenting on the current mood, several  self-styled 'climate dinosaurs' attending SB-16 emphasized the  need for leadership and vision to help Parties define the next  phase of negotiations. Noting the loss of many 'old faces' at SB- 16, one delegate highlighted the potential for the new Executive  Secretary to play a key role during this transition period. But in  the short-term, she may simply have to bide her time. Events in  Johannesburg at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in  late August could have spillover effects on this and other  environmental processes. More importantly still, a clear signal or  outcome on entry into force of the Protocol would have dramatic  implications for COP-8 and beyond.
