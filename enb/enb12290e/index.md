KAZAKHSTAN asked Parties to treat voluntary commitments undertaken  by his country with understanding. CUBA drew attention to  increasing and historical emissions in developed countries, and  criticized some countries for being indifferent to international  efforts against climate change. MONACO said it will soon ratify  the Protocol. BELARUS emphasized that it hopes to be included in  Annex B of the Protocol and undertake quantitative commitments.  Highlighting that it is in the process of ratifying the Protocol,  ZAMBIA and MAURITANIA urged all countries to implement their  commitments. PERU said developed countries must take the lead and  demonstrate their compliance with the Protocol. UNITED ARAB  EMIRATES urged Annex I Parties to respect their Convention and  Kyoto commitments.

###     Extreme Weather Events

Many speakers, including MADAGASCAR,  TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, and URUGUAY, drew attention to recent extreme  weather events. ROMANIA and SWITZERLAND reported on the impact of  extensive flooding in 2005.

AUSTRIA highlighted the goal of keeping global average  temperatures from increasing more than 2Â°C. PORTUGAL underscored  policies and measures and renewable energy, particularly windpower.

###     Observation Systems

SENEGAL, CAMEROON and GABON proposed creating  an observation system in Africa to develop indicators and monitor  and reinforce operational capacity to evaluate carbon sequestration.

###     Post-2012

ROMANIA welcomed discussions on a post-2012 framework  as an opportunity for 'intense cooperation among all governments.'  HUNGARY said changes since the 1990s meant it was timely to review  approaches to climate change, and supported President Dion's  efforts. JAPAN said Kyoto should be used as a springboard on the  'long journey to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,' and supported  work on Article 3.9 and a broader approach to create an effective  framework where all Parties participate. FINLAND said the  negotiations on Article 3.9 should be placed in the wider context  of global efforts and common but differentiated responsibilities.  Many speakers, including TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO, INDONESIA, ISRAEL,  CHILE, PERU and PARAGUAY also supported discussions in the context  of the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.

# CONSULTATIONS ON POST-2012

Consultations on how to move forward post-2012 took place  throughout Thursday in numerous meetings focused both on the  UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. Many Parties appeared to support moving  forward under multiple tracks involving Protocol Articles 3.9  (future commitments) and 9 (review of the Protocol) and the  UNFCCC, although some concerns remained about various elements in  this 'package' approach.

### FUTURE ACTIONS UNDER THE UNFCCC

Informal discussions on future  actions under the UNFCCC focused on President Dion's revised  proposal. Under the proposal, Parties would resolve to engage in  discussions on cooperative action to address climate change,  including advancing development goals sustainably, reducing  impacts on developing countries, and acting on adaptation,  technology and market issues. Parties would also agree to hold  workshops open to all Parties and to complete discussions at  COP 13.

### PROTOCOL ARTICLE 3.9

Following meetings held throughout the day,  Co-Chairs Alf Wills (South Africa) and David Drake (Canada)  convened a contact group and introduced a bracketed draft  containing two options with four sections each. Co-Chair Wills  explained that the first section contains a decision, the second  section addresses issues raised in relation to the 'global  response,' the third deals with issues related to Article 9  (review of the Protocol), and the fourth addresses both the global  response and Article 9.

Shortly before 9:00 pm, delegates agreed to the text as presented.  As of 11:15 pm, President Dion was holding a high-level meeting to  discuss the entire 'package' of issues on post-2012.

# CONSULTATIONS ON ADAPTATION

Informal consultations were held throughout the day in an attempt  to remove brackets from the draft COP decision. Under discussion  was reference to SIDS in the objective of the programme of work,  economic diversification, and reference to the Arctic, along with  LDCs and SIDS, as particularly vulnerable regions. Consultations  continued throughout the day.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

Progress on Article 3.9 on Thursday night had some delegates  smiling but 'vaguely confused.' The agreement on a bracketed  decision that sets out various options for how to proceed was  being interpreted as 'highly unusual but still a positive outcome'  by one insider. Further high-level discussions were taking place  late on Thursday night on the entire package of issues.

While news from the small group negotiations was positive, some  concerns were being expressed about the dwindling numbers in  plenary. Many ministers and high-level officials were left to  address a largely empty hall, prompting several delegates to  propose a more 'interactive' approach involving thematic  roundtables and panel discussions. However, no one disputed the  overall usefulness of the high-level segment, which increases  visibility and political commitment to the process, and allows for  a multitude of bilateral meetings to take place.

In other talk, many participants seemed excited at the imminent  prospect of former US President Bill Clinton's visit on Friday.
