# PLENARY

Delegates met late morning in a Plenary session to receive  information on the process for the high-level segment. President  Pronk reported on five decisions taken by the extended Bureau. He  said the Bureau had decided that the substantive negotiations  would take place on the basis of a Note by the Co-Chairs of the  negotiating groups (FCCC/CP/2001/CRP.8), a  'streamlined document'  that outlines clear options on all the key outstanding political  issues. Negotiations would take place in a closed main negotiating  group, chaired by President Pronk and guided by the Plenary. The  group is to report to Plenary on a daily basis, and be composed  of: one representative from the Environmental Integrity Group;  three from CG-11; one from Central Asia and Moldova; five from the  EU; six from the 'Umbrella Group'; and nineteen from non-Annex I  Parties. Each representative may be assisted by two delegates.  Various spin-off negotiating groups may be established if  required, and the groups will be chaired by persons designated by  the main group.

President Pronk explained that negotiations on technical issues  would continue Friday and Saturday in the four negotiating groups  that were established on Monday 16 July. In addition, a new  technical negotiating group, chaired by Harald Dovland, was  established to address Protocol Articles 5 (methodological  issues), 7 (communication of information), and 8 (review of  information).

President Pronk emphasized that there was clear agreement to avoid  any further discussion on procedural issues. The G-77/CHINA called  for a flexible approach on process, noting the possible need to  modify the size, format or functioning of the group. He urged  against having parallel political and technical negotiations.  President Pronk emphasized that no parallel negotiations would  occur if this might hamper the work of the group.

# MAIN NEGOTIATING GROUP

The main negotiating group of ministers and other high-level  officials began their work early afternoon, discussing the options  for key issues set out under the Note by the Co-Chairs of the  negotiating groups. This document sets out the key issues under  four sections: funding, technology transfer and adverse effects;  mechanisms; LULUCF; and compliance. Delegates discussed elements  of the first three sections, and will take up compliance issues on  Saturday morning.

### FINANCE

Participants began by discussing the finance section of  the Co-Chairs' Note. On funding and resource levels, delegates  discussed the questions addressing President Pronk's proposed  Adaptation and Special Climate Change funds. Options include  whether contributions to the funds should be voluntary or  mandatory and who should contribute; whether non-payment should  have consequences; and whether the GEF should establish and manage  the Special Climate Change fund. Questions on the Special Climate  Change fund also address: whether activities related to economic  diversification and measures for mitigation should be included,  and whether non-Annex I Parties would be required to implement  national strategies for mitigation and sequestration as a  condition for accessing new and additional funding from the fund.

General agreement was achieved on some aspects, and a consultation  group facilitated by Philippe Roch (Switzerland) was convened to  consider the questions further. This consultation group will  report back to the main negotiating group tomorrow. Remaining  issues to be discussed include technology transfer and adverse  effects.

### MECHANISMS

Negotiations commenced mid-afternoon on the fourteen  issues relating to mechanisms outlined in the Co-Chairs' Note. On  equity, two options are provided to describe the objective of  reducing differences in per capita emissions between developing  and developed country Parties: the first recognizes that the share  of global emissions originating in developing countries will grow  to meet their developmental needs, and affirms that developed  country Parties shall continue to reduce their emissions through  domestic [policies and measures] [actions] with a view to reducing  per capita inequities in emissions; the second emphasizes, inter  alia, that Annex I Parties shall implement and/or further  elaborate policies and measures in accordance with national  circumstances and with a view to reducing inequities in per capita  emissions.

On the issue of supplementarity, delegates considered four  options: no elaboration; Annex I Parties to meet commitments  'primarily' through domestic action since 1990, with each Party's  use of the mechanisms not exceeding 9% of its assigned amount;  Annex I Parties to meet commitments 'primarily' through domestic  action, with use of the mechanisms not exceeding reductions  achieved through domestic actions as reported in national  communications, and as assessed by the enforcement branch of the  compliance committee; or 'chiefly' through domestic action, with  implementation and/or elaboration of policies and measures, the  provision of relevant information, and with the facilitative  branch of the compliance committee addressing relevant questions  of implementation.

On whether emission reduction units (ERUs) and certified emission  reductions (CERs) can be generated by nuclear power projects, the  options are no mention of nuclear, or that Annex I Parties  'refrain from' using nuclear. Regarding the establishment of a  supervisory committee for verification of ERUs, the options are:  no committee, with verification being performed by teams  constituted by the Secretariat; or a committee, the composition of  which has to be agreed separately.

On the composition of the Executive Board, three options are  presented: four persons from each UN regional grouping and one to  represent small island developing States (SIDS); ten Parties, with  one from each regional group plus a SIDS representative, and two  each from an Annex I and non-Annex I Party; or eight Annex I  Parties and eight non-Annex I Parties, including one SIDS  representative. While delegates reportedly made some progress on a  number of options, significant disagreements remain on several key  issues.

The remaining issues to be discussed are: the application and  level of share of proceeds; the commitment period reserve level;  the compliance agreement as an eligibility requirement; the  unilateral CDM; Article 4 (joint fulfillment); special needs of  developing country parties; financial additionality; and equitable  geographic distribution of CDM projects.

### LULUCF

Delegates began discussing this issue Friday evening. The  key questions they addressed related to whether or not there  should be credits under Protocol Article 3.4 (additional  activities) during the first commitment period. If crediting is  allowed, a decision needs to be made on the extent of crediting  for forest management and agricultural activities (cropland  management, grazing land management, and revegetation). Options  for limiting credits from forest management include: the use of  individual Party negotiated caps; demonstrated additionality of  activities since 1990 against a baseline using approved  methodologies as well as negotiated caps; an overall cap divided  between Parties; and a formula-based approach with a discount and  a cap. During discussions, delegates focused on options for  including forest management, with some indication of compromise  emerging in favor of the option of an overall cap divided among  Parties. Remaining issues to be discussed are the inclusion of  LULUCF activities under the Protocol project-based mechanisms,  joint implementation and the CDM.

# LATE NIGHT PLENARY

Shortly after midnight Friday night, President Pronk reported back  to participants, noting that some good work had been done during  the day's ministerial negotiations. He said discussions on the  finance text were 'fruitful' on a number of issues. There was  consensus on the need for resources for adaptation and capacity  building. He noted support for the proposed Adaptation fund and a  Special Climate Change fund. However there were diverging views on  whether the funding related to the UNFCCC or Protocol, although a  compromise had been suggested. He noted discussion on the option  of sharing financial contributions on the basis of criteria to be  determined. However, many questions remained unanswered, with  negotiations set to continue Saturday in the consultation group.

Regarding discussions on the mechanisms, he said these had not yet  reached the 'fruitful' stage. However, he noted lengthy  discussions on several issues, including equity, supplementarity  and nuclear. He said Minister Pete Hodgson of New Zealand would  convene further talks on this issue.

On LULUCF, he said negotiators had focused on Article 3.4, and  that there had been 'movement.' He noted agreement on the need for  a set of common principles and environmental credibility and  predictability. He said Ambassador Estrada of Argentina would  convene discussions on LULUCF, and Minister Valli Moosa of South  Africa would facilitate the group on compliance.

President Pronk concluded the meeting stating that there is  progress and he remains hopeful that Parties will be able to reach  a compromise on the package as a whole in the two remaining days.

# INFORMAL DRAFTING GROUP ON CDM TECHNICAL ISSUES

The informal drafting group on CDM technical issues, chaired by  Jose Domingos Gonzales Miguez (Brazil), completed its discussions  Friday. The group was established on Wednesday, 18 July, to agree  text on the following issues: baselines and additionality; small- scale CDM project activities; environmental impact assessments;  public participation; review by the executive board; and  transaction of CERs. Text was agreed on the issues on the basis  that once a decision on the inclusion of sinks in the CDM has been  taken, this would need to be revisited. On small scale CDM project  activities, agreement has not been reached on the scales relating  to renewable energy project activities, energy efficiency  improvement project activities, or other project activities that  both reduce anthropogenic emissions by sources and that directly  emit less than a certain amount of kilo tons of carbon dioxide  equivalent annually. A request has been made that experts from  Parties may put forward some examples of project activities to the  Secretariat that illustrate the quoted figures. The full text on  all the issues will be revisited next week when negotiations  resume at the diplomatic level.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The corridors were humming Friday as talks entered the substantive  phase of the critical ministerial segment of COP-6 Part II.  Participants have been discussing proceedings from the main  negotiating group for Ministers held behind closed doors  throughout Friday. The general feeling seems to be that the Co- Chairs' text presents the options very clearly, although they also  demonstrate significant differences between Parties on many  issues. The verdict at the end of the first day of substantive  talks was cautiously optimistic, with observers noting what  appeared to be an important compromise involving sinks. The  prevailing mood was that a 'partial outcome' was a strong  prospect, with agreement in Bonn on some key issues, but with some  matters left to be resolved in Marrakech.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### MAIN NEGOTIATING GROUP

Ministers and high-level officials will be  meeting throughout the day to continue substantive negotiations in  closed meetings. They are scheduled to start with the text on  compliance at 10:00 am in the Liszt Room. Check the notice boards  for further details.
