# SUBSIDIARY BODY ON IMPLEMENTATION

## Financial Mechanism

The Secretariat summarized the  compilation of the views submitted by Parties  (FCCC/SBI/1997/MISC.3) and the synthesis report  (FCCC/SBI/1997/8). Chair Mohamed Ould El Ghaouth  (Mauritania) requested comments on the financial mechanism,  and noted that in the first replenishment period of the  Global Environment Facility (GEF) no climate change related  activities were denied funding. SAUDI ARABIA noted that the  GEF was sufficient for the interim period but was outdated.  Along with KOREA, IRAN and the G-77/CHINA, he called for  additional time to consider the financial mechanism.

KUWAIT, NIGERIA and SAUDI ARABIA suggested that Parties  consider other options for a financial mechanism. CHINA  called for an increase in the replenishment funds, and  requested that additional funds be allocated for technology  transfer. MALAYSIA noted that two of its project proposals  have been turned down by the GEF.

LUXEMBOURG, for the EU, stated that the report presented by  the Secretariat provided sufficient basis to support  replenishment, and suggested that the GEF be appointed the  permanent operating entity of the financial mechanism.  AUSTRALIA, the US, CANADA, JAPAN and the UK noted the  success of the GEF and supported making the GEF the  permanent financial mechanism at COP-3. The UK stated that  it is committed to the GEF, prepared to make substantial  contributions and called on other donors to do likewise.  The GEF welcomed the review of the financial mechanism and  noted that it has provided US$4 billion in operational  support for climate change projects. TANZANIA, on behalf of  the G-77/CHINA, called for all sources of information to be  carefully examined, and noted that he was willing to submit  a draft decision on the review process. A contact group  chaired by John Ashe (Antigua and Barbuda) was established  to consider the issues.

Non-Annex I Communications: The Secretariat presented  documents on Secretariat activities regarding financial and  technical support (FCCC/SBI/1997/9) and on the submission  of initial national communications (FCCC/SBI/1997/13). She  noted that Argentina and Jordan have submitted national  communications and 40 other non-Annex I Parties had  indicated they would do so by 2000. LUXEMBOURG, for the EU,  said the review process for non-Annex I communications  should begin as soon as possible. CANADA urged acceleration  of non-Annex I communications. She supported a process for  consideration of non-Annex I communications as a way of  advancing commitments under Article 4.1, including  guidelines and country visits.  AUSTRALIA emphasized the  review component as an integral part of the process, noting  that country visits with participation by non-Annex I  experts were helpful in the Annex I Parties process.

ARGENTINA said consideration of non-Annex I communications  should be facilitative, not confrontational, and that he  had no problem with in-depth studies of non-Annex I  communications. TANZANIA, for the G-77/CHINA, supported by  AUSTRALIA and CUBA, said the discussion of Annex I and non- Annex I communications should be based on differentiation.  CHINA and MALAYSIA recommended an overall assessment rather  than individual review, noting that initial non-Annex I  Parties' communications may not be as consistent or  complete as Annex I Parties'. The US said consideration on  non-Annex I Parties' commitments need not be as detailed  nor as extensive as that for Annex I Parties. She said  compilation and synthesis of non-Annex I communications did  not require the same schedule or frequency but could  contribute to a comprehensive synthesis report, which could  identify gaps or inconsistencies in non-Annex I  communications.

The PHILIPPINES said a greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement  strategy is beyond developing country commitments and  should not be mentioned except as a possible voluntary  activity. With CHINA, INDIA, MALAYSIA and COLOMBIA, she  emphasized that non-Annex I communications are governed  only by FCCC provisions and the relevant COP-2 decisions.  ZIMBABWE, CUBA and others said provision of initial  communications is linked to provision of funds. SAUDI  ARABIA said the financial support must be sustainable and  linked to capacity building.

The REPUBLIC OF KOREA and MALAYSIA underscored varying  country conditions and capacities. BANGLADESH and BURKINA  FASO supported regional workshops. JAPAN said it is  strengthening training courses for developing country  experts to increase capacity. SENEGAL promised to submit  its communication between now and Kyoto. The Chair  suggested a contact group led by the US and Malaysia.

Arrangements for Intergovernmental Meetings: Delegates  considered document FCCC/SBI/1997/11. On arrangements for  COP-3, the G-77/CHINA, supported by NIGERIA, VENEZUELA,  SAUDI ARABIA, KUWAIT, CHINA, MALI, IRAN, KOREA, CENTRAL  AFRICAN REPUBLIC, COLOMBIA and INDIA said the proposed  ministerial segment must include all heads of delegations  and their advisors, not just ministers. Some delegations  said it should be re-named a 'high level' segment and any  text for discussion must be distributed well in advance of  the ministerial roundtable. On COP-3 agenda, the G-77/CHINA  supported holding COP-4 in 1998. The EU and AUSTRALIA  preferred scheduling COP-4 in early 1999. ARGENTINA noted  that the proposal to hold COP-4 in 1999 came from the  steering committee of COP not the Secretariat.

The EU supported proposals for a ministerial roundtable and  favored replacing general debates with written statements  in order to focus on protocol negotiations. The PHILLIPINES  said her vice-minister was excluded from speaking at COP-2  for lack of time, something which should not be repeated in  Kyoto. The US and INDIA expressed dissatisfaction with the  COP-2 roundtable and said ministers should be allowed to  give statements. NIGERIA, CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA cautioned  against selected partner organizations and NGOs in the  ministerial roundtable and questioned who would make the  selections. JAPAN said NGOs should be excluded from the  ministerial segment given its highly political nature.

# AD HOC GROUP ON ARTICLE 13

Chair Patrick Szell (UK) reconvened AG13 to proceed with a  paragraph-by-paragraph review of the draft compilation of  proposals for a multilateral consultative process (MCP)  (FCCC/AG13/1997/2 Annex II). Parties agreed on a  reformulated introductory paragraph prepared by a working  group chaired by Zimbabwe. The paragraph establishes the  MCP as a set of procedures to be served by a committee.  There was no agreement on whether the committee should be  standing or ad hoc or whether it should be established  under the SBI.

On the second paragraph, which sets out objectives, the  Chair noted an EU proposal, supported by SWITZERLAND and  AUSTRALIA, to refer to the 'process' rather than the  committee. The US, supported by SAUDI ARABIA, proposed that  the MCP provide Parties with advice on 'their'  implementation of the Convention. The EU said Article 13 of  the FCCC  refers to advice on 'the' implementation.

On the subparagraphs of paragraph 2, there was no agreement  on the objectives of promoting understanding of the  Convention and preventing disputes. The Chair noted support  from IRAN, CHILE and CHINA for the inclusion of the  provision of assistance to Parties together with an EU  suggestion that the committee advise other elements of the  FCCC on providing financial and technological assistance.  The Chair agreed to note IRAN's proposal, supported by  SAUDI ARABIA, to reformulate subparagraphs 2(a), (d) and  (e), to read: 'Providing [consultative] assistance to the  Parties in need in order to facilitate implementation of  the Convention and finding solutions to the possible  problems in this regard.' The Chair noted that the question  of providing assistance was likely to continue to haunt the  Parties.

AUSTRALIA and the US objected to a suggestion by  SWITZERLAND, supported by FRANCE, that the objectives  include a reference to a protocol. The Chair advised  Parties to forget references to a protocol until next year.

The EU proposed changing the order of paragraphs in the  compilation text. Parties agreed to move a paragraph on the  nature of the MCP (paragraph 6) to create a new paragraph 3  and to remove brackets from a reference to 'timely' conduct  of the process and from a reference to full participation  by concerned Parties. SAUDI ARABIA , CHINA  and SAINT LUCIA  considered that a non-confrontational and transparent  process called for participation by concerned Parties. The  EU concurred. SWITZERLAND and FRANCE questioned involvement  of concerned Parties at the final stages of the process.  The Chair noted that the meaning of 'process' throughout  the text should now be understood in light of the new first  paragraph.

The Chair explained that paragraph 5, which states that the  MCP will be separate from and without prejudice to the  provisions of FCCC Article 14 (settlement of disputes), is  based on wording from the Montreal Protocol. SAUDI ARABIA  recalled that FCCC Article 13 is not a non-compliance  procedure. The Chair invited Parties to ask whether the  MCP's relationship to the settlement of disputes in FCCC  Article 14 arose at all, given its 'helpline' nature.

In the afternoon, discussion took place on a paragraph  concerning the committee mandate, which is to become a new  paragraph. It was agreed that the title should be changed  to 'Mandate of the Committee.' The EU proposed reversing  the order of subparagraph (a) (providing assistance) and  (b) (submissions and information), generating ample debate  on the priority each should be accorded. SWITZERLAND  considered that (b) was of a procedural nature and would be  better dealt with in accordance with procedural paragraph  12. The EU made a proposal to include some elements of (b)  in the chapeau. Upon a suggestion by the Chair, AG13 agreed  to delete (b) on the understanding that it would be dealt  with in the chapeau in similar terms to those proposed by  SWITZERLAND.

On (a)(i), it was decided to include a reference to  'resolution' of questions. On (a) (ii), there was  significant debate on provision of assistance to Parties.  Proposals in this regard were made by CHINA, SWITZERLAND,  the EU and the US. SWITZERLAND agreed to go along with the  EU proposal that assistance consist of advice and  recommendations on technical and financial aspects. The  remaining proposals will appear in the new compilation  text. On (c), there was considerable debate on the role of  the COP. The EU and FRANCE were of the view that the  brackets should be lifted. SAUDI ARABIA requested that (c)  be deleted. The US, JAPAN and SWITZERLAND considered that  it should remain bracketed. A reference to SBI was placed  in brackets.

# CONTACT GROUPS

The contact group on methodological issues heard  presentations from the Secretariat on guidelines for  reporting emissions inventory data, particularly regarding  recalculation of the base year inventory. The Secretariat  noted that estimation of GHG emissions using methods other  than those used in the base year inventory could impede an  accurate comparison between targets and base year  inventories. Participants also heard presentations on the  IPCC Work Programme and the UNEP Collaborating Centre.  Delegates further examined and completed their work on  amending the programme of work on methodologies.

The contact group on the division of labor between SBI and  SBSTA continued discussion on document FCCC/SB/1997/2.  During the discussions on guidelines for national  communications, some delegates cautioned against taking  action that would prejudge decisions to be taken on non- Annex I communications. Delegates accepted an amended  proposal from the US and Malaysia on technology transfer  and agreed to text on NGO consultations.
