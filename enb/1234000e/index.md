# AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE INFORMAL ROUND TABLE

### IMPACTS ON DEVELOPING COUNTRY PARTIES

A Round Table  discussion convened by the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate considered impacts of Annex 1 measures on developing  countries. Chair Kilaparti Ramakrishna (US) invited comments  on costs and benefits by panelists from the Philippines,  Saudi Arabia, the US, Trinidad and Tobago, and Brazil. They  called for mechanisms to share the burden of impacts of  Annex I actions resulting in, inter alia, lower growth and  inflationary pressures. It is not clear short term economic  measures will result in a slow down.

Responses can stimulate technological innovation, increasing  economic and welfare gains. They also discussed: the  limitations of economic modeling; consideration of the costs  of inaction including non-economic implications; and how  flexible and adaptive economies in fossil fuel importing  countries may experience positive impacts.

The participants then considered the differential  benefit/cost ratio of action vs. inaction to implement the  Berlin Mandate. There was general agreement that imposing  only 'punitive' measures such as carbon taxes would have a  disproportionate effect on developing country economies,  especially those dependent upon petroleum. One industry  representative stated that economic models predict a  negative but minimal initial impact of emissions  limitations, reducing growth by about 0.5%.

Several speakers suggested that the process of reducing  emissions could build a new base for global economic growth  inclusive of developing countries. Another participant  specifically referred to flexible market-based policies  allowing maximum innovation, though many emphasized fairness  and common but differentiated responsibility.

During subsequent discussion, it was stated that a study of  the benefit/cost ratio over 20 years of the US Clean Air Act  had yielded a figure of greater than 16 to 1. Another  speaker pointed out that, despite this, there was  substantial opposition from business to the renewal of the  law. Other participants discussed: using competitiveness to  disseminate new technologies; Annex 1 countries with links  to Pacific territories should note the impact of climate  change on their regional interests.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVICE

Several pending items were considered and the Chair reminded  SBSTA of the need to achieve consensus on remaining items by  Wednesday's Plenary. The Secretariat read the draft text and  conclusions on Agenda Item 5(d) (activities implemented  jointly). Both were adopted without amendment. On Agenda  Item 4(a) (Annex I communications), some amendments were  proposed for the guidelines for the preparation of national  communications. POLAND proposed that Parties with economies  in transition present emission level projections from 'base  years' rather than 1990.

The US proposed that Annex II Parties separately provide  information 'in accordance with' or 'on' each of their  commitments under Articles 4.3-4.5, rather than 'to fulfill'  their commitments. They should also provide information on  measures taken to promote, facilitate and finance access 'as  appropriate'. The Co-Chair of the contact group recommended  that Annex II Parties 'give effect to' rather than 'fulfill'  their commitments. The Co-chair's proposal was adopted. The  US suggested that Parties carry out 'as supplemental  information' adjustments on inventory data. This proposal  was later withdrawn at DENMARK's urging. The text for the  guidelines was then adopted.

Regarding the draft decision on Annex I communications,  POLAND sought clarification on the SBI's role in dealing  with Parties with economies in transition. The Chair noted  that this was an issue to be determined by SBI not SBSTA.  VENEZUELA and BURKINA FASO expressed concern about a tandem  review process where both SBSTA and SBI review the joint  contact groups' guidelines and decisions. The Chair stated  this could not be avoided and that each subsidiary body was  empowered only to adopt those provisions it would take part  in administering. On Agenda Item 9 (report to the COP), he  said that he will present general comments on SBSTA's work  on any unresolved items. SBSTA was then adjourned until 5:00  p.m. to allow for meetings of contact groups on the roster  of experts, the development and transfer of technology, use  of scientific assessments, and non-Annex I communications.

The Chair and the Co-Chairs for the contact group on the use  of scientific assessments introduced the Chair's summary of  SBSTA's discussion and draft decisions regarding use of the  SAR. The Chair reaffirmed SBSTA's mandate to advise the COP  on this issue. SAUDI ARABIA noted that the views of all  delegations, including his own, were not acknowledged in the  Chair's summary. He urged that the lack of scientific  certainty be better reflected as well as Parties' cost  differentials in implementing the FCCC.

The RUSSIAN FEDERATION stated that the summary should be  adopted at an official session with interpretation and that  the text should reflect the exact language submitted by  delegations. KUWAIT disagreed with a reference to the SAR as  a 'clear indication' of the likelihood of climate change,  and noted that the optimum strategy for addressing the  problem will depend on the circumstances of each country.  The EU said that individual members of the EU will make  interventions on specific points.

The Chair noted that the exact wording of the proposals for  each delegation was not reflected but the message of each  was included. The US noted that the balance in the paragraph  noting the divergent views did not represent SBSTA's  discussion. The G-77/CHINA recommended referring to the  'human face' of climate change and to developing countries  suffering the effects of climate change.

Following a brief consultation with the G-77/CHINA, Saudi  Arabia and the EU, the Chair amended a reference to the SAR  as 'an assessment,' rather than a 'clear indication' of the  likelihood of climate change. He added a sentence noting  large cost differentials of reducing GHGs among countries,  and inserted a reference to areas such as agriculture, water  resources and human health in regard to the socio-economic  impacts on developing countries. The US, the MARSHALL  ISLANDS, the EU, CANADA, NORWAY, JAPAN and AOSIS voiced  concern that the text was not balanced and asked that their  objection be noted on the record. The Chair stated it was  'useless' to continue deliberations on this issue.

The issue of whether the SAR is to be used 'as a basis for  urgent action to implement the convention' or 'taken into  account during consideration of the implementation of the  FCCC...bearing in mind the lack of scientific certainty in  some of the information' will be left to the COP to decide.  SBSTA will resume debate with the hope of reaching consensus  on the remaining points of decision and solidifying its  recommendations for the COP.

# AD HOC GROUP ON THE BERLIN MANDATE

The Chair commenced by summarizing previous discussion on  Agenda Item 5 (possible features of a protocol or other  instrument), stating that: the form of the legal instrument  should flow from its substance; the new instrument should be  served by existing institutions; and many Parties supported  a simple protocol which was open to all FCCC Parties and was  flexible. Chairs of the Round Table discussions on Policies  and Measures, and on QELROs, then gave their summaries.

Following this, Ian Pickard (UK), chair of the Annex I  Expert Group, presented a summary (FCCC/AGBM/1996/Misc.1/  Add.2) of a study entitled 'Policies and Measures for  Possible Common Action'. The report differentiates between  Annex I developed countries and those with economies in  transition.

The Chair then invited general comments on policies and  measures and QELROs. ROMANIA agreed with the concept of  differentiated commitments but cautioned against using 1990  data for his country because GHG emissions decreased 20-40%  due to major political changes. BANGLADESH emphasized  developed countries' obligations to reduce GHG emissions.

The EU described previous work on policies and measures for  a protocol, including impacts on international  competitiveness. He called the SAR of the IPCC the  'principal reference report' for global emissions reduction  objectives. The EU prefers to see GHG emissions levels below  550 ppmv, and it is essential for Parties to bring specific  proposals for a legally binding instrument to the table at  AGBM-5.

AUSTRALIA cautioned that the potential to limit GHG  emissions without seriously undermining economic growth is  limited. She stated that flat emissions reductions are not  environmentally- or cost-effective or equitable. Calling  differentiation 'central', she suggested three illustrative  approaches to differentiation, with emissions reductions  based on: projected emissions trends; factors such as  population growth; and considerations embodied in trade.

NORWAY favored binding commitments that are differentiated,  cost-effective, equitable and verifiable. The US said  proposals will have to be concluded early in 1997 for  adoption at COP-3. The REPUBLIC OF KOREA and KUWAIT called  for equity and fair burden sharing. NEW ZEALAND said  flexibility will be a key factor in AGBM process and  outcomes. JAPAN said it is essential to allow each Party to  choose policies and measures.

SWITZERLAND, supported by MALI, called for a dynamic  approach and proposed three categories of commitment. CANADA  said policies and measures should reinforce a positive  relationship between the economy and the environment. The  RUSSIAN FEDERATION said policies and measures must  acknowledge a right to sustainable development. AOSIS,  supported by the PHILIPPINES and the MALDIVES, said the SAR  is sufficient to allow agreement on QELROs.

URUGUAY said measures must be incumbent on Parties beyond  their contamination threshold. The NETHERLANDS underscored  support for policies based on a view that a temperature  increase exceeding 2 degrees is not tolerable. The  PHILIPPINES stated that QELROs should be legally binding.

# IN THE CORRIDORS I

Contact groups of the SBI met today. Among the issues  discussed was communications from non-Annex I Parties.  According to some delegates, developing countries objected  to the suggestion that non-Annex I national reports include  information on mitigation measures. This opposition, it was  reported, is linked to objections to funding GHG mitigation  projects by the Global Environment Facility. Mitigation, it  was claimed, should be first pursued by developed countries.

# IN THE CORRIDORS II

Reliable sources confirmed that the venue for COP-3 will be  Kyoto, Japan.
