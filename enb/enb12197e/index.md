# SBI

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

On the work of the  Consultative Group of Experts (CGE), SBI Chair Estrada said draft  conclusions would be preparesd.

On the revision of guidelines, Chair Estrada drew attention to the  proposed improved guidelines (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.2). ZIMBABWE, for  the AFRICA GROUP, and SAMOA, welcomed the focus on vulnerability  and adaptation assessment. The US called for all Parties to submit  national communications every 3-5 years, and for all Parties, with  the exception of LDCs and those highly vulnerable to climate  change, to submit greenhouse gas inventories every two years. The  US also proposed that the CGE use national communications to  assess opportunities for mitigation and adaptation in developing  countries. TUVALU cautioned against overloading reporting  requirements, and said this distracts from implementing real  actions 'on the ground.' CHILE emphasized the voluntary nature of  the information contained in national communications. Chair  Estrada said an informal group would be convened later in the day.

On financial and technical support, Chair Estrada noted  information received from the GEF (FCCC/SBI/2002/INF.1). Many  Parties highlighted the importance of financial support. Chair  Estrada concluded the discussion by observing that the subject  would be revisited at SB-17.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

On implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9.  Daniela Stoytcheva (Bulgaria) reported on a workshop held from 16- 18 May on the status of modeling activities to assess the adverse  effects of climate change and the impact of response measures. She  said the report of the workshop would be presented for  consideration at COP-8, and noted that two additional workshops  under this decision prior to COP-8 will address insurance and risk  assessment.

ZIMBABWE, for the G-77/CHINA, highlighted the importance of a  mechanism to ensure implementation of Article 4.8 and 4.9, and  expedited activities under Article 4.9 (LDCs). The US stated that  current modeling remains highly uncertain, and CANADA and  AUSTRALIA stressed the importance of data availability. IRAN,  ALGERIA and BURKINA FASO encouraged establishing links with  capacity building and UNFCCC Article 6. Chair Estrada, opposed by  CANADA, AUSTRALIA, and JAPAN, said submissions on this issue made  by Saudi Arabia and Iran could be compiled in a miscellaneous  document for consideration by COP-8. A contact group was formed to  draft conclusions.

### LDCS

The LDC Expert Group (LEG) Chair Bubu Jallow (Gambia)  reported on LEG activities (FCCC/SBI/2002/5). He said the first  LEG meeting, held from 26-28 February 2002 in Arusha, Tanzania,  had elaborated the LEG's work programme. He stressed the  importance of capturing synergies between this work and activities  under other processes, as well as linkages to national sustainable  development strategies.

MALI supported prioritizing the implementation of national  adaptation programmes of action (NAPAs). The EU said the LEG  should focus on strategic activities where it has a comparative  advantage. The SBI endorsed the work programme.

### CAPACITY BUILDING

Chair Estrada noted that COP-7 had adopted  frameworks for building capacity in developing countries and EITs.  The Secretariat reported on progress made in their implementation,  stressing the need to exchange information on experiences prior to  the review of the frameworks at COP-9. The G-77/CHINA welcomed  funding to facilitate implementing capacity building activities,  and supported further efforts in this regard. The CG-11 stressed  the importance of capacity building, in particular as Protocol  ratification progresses. Chair Estrada took note of questions  raised by delegates regarding GEF funding and said he would  prepare draft conclusions addressing these concerns.

# SBSTA

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OZONE AND CLIMATE EFFORTS

On the  relationship between efforts to protect the stratospheric ozone  layer and those to safeguard the global climate system, GREENPEACE  urged Parties to minimize risks relating to hydrofluorocarbons  (HFCs).

## ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Adoption of the Agenda: Noting that  consultations had taken place on this matter, SBSTA Chair  Thorgeirsson invited delegates to adopt the agenda, including  amended items on 'issues related to cleaner or less greenhouse  gas-emitting energy' and on 'issues related to the implementation  of Protocol Article 2.3.' He said the SBSTA may refer components  of the latter item to the SBI, but it will not appear on the SBI  agenda. Delegates adopted the agenda.

## TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER

Chair Thorgeirsson reported that the Expert  Group on Technology Transfer (EGTT) had completed its work on  Saturday, 8 June. EGTT Vice Chair William Kojo Agyemang-Bonsu  (Ghana) reported on the agreed 2002-2003 work programme, and Chair  Thorgeirsson said relevant SBSTA conclusions would be drafted.

## OTHER MATTERS

### Proposal on Cleaner or Less Greenhouse Gas-Emitting  Energy:

Chair Thorgeirsson drew delegates' attention to the  workshop report on cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/INF.8). CANADA, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, EU,  CG-11 and NORWAY, proposed a draft decision to permit it to  receive assigned amount units equivalent to the global  environmental benefit created by its exports of cleaner or less  greenhouse gas-emitting energy in the first commitment period, not  exceeding 70 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent annually  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/MISC.3/Add.1). Many Parties asserted that  Canadian cleaner energy exports constitute 'business as usual' and  questioned the proposed decision's potential precedent-setting  effect, its legal basis, and its possible impact on incentives for  Annex I Parties to reduce emissions. The EU observed that the  Marrakesh Accords took national circumstances into account, and  TUVALU noted that the proposal did not account for trade in  unclean energy. The RUSSIAN FEDERATION expressed interest in a  future discussion on the matter, noting that his country also  exports cleaner energy. SAUDI ARABIA suggested that consideration  on the proposed draft decision not proceed until methodological  and legal issues are resolved, and proposed organizing a workshop  and an IPCC evaluation. CANADA, with NEW ZEALAND, JAPAN and the  RUSSIAN FEDERATION, suggested that Parties discuss the proposed  draft decision further at COP-8. Chair Thorgeirsson said he would  engage in consultations and present draft conclusions Thursday.

###     Implementation of Article 2.3:

SAUDI ARABIA stressed the  importance of Protocol Article 2.3, which addresses the adverse  effects of Annex I Parties' P&Ms. He noted the distinction between  this Article and Protocol Article 3.14, which he said addresses  adverse effects resulting from Annex I Parties' implementation of  commitments. He underscored international trade aspects in Article  2.3 and supported a workshop to examine the impacts of this trade.  He urged a synthesis report of P&Ms reported in Annex I national  communications and a COP-8 decision on any results of these  activities. JAPAN noted a COP-7 decision (9/CP.7) requesting the  Secretariat to organize a workshop before COP/MOP-2 relating to  reporting on minimizing impacts of response measures and,  supported by the EU and CANADA, said this addressed Saudi Arabia's  concerns. SAUDI ARABIA, LIBYA, KUWAIT and UNITED ARAB EMIRATES  stated that the workshop outlined in the COP-7 decision addressed  Article 3.14, and said a separate workshop should be held on  Article 2.3.

Chair Thorgeirsson suggested that Parties reflect on the issue and  submit their views to the Secretariat. He said he would undertake  informal consultations and present draft conclusions to the SBSTA  on Thursday.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ARTICLES 5, 7 AND 8

Delegates continued consideration of the  draft COP-8 decision on demonstrable progress under Protocol  Article 3.2, agreeing to text requesting Parties to report on  progress in accordance with UNFCCC and Protocol Article 7  guidelines, and 'incorporating any relevant contribution pursuant  to decision 13/CP.7,' which relates to work under P&Ms. Parties  could not agree on a G-77/CHINA proposal that the information  submitted should be evaluated along with the national  communication, and the issue will taken up in informal  consultations. An informal drafting group continued work  throughout the day on the expedited procedure for reinstatement of  eligibility to use the mechanisms.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&MS)

Co-Chair Suk-Hoon Woo (Republic of  Korea) introduced draft conclusions for consideration by the  group, noting that the text was based on language used in the  relevant COP-7 decision (13/CP.7).

The EU, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and others endorsed the text as a good  basis for further discussion. Stressing that good practice in P&Ms  applies to Annex I Parties, SAUDI ARABIA, for the G-77/CHINA,  proposed inserting reference to this in all appropriate parts of  the text.

On a paragraph requesting the Secretariat to organize a stock  taking exercise and exchange of views immediately before SB-17,  the EU, SAMOA, POLAND and SWITZERLAND preferred this exercise to  take the form of an intersessional informal consultation, while  the US, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and SAUDI ARABIA favored holding a side  event.

On text agreeing on a 'frame for action' to consider further steps  to advance work on P&Ms, the US proposed limiting the reference to  considering further steps 'in implementing decision 13/CP.7.' The  EU, SAMOA, NEW ZEALAND, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN preferred the original  formulation, or variations on this formulation. Co-Chair Pierre  Giroux said a revised text would be produced in time for the next  meeting on Wednesday.

### GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORIES

The contact group on guidelines on  reporting and review of greenhouse gas inventories from Annex I  Parties completed its work on the Co-Chairs' draft working paper,  and the report on the expert meeting to assess experiences  (FCCC/SBSTA/2002/2/Add.1). Parties agreed to some amendments to  the Co-Chairs' draft paper, including those on issues under the  general approach, scope of the initial check of annual  inventories, synthesis and assessment report, timing, and review  of individual annual inventories. Delegates concluded their work  by approving the Co-Chairs' draft SBSTA conclusions and draft COP- 8 decisions. The conclusions agree on the guidelines on reporting  and review of greenhouse gas inventories, and urge Parties to  submit their inventories in accordance with the guidelines and the  review process. The draft decisions adopt the reporting guidelines  and revised guidelines for technical review of greenhouse gas  inventories.

### IPCC TAR

The contact group convened in the evening to continue  consideration of the draft conclusions. On a paragraph noting that  the IPCC TAR provides information with long-term relevance in the  context of the UNFCCC's ultimate objective, MALAYSIA, for the G-77/CHINA, suggested deleting a sentence on the need to explore the  balance between mitigation and adaptation, while CHINA and SAUDI  ARABIA suggested removing the entire paragraph. CANADA, the EU,  NORWAY, JAPAN, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, and NEW ZEALAND highlighted the  importance of issues addressed in this paragraph, and favored  retaining it in some form. The US expressed concerns at a sentence  that invites submissions from Parties. The text was bracketed.

Following a short break to allow the Co-Chairs to revise the draft  conclusions to reflect Parties' comments, the contact group  reconvened later on Tuesday night to consider the updated text.  Participants then proceeded through the new text paragraph-by- paragraph, with negotiations continuing late into the night.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The corridors were eerily empty Tuesday evening as delegates met  behind closed doors to discuss SBSTA conclusions for the various  agenda items in time for translation deadlines Wednesday. While  work progressed steadily on technical details relating to the  revision of Annex I national inventories, some observers were  holding their breath in anticipation of additional controversy  over the Canadian proposal on LULUCF under the CDM, which  redefines the baseline year for reforestation. Discussions on this  item were brought to a quick finish Saturday night at the last  meeting of the contact group, but some said disagreements linger.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### SBI

SBI will convene at 10:00 am in Plenary I to address adoption  of the agenda, the Central Asia and the Caucasus, Albania and  Moldova (CACAM) request, and Croatia's proposal on LULUCF.

### CONTACT GROUPS

Contact groups are scheduled to meet on UNFCCC  Article 6 (education, training and public awareness), Article 4.8  and 4.9, P&Ms, Articles 5, 7 and 8, the IPCC TAR, and non-Annex I  national communications.
