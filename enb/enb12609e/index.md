# OPENING CEREMONY

COP 19/CMP 9 President Marcin Korolec highlighted several significant outcomes of COP 19 and lauded early engagement by Peru and France allowing 'the trio to make the road to Paris a smooth highway'. Minister of Environment of Peru Manuel Pulgar-Vidal was elected as the COP 20/CMP 10 President by acclamation. Pulgar-Vidal said COP 20 should increase trust, create space for dialogue between state and non-state actors, and lay ground work for a new climate agreement through a draft text balancing climate action and sustainable development. Stressing the key role of large cities in combating climate change, Susana Villarán de la Puente, Mayor of Lima, Peru, highlighted the commitment of mayors worldwide to push for a new mobility paradigm, change the energy matrix and invest in green infrastructure. Pointing to the lines and geoglyphs of Nazca, Peru, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Christiana Figueres encouraged delegates to draw inspiration from these ancient and indelible mythological symbols to 'carve crucial lines of action' towards, inter alia : drafting a new universal agreement; achieving progress on adaptation; and strengthening the financial capacity of the most vulnerable. Via recorded video message, President of Peru Ollanta Humala lamented that humanity has 'left behind the practice of sustainability' and said now is the time to return to the right path by taking action on climate change. Presenting the key findings of the Synthesis Report (SYR) of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Rajendra Pachauri, IPCC Chair, stressed that remaining below the 2 °C target will require that GHG emissions decline by 40-70% by 2050, relative to 2010 levels, and reach zero or negative levels by 2100.

Saudi Arabia, for the ARAB GROUP, noted the desire of developing countries to diversify their economies and emphasized developed countries' historical responsibility. Underscoring that the Kyoto Protocol continues to be the cornerstone of a rules-based climate change system based on common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) and respective capabilities, Pakistan, for the LMDCs, expressed concern over the slow pace of the Doha Amendment ratification. He called for revisiting developed countries' ambition and closing Annex I parties' ambition gap before June 2015. Panama, for COALITION FOR RAINFOREST NATIONS (CfRN), highlighted REDD+ as a fundamental element of the 2015 agreement and called for a REDD+ window in the GCF. Describing Lima as a decisive moment for the future of the multilateral regime on climate change, Chile, for AILAC, called for transparent, inclusive and productive negotiations, and urged countries to contribute to the GCF. Belize, for CENTRAL AMERICAN INTEGRATION SYSTEM (SICA), stressed the need for: acting decisively on adaptation and treating mitigation and adaptation equally; addressing loss and damage separately from adaptation; operationalizing the Warsaw Framework for REDD+; and providing clarity on the delivery by developed countries of US$100 billion per year by 2020.

WOMEN AND GENDER called for including women as a key part of real solutions. YOUTH NGOs (YOUNGOs) asked that leaders 'exceed our expectations', and build a healthy, safe and prosperous world with zero carbon emissions. Calling for climate action to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C, ENVIRONMENTAL NGOs (ENGOs) encouraged discussions to focus on pre-2020 ambition.

INDIGENOUS PEOPLES called for ensuring a human rights-based approach respecting indigenous peoples' rights in climate change agreements.

# CONTACT GROUPS

## SBSTA:

### Work Programme on the Revision of the Review Guidelines for Developed Country Parties:

This contact group, co-chaired by Riitta Pipatti (Finland) and Samuel Adeoye Adejuwon (Nigeria), met in the afternoon. Parties began paragraph-by-paragraph consideration of the text on UNFCCC Annex I inventory review guidelines prepared by the Secretariat.

###     Implications of the Implementation of Decisions 2/CMP.7 to 4/CMP.7 and 1/CMP.8

Co-Chair Anke Herold (Germany) provided an update on the November 2014 technical workshop. Parties addressed issues including tables of conservativeness factors for adjustment.

AUSTRALIA proposed simplifying the conservativeness factor system to a single factor applicable to all adjustments regardless of the source of emissions. NEW ZEALAND noted the large number of technical issues that must still be resolved to provide parties with certainty heading into the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.

###     Clarification of the Text in Section G (Article 3.7 ter ) of the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol

Co-Chair Herold introduced the contact group, which continued consideration of this issue from SBSTA 40, taking into account options for elements of a draft decision text (FCCC/SBSTA/2014/L.18), as well as an additional submission by Australia.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

As negotiations opened on Monday morning, delegates immediately found themselves in the hot seat as IPCC Rajendra Pachauri challenged delegates to 'come to terms' with the fact that staying below the 2 °C target requires zero or negative emissions, relative to 2010 levels, by 2100. The literal heat of the venue prompted one delegate to exclaim 'this is just like a greenhouse and this is exactly what's happening to our planet'. 'Last October, those of us who were at the Convention for Biological Diversity COP in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were subjected to cold temperature extremes; now we - re being tried by fire', complained another. Yet, while many took off their jackets following the COP President's exhortation, one observer lamented that 'the generic opening statements did not signal that delegates were ready to roll up their sleeves'. Some participants suggested that Lima's success will hinge on the 'long overdue fulfillment of promised leadership roles', with others pointing to 'positive signals' of emission reduction or limitation targets announced by the EU, the US and China, and the pledges of US$9.7 billion for the GCF. 'The heat is on', said a long-time observer, 'we - ll see if these signals will restore trust and facilitate progress toward an agreement in Paris over the next two weeks'.
