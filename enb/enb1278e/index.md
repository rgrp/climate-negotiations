# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Chair Bakary Kante (Senegal) opened the first meeting of the  SBI. Michael Zammit Cutajar, FCCC Executive Secretary, noted 37  countries have signed the Kyoto Protocol, including Parties  representing 39% of Annex I CO2 emissions.

The G-77/CHINA called on delegates not to be distracted from the  COP's principal task of implementing the Convention. He recalled  a Convention article on a second review of Annex I Party  commitments by December 1998. He also stressed decisions on new  and additional financial resources and inadequate implementation  of previous COP decisions on technology transfer.

On adoption of the agenda, SAUDI ARABIA proposed including  'preparatory work under the related provisions of Articles 2.3  and 3.14 of the Kyoto Protocol' in an item on technology  transfer. He said a decision at COP-3 on these paragraphs, on  adverse impacts, was taken as part of a compromise package. The  US expressed concern that the amendment could be prejudicial to  the Protocol's wording, because paragraph 2.3 states that the  COP serving as the Meeting of the Parties (MOP) 'may take  further action' and does not 'require' further action to promote  implementation of the paragraph's provisions. Delegates agreed  to amend the agenda item, adding a bracketed reference to  decision 3/CP.3 (adverse impacts) and Protocol Articles 2.3 and  3.14.

The Chair announced Iran's nomination as SBI Vice Chair for  Asia. He urged joint SBI-SBSTA draft decisions on work  allocation and preparations for a work program for the  Conference of the Parties/Meeting of the Parties (COP/MOP-1).

On national communications, delegates discussed three scheduling  options for future Annex I Party communications and their  review. Many Annex I Parties favored: lengthening the period  between submissions of national communications; interim  electronic reports; and synchronized reporting. Many favored  2001 for the next communication, but SWITZERLAND said  information on achievement of stabilization by 2000 could not be  provided until 2002. The US called for less emphasis on details  of domestic actions or national circumstances and for more time  for data collection on emissions trading and CDM projects. The  EU, with NEW ZEALAND, favored a fourth national communication  deadline of 2005 and a strengthened reporting process leading to  the period 2008-2012. CHINA, with the US, noted COP decisions  urging Annex II Parties to include measures taken for technology  transfer. The CHAIR invited Parties to submit nominations for a  roster of experts for the in-depth review of Annex I Parties'  second national communications.

# SUBSIDIARY BODY FOR SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL ADVICE

Chair Kok Kee Chow (Malaysia) said SBSTA's primary aim is to  identify common ground and delegates must make best use of the  scheduled time. The G-77/CHINA underscored the importance of the  Protocol's entry into force as soon as possible and cautioned  against distractions from this point. He expressed 'extreme'  disappointment at the low targets agreed in Kyoto. Supported by  SAUDI ARABIA, IRAN and VENEZUELA, he requested an additional  item on methodological issues related to Articles 4.8 and 4.9  (minimizing adverse impacts of response measures). Delegates  debated this proposal at length, and agreed to include an item  on 'referrals from SBI.' On cooperation with relevant international organizations, IPCC  Chair Dr. Robert Watson said the IPCC will produce technical  reports to assist the operationalization of the Protocol on:  emission scenarios, which will review the literature and  formulate a new set of scenarios; methodological and  technological issues in technology transfer; and one on aviation  and the global atmosphere, which assesses the relevant  atmospheric science, aviation technology and socio-economic  issues. The Third Assessment Report will place climate change in  a broader evolving social context.

Dr. Thomas Spence of the Global Climate Observatory Systems  (GCOS) said that a third draft of the work report covering the  status of current systems and recommendations, and fundamental  observations on short- and long-term variability, will soon be  available. He noted that systems currently in use are usually  not set up for climate purposes, resulting in some  inconsistencies in data collected.

Dr. Will Stephen of the International Geosphere and Biosphere  Programme (IGBP) said his organization's research provides a  broad scientific context against which to judge proposed actions  under the Protocol. He said that consideration should be given  to issues such as the saturation of carbon sinks when  negotiating.

# PLENARY

Maria Julia Alsogaray, Secretary of Natural Resources and  Sustainable Development of Argentina, characterized COP-3 in  Kyoto as a dynamic step toward meeting the FCCC's goals and said  COP-4 in Buenos Aires should be another step in the same  direction. She noted the great interest in the Clean Development  Mechanism (CDM) and emissions trading, but highlighted the need  to address the FCCC as a whole. She urged delegates to develop  the elements common to all flexibility mechanisms together.

UNEP Executive Director Klaus TÃ¶pfer pointed to the connection  between flexibility and minimizing repercussions for economic  growth potential. He underlined UNGASS's call for improved  scientific knowledge on the linkage between environmental  conventions, policy coherence and public awareness. He expressed  the hope that his task force could support conventions and work  on linkages with a view to making the best use of institutions  and capacity development.

FCCC Executive Director Michael Zammit Cutajar said he had  suggested that the Bureau consider inviting UNEP to offer help  on specific issues with linkages to other processes. He spoke of  an explosion of activities seeking to contribute to the design  of the three new mechanisms envisaged in the Protocol. The  Secretariat had just convened a meeting of expert and interested  organizations to contribute to discussion on the mechanisms, to  promote information exchange on plans and resources available  for implementation. The sooner Parties set the basic rules, the  sooner economic and institutional actors could adjust their  plans. He drew attention to the Secretariat's document raising  important questions for Parties regarding the new mechanisms and  sought further guidance from the Subsidiary Bodies on future  Secretariat activities relating to the new mechanisms.

MAURITANIA sought clarification regarding suggestions for a UNEP  role. The Executive Secretary responded that the suggestion was  to strengthen the role of UNEP's activities, which could not be  implemented without the approval of the Governing Council. The  PHILIPPINES noted that the activities of other intergovernmental  agencies increases confusion between AIJ and the Clean  Development Mechanism (CDM) and said the COP is the only body  mandated to undertake activities under the FCCC.

Regarding flexibility mechanisms, SBI Chair Kante recalled that  the CDM, emissions trading and joint implementation are new to  the agenda of the subsidiary bodies as a result of COP-3. This  joint meeting was designed to identify preparatory work needed  for COP-4 and reach agreement on a work schedule. Delegates  could also decide on future work to be undertaken on AIJ.

The Chair recommended that delegates address the flexibility  mechanisms jointly in their statements. While each has specific  characteristics, they are concerned with cooperation among  Parties. Key issues to address include identifying questions  that can be resolved by COP-4, and essential areas of work on  each mechanism, such as methodological issues.

The Secretariat introduced: Mechanisms for cooperative  implementation (FCCC/SB/1998/1); Submissions by  intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations  (FCCC/SB/1998/Misc.2); Submissions from Parties on preparatory  work needed for COP-4 (FCCC/SB/1998/Misc.1); and Update on  activities implemented jointly (FCCC/SBSTA/1998/Inf.3).

The G-77/CHINA said the joint cooperation mechanisms bring about  technical, political and other new uncertainties that must be  settled. He expressed alarm at interpretations of the CDM as a  cleaner production mechanism or a global carbon fund. He opposed  having any entity outside the FCCC operate the CDM. MAURITANIA  said that it may be helpful to address the mechanisms for  implementation of the Protocol separately to avoid blurring the  delegates' capacity and making the Secretariat's work difficult.

The EU stressed that Parties must start with domestic action and  said flexibility mechanisms, which must be cost effective and  verifiable, should not create loopholes that weaken the  commitments to be made at COP-4. On emissions trading, he said  the adoption and ratification of a compliance regime is a  prerequisite, as is careful consideration of risk-sharing  between buyers and sellers. He noted the need to agree on: what  contribution CDM can make to Annex I QELROs; the operational  entities of CDM; and the form and identity of the various  institutions established under Article 12. He emphasized that  this Article does not refer to removals by sinks and suggested  that CDM should not apply to sinks unless the COP/MOP decides  otherwise.

The US favored a simple set of rules for emissions trading and  specified, inter alia, that no formal trading should occur until  the Protocol enters into force. A Party should not be able to  sell once it has emitted its allowed amounts during any period,  i.e. 'deficit trading.' He opposed limiting the percentages that  can be sold. He stressed it was premature to limit the extent to  which CDM activities may account for emissions limitation and  cautioned against the chilling effect of administrative  restrictions. He said that projects begun under AIJ that lead to  legitimate emissions reductions should receive credits.

INDIA opposed any hierarchy or prioritization of work with  regard to the three collaborative mechanisms. Supported by SAUDI  ARABIA, he noted that whereas the AIJ pilot phase originated as  a cost effective mechanism for developed countries, the CDM's  origins are in sustainable development through development  cooperation and resource transfer. He opposed any appropriation  of environmental space on the basis of current occupation or  historical emissions. SAUDI ARABIA called for completion of the  AIJ pilot phase before evaluation of the processes, and for full  SBSTA elaboration of the technical aspects of the mechanisms  rather than rushed decision-making at COP-4. HUNGARY noted that  the soft commitments of 1992 will expire in 2000 and called for  elaboration of new commitments undertaken in Kyoto by COP-4. He  favored addressing the mechanisms separately, and undertaking  work on JI and CDM as well as AIJ, in order to investigate how  an emissions trading network can function.

On the uncertainties surrounding the new mechanisms, the  ALLIANCE OF SMALL ISLAND DEVELOPING STATES (AOSIS) called for a  non-compliance regime and noted their supplementary role. He  noted the importance AOSIS attaches to adaptation. JAPAN called  on SBI and SBSTA to elaborate the CDM and asked SBSTA and the  IPCC to define sinks and measurements. He proposed a SBSTA  contact group on technical measures.

The MARSHALL ISLANDS cautioned that some organizations may be  getting ahead of the intergovernmental process. CANADA said any  advisory role for UNEP would be at the behest of the FCCC  Parties and UNEP's Governing Council. He proposed a contact  group to look at emissions trading, including rules, guidelines  and modalities. He proposed separate groups to look at joint  implementation and the CDM, and sinks. NEW ZEALAND called for  early decisions on transparent emissions trading to harness  economic efficiency to the achievement of environmental goals,  backed by a firm compliance regime. He objected to a proposal  for ceilings on amounts traded. UGANDA called for an advisory  technical panel. ZIMBABWE did not anticipate a final resolution  of issues surrounding flexibility mechanisms at COP-4.
