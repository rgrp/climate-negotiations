# JOINT WORKING GROUP ON COMPLIANCE

Co-Chair Neroni Slade (Samoa) introduced a revised text based on  intersessional consultations following SB-13 Part 1. On the  inclusion of principles within the text, the G-77/CHINA, opposed  by the US and JAPAN, urged their retention, noting that a number  of the proposed principles are not set out in UNFCCC Article 3  (principles). On the plenary of the Compliance Committee, the G-77/CHINA, opposed by the US, EU, AUSTRALIA, RUSSIAN FEDERATION and  NEW ZEALAND, said it should have an allocation as well as a  preliminary examination function. She also proposed that the  plenary be co-chaired by the Chairs of the facilitation and  enforcement branches, as an alternative to having a bureau.

On the mandate of the facilitation branch, the EU, with the US,  AUSTRALIA and NEW ZEALAND, and opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, CHINA and  the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES, said cases should be dealt with on their  merits and not on the basis of the Party involved. On the mandate  of the enforcement branch, the G-77/CHINA stated the branch should  only deal with Annex I Parties. The EU, JAPAN and the US said the  references to 'Annex I Party' could be deleted since the articles  falling into the scope of that branch only applied to Annex I  Parties and since non-Annex I Parties were not submitted to host- country requirements under the CDM. SAUDI ARABIA and the UNITED  ARAB EMIRATES, opposed by SAMOA and JAPAN, said Article 3.14  (adverse effects) was enforceable. NEW ZEALAND suggested adding  that the branch would determine whether 'a Party is or is not  meeting any requirement under Articles 5.2 (adjustments), 7.1  (inventories) and 7.4 (guidelines for the submission of  information) relating to the issuance of assigned amount under  Article 3.3 (afforestation, reforestation and deforestation) and  3.4 (additional activities).' INDIA, SAMOA and BRAZIL expressed  concern at this new proposal.

On the procedures to be followed, the US, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES and  SAMOA opposed text allowing flexibility to the enforcement branch  in the application of the consequences for economies in  transition. On sources of information, the EU, US, CANADA and NEW  ZEALAND opposed a suggestion by SAUDI ARABIA to delete reference  to NGOs and IGOs.

Co-Chair Slade, opposed by SAUDI ARABIA, said he would hold  consultations with Parties on Wednesday.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### PROTOCOL ARTICLES 5, 7 & 8

Delegates convened to resume  consideration of guidelines under Protocol Articles 5, 7 and 8.  Following opposition by SAUDI ARABIA to holding 'informal  informal' consultations among Parties to develop new text,  delegates agreed that the Co-Chairs would present a new text  during the week, as far as possible without brackets and based on  discussions within the group and from informal consultations. The  group then agreed to proceed on the basis of the Co-Chairs'  further elaborated text. Because of the linkages with other  groups, Co-Chair Plume said some elements of the guidelines would  not be finalized at COP-6. She then presented a list of important  issues requiring resolution, to which delegates made several  additions.

On first order problems, GERMANY and the US, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested including reference to this issue in the draft  decision on Article 7 rather than in the guidelines under this  article. The US explained that annual reports include information  on both inventories and the assigned amount and, opposed by the G-77/CHINA, suggested that first-order problems only refer to the  former.

On '[initial] assigned amounts,' the US and JAPAN stressed that  the terminology was dependent on the outcome of the mechanisms  group. BRAZIL, supported by the G-77/CHINA, said the terminology  was rather related to Protocol Article 3.1 (assigned amount) and  stated that it will submit a written proposal clarifying the  terminology. On the timing for reporting and review, discussions  focused on the deadline for the submission of information under  Article 7 and highlighted the linkages with the mechanisms group.  The US, JAPAN, NEW ZEALAND and the EU supported 1 January 2007 as  this deadline, while SAMOA preferred the year 2005 so as to allow  a pre-first commitment period review and determination of  eligibility to participate in the mechanisms. The EU and NEW  ZEALAND said the possibility of this participation provided a  sufficient incentive for Parties to submit information earlier  than 1 January 2007.

On the annual or periodic reporting and review of Protocol Article  3.14 (adverse effects), Co-Chair Plume said the Co-Chairs would,  with the participation of Saudi Arabia, the US and EU, consult  with the Co-Chairs of the contact group on adverse effects and  explain the difficulties in completing the guidelines without the  latter group having finished its work.

On demonstrable progress, the EU expressed support for a strong  obligation for each Party to demonstrate, in its national  communication, progress in meeting its commitments by 2005. SAMOA  requested clarification on how to indicate demonstrable progress  by 2005 if the Protocol has not already entered into force by that  time.  The US said that it did not support a separate reporting  system for demonstrable progress beyond what is currently required  to be included in the national communications.

### LULUCF

Co-Chair Thorgeirsson introduced the new Chairs' text on  LULUCF, as developed based on Party input during SBSTA-13 Part I  and informal consultations held in October. He said smaller  informal groups would be invited to consult on specific issues, as  little time remained, and assured delegates that the process would  remain transparent. He said the main points to be resolved  included definitions, accounting and reporting rules, and  limitation of credits. Distinguishing between bottom-up  limitations of eligible activities and top-down limitations of  credits, he invited Parties to provide comments on the section of  the new text relating to limitation of credits (additions and  subtractions from Parties' assigned amounts), noting limitation of  credits could apply overall or in the form of a cap, threshold or  discounting. The US and CANADA presented a proposal for the phase- in of forest management under Article 3.4 (additional activities),  stressing that it contained incentives to implement additional  sequestration activities. Under this approach, a certain amount of  carbon would be credited, after which a discount would be applied.  After a second threshold, full crediting would again be permitted.

BOLIVIA, opposed by BRAZIL and PERU, called for simultaneous  forward movement on the issue of sinks in the CDM in the contact  groups on both LULUCF and the mechanisms. INDONESIA said  accounting rules for Annex I countries should be applicable also  within the CDM and called for incorporation of social and cultural  dimensions. TUVALU, on behalf of AOSIS, questioned the status of  the new text, noting that some submissions had not been  incorporated. COLOMBIA and BOLIVIA cautioned against a 'pick-and- choose' approach under Article 3.4, under which Annex I Parties  could account for additional activities that sequester carbon but  ignore additional sources.

PERU, BRAZIL and PAPUA NEW GUINEA stressed the need to preserve  the integrity of the Protocol and the importance of emissions  reductions in Annex I countries. The US, opposed by CHINA, AOSIS  and PERU, supported a decision on Article 3.3 and 3.4 as a package  at COP-6, arguing that this is critical for the success of the  Protocol. NEW ZEALAND noted the need for consistency with Decision  9/CP.4 (LULUCF), and stated that the distinction between Article  3.3 and 3.4 is becoming blurred.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

Co-Chair Mohamad Reza Salamat (Iran) opened the  contact group by introducing the draft proposal on the special  considerations for least developed countries (LDCs), which he said  could possibly replace the third section of the draft decision on  adverse effects being considered in this contact group. He noted  that the draft decision remains entirely bracketed after Part I of  SB-13.

On whether to have one decision on both UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9  and Protocol Article 3.14 (adverse effects), or two separate  decisions, Co-Chair Salamat reported that legal advisers to the UN  had indicated that two separate decisions would be appropriate,  since the UNFCCC and Protocol are two distinct legal instruments,  but that the decision on this issue ultimately rests with the  Parties. A decision on this matter was deferred until later in the  week.

SAUDI ARABIA said he would provide a new proposal for the preamble  to the draft decision at the next meeting, after consulting with  the G-77/China. On the first section of the draft text, the G-77/CHINA opposed text qualifying the assessment and evaluation of  action related to adaptation. The G-77/CHINA and some Annex I  Parties agreed to meet separately to seek consensus on this text.

POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&Ms): Delegates continued negotiations on  the text developed during SB-13 Part I. The EU bracketed reference  to the decision that the relevant task requested by the Buenos  Aires Plan of Action has been completed. HUNGARY announced the  establishment of a new negotiating group - the 'Central Group  Eleven,' comprising various Central and Eastern European countries  - and expressed a preference for the establishment of a  'consultative process.' Delegates then considered the EU's proposed text on the decision  to facilitate cooperation of Annex I and other interested Parties  to enhance the individual and combined effectiveness of P&Ms. The  G-77/CHINA requested reference to enhancing the effectiveness of  P&Ms under Protocol Article 2 (P&Ms) in its entirety, while  CANADA, the US, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA urged limiting reference to  Article 2.1(b) (Cooperation on P&Ms). Reference to the Article  remains bracketed. The US, CANADA, AUSTRALIA and JAPAN queried a  proposal by the G-77/CHINA and SAUDI ARABIA to bracket reference  to 'other interested Parties.' After discussion on alternative  wording, the reference was removed.

Chair Roméro asked delegates not to reopen discussions on  unbracketed text in subsequent discussions. The EU, US and JAPAN  supported this proposal, while SAUDI ARABIA and VENEZULA opposed  it.  SAUDI ARABIA rejected the Chair's proposal to establish a  Friends of the Chair group to develop compromise text, and  threatened to withdraw support for a similar proposal in the  contact group on mechanisms. The contact group will reconvene on  Wednesday.

### DEVELOPMENT & TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGIES

This contact group  considered the Co-Chairs' revised text on a framework to enhance  the implementation of UNFCCC Article 4.5 (development and transfer  of technologies). Following discussion on the text, delegates  heard a brief presentation by the Secretariat on a technology  transfer clearinghouse. The new Co-Chairs' text also contains  three additional appendices relating to: an international  clearinghouse; capacity-building activities on technology  transfer; and preliminary ideas for Terms of Reference for the  'international panel of experts on technology transfer' or the  'advisory group of experts on technology transfer.' On the overall approach, some participants questioned the meaning  of an integrated approach, whether to specify 'state of the art'  environmentally-sound technologies and the need to also focus on  development of technology. CHINA and GHANA underscored a sectoral  approach to technology transfer. On POLAND´s suggestion to reflect  the priorities of economies in transition in the text, BRAZIL said  this was not explicitly reflected in UNFCCC Article 4.5, which  refers to developing countries in particular.

On technology needs assessment, the EU supported referring to  existing activities and to reporting. TRINIDAD & TOBAGO preferred  a broader reference to environmentally-sound technology rather  than specifying mitigation and adaptation technologies. On the use  of experts, the EU said it would be difficult to charge experts  with defining country-driven approaches. The US said the experts  should work on guidelines for developing such approaches.

On funding for the assessment, CANADA and the US preferred not  specifying Annex II countries, stating that numerous sources of  funding may be involved. THAILAND and CHINA objected, noting that  Article 4.5 specifically refers to Annex II Parties and not other  institutions. NIGERIA said technology needs assessment should not  depend on the availability of funds.

Delegates then addressed issues relating to the clearinghouse  mechanism, including whether the clearinghouse should be virtual  and whether it should be a permanent institution. THAILAND noted  with concern that the Secretariat was being asked to undertake  numerous tasks, while BRAZIL asked whether the Secretariat had the  required resources.

The EU noted the role of the private sector in creating enabling  environments. THAILAND called for balance with public sector  initiated technology transfer, noting that the private sector  tends to be biased towards mitigation technologies.

On the implementation of enabling environments, the G-77/CHINA  said that the actions of developing countries depend on the  implementation of Annex I commitments. The US proposed text  encouraging developing countries to 'promote efficiently  functioning environmentally-sound technology markets through the  appropriate structuring of taxes and to promote the accumulation  of accurate, timely and reliable information on various elements  of their economies where projects may be undertaken under the  CDM.' BRAZIL, with CHINA and THAILAND, strongly objected to  reference to the CDM and the continued attempts to link technology  transfer under the UNFCCC to the Protocol. The contact group  adjourned into two smaller drafting groups.

### MECHANISMS

Chair Chow distributed a new two-page draft  negotiating text on the role of the Conference of the Parties  serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol, and on the  Executive Board for the CDM. He noted that the text was the  outcome of informal consultations with the Friends of the Chair  group. After briefly providing clarification on the text, he  suspended the meeting and proceeded to meet in a closed Friends of  the Chair group in order to make further progress on the  negotiating text.

### CAPACITY BUILDING IN COUNTRIES WITH ECONOMIES IN TRANSITION

Delegates cleared all of the legal and  most of the substantive issues contained in the draft decision as  well as the framework for capacity building in economies in  transition. The US and EU requested that text on the provision of  financial and technical support for the implementation of the  framework through the 'GEF within its mandate' be bracketed. Co- Chair Uosukainen said he would consult on a proposal by the EU to  include Protocol Article 10 (existing commitments) in the preamble  of the draft decision. In concluding the session, he expressed  satisfaction with the progress achieved and added that he would  consult with the Bureau on how the remaining issues should be  resolved.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

A number of observers noted a change in atmosphere on Tuesday, as  many negotiators seemed to respond to President Pronk's strong  message on the need for urgency. They suggested that efforts by  some Parties to prevent delegates from moving forward into  'informal informal' consultations could be considered unrealistic  and counterproductive.

Some participants have also been discussing the escalating problem  one observer referred to as the 'ping-pong' effect: the tendency  to stall on taking decisions on issues that have linkages to other  contact groups. The most obvious example has been the question of  sinks within the CDM, with the contact groups on the mechanisms  and LULUCF trying to coordinate their respective work, an effort  some suggest has been exploited by particular groups to slow talks  and 'shift responsibility.'

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY
