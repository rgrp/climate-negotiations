# SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Adoption of the Agenda: The US recalled  his proposal of Monday, 10 June for an additional item to be  included on the SBI agenda regarding transparency of the UNFCCC  process, noting that the modified proposal was now entitled  'effective participation in the UNFCCC process.' SBI Chair Estrada  said the Secretariat would prepare a document containing an  analysis of the situation in other bodies and a description of  possible solutions. He suggested postponing the discussion until  SB-17. The US and CANADA urged a preliminary exchange of views at  the current session. VENEZUELA, for the G-77/CHINA, said little  time remained for this discussion and preferred the Chair's  suggestion. Adoption of the agenda was postponed.

### CACAM REQUEST

ARMENIA, for the CACAM group of countries, said the  group was seeking clarification on the definition of the term  'developing countries,' and on their status in the context of  UNFCCC decisions, including those taken at COP-6. He said the  CACAM countries were proposing that all references to 'developing  countries' in these decisions should be changed to 'developing  countries and other Parties not included in Annex I.' The EU  stressed that none of the CACAM countries are included in Annex I,  and said they therefore belong in the group of non-Annex I  Parties. He supported consideration of this issue, and said care  should be taken when drafting conclusions, using the term 'Parties  not included in Annex I,' as employed in the UNFCCC text. CANADA  said no Parties should be excluded from representation in treaty  bodies. VENEZUELA, for the G-77/CHINA, said examination of the  term 'developing countries' was not necessary. Chair Estrada said  he would continue consultations and report on these at SB-17.

### OTHER MATTERS

Croatian Proposal on LULUCF: On the proposal by  Croatia to consider its forest management activities under  Protocol Article 3.4 (additional activities), Chair Estrada noted  that consultations on a related Croatian proposal on changing its  base-year emissions were being undertaken by SBSTA. He said it was  agreed that both issues would be resolved concurrently, and that  the proposals would be addressed at SB-17. The EU noted that the  discounted forest management value proposed by Croatia exceeds the  value provided by the FAO, and said the matter should be forwarded  to SBSTA for consideration once the question of the base-year  emissions has been resolved. CROATIA said it did not consider it  necessary for SBSTA to address this issue given that a technical  review had already been carried out, and agreed with Chair  Estrada's suggestion to take up both its issues simultaneously.

# CONTACT GROUPS

### ARTICLE 6

Co-Chair Jean-Pascal van Ypersele introduced revised  draft conclusions and a draft decision on an Article 6 work  programme. After extensive paragraph-by-paragraph discussion on  the conclusions, Parties agreed to forward them to SBSTA for  approval, and to defer discussion on the draft decision to SB-17.  The conclusions acknowledge the possible scope of a work  programme, take note of the need to consider reviewing the  guidelines for national communications from Annex I Parties as  they relate to Article 6 activities, and invite the SBI to  consider, at SB-17, the issue of financial and technical support  in the implementation of a work programme on Article 6.  Parties  could not agree on the need for a work programme that would take  into account the 'availability of financial resources' and/or  Article 4.7 (technology transfer), and reference to these items  was deleted.

### ADVERSE EFFECTS

On implementing UNFCCC Article 4.8 and 4.9,  Parties discussed Chair Daniela Stoytcheva's draft SBI  conclusions. ZIMBABWE, for the G-77/CHINA, said the conclusions  failed to make a clear reference to the COP-7 decision on adverse  effects (5/CP.7), and stressed the importance of reflecting views  of implementation progress on wider activities. She also opposed a  sub-paragraph that notes that in the absence of funding, the  proposed insurance and risk assessment workshops could be  scheduled after COP-8. IRAN emphasized the importance of future  modeling activities. CANADA urged Parties to consider the workshop  TORs. AUSTRALIA, CANADA, the EU and US said Parties should follow  SBI Chair Estrada's request for a decision on process, not on  substance.  Parties agreed to delete reference to financial  contributions, but were unable to reach consensus on the  importance of modeling activities, the scope of submission of  Parties' views, and future workshops and their TORs. Chair  Stoytcheva adjourned the meeting to hold informal consultations.

Delegates reconvened in the evening to consider new draft  conclusions. The G-77/CHINA maintained that the draft conclusions  failed to reflect the wider implementation of activities. NEW  ZEALAND, CANADA, the EU and US supported the revised conclusions,  arguing that they provided a balanced compromise. Following  further amendments, delegates agreed on the conclusions, which  note the provision achieved to date on implementation of the  Article and invite Parties to submit an oral update on the  modeling workshop. In addition, the conclusions invite Parties to  submit views on progress by 1 August 2002, and stress the  importance of the insurance and risk assessment workshops, the  outcomes of which will be considered at SB-17.

### POLICIES AND MEASURES (P&MS)

Co-Chair Suk-Hoon Woo introduced  draft revised conclusions, and Co-Chair Pierre Giroux explained  that the text incorporated all elements of the relevant COP-7  decision (13/CP.7). Parties then discussed the draft conclusions  paragraph-by-paragraph. On text agreeing on a meeting to  facilitate an exchange of views, the US agreed, 'in the spirit of  compromise,' to the EU's wish that this should take the form of  intersessional consultations rather than a side event.

Parties also agreed on compromise language on further steps,  retaining the reference to a 'frame' for defining these steps that  was supported by the EU and SAMOA, and deleting the notion of 'in- depth' information-sharing as an element of this frame, as  requested by the US.

On a paragraph inviting relevant international and  intergovernmental organizations to report on their activities to  SB-17, delegates compromised by accepting the EU's preference for  reference to the IPCC, while at the same time accommodating the G-77/CHINA's desire to refer to P&Ms 'in Annex I Parties' in another  part of the text.

At the conclusion of the meeting, the G-77/CHINA proposed an  additional paragraph outlining principles for addressing P&Ms. Co- Chair Giroux highlighted existing text that he believed addressed  this issue, and suggested placing the proposal in brackets pending  further internal G-77/CHINA consultations. Noting that agreement  had been reached on all issues except for this proposal, he  thanked the group for completing its work, and said updated draft  conclusions would be forwarded to the SBSTA.

### ARTICLES 5, 7, AND 8

Delegates agreed on a revised version of the  draft COP-8 decision on demonstrable progress under Protocol  Article 3.2. Another draft COP-8 decision was greed that included  a new version of the guidelines for the expedited procedure for  the review for the reinstatement of eligibility to use the  mechanisms.

The group considered the draft conclusions on Articles 5, 7 and 8,  which relate to work on: demonstrable progress; review of  reinstatement of mechanisms' eligibility; the pending parts of the  guidelines under Articles 7 and 8; methodologies for adjustments  under Article 5.2; treatment of confidential data; and training of  ERT members.

Regarding the pending parts of the Article 7 and 8 guidelines,  participants agreed that the draft text considered during the  current session would remain the basis for work at SBSTA-17, and  Parties would submit views by 1 August. The G-77/CHINA suggested  adding a new paragraph stating that SBSTA agrees to further  elaborate the pending parts of the guidelines following the result  of the process of developing definitions and modalities for  including LULUCF under the CDM. He stressed the need to link the  work on the guidelines with that on LULUCF under the CDM. The EU  noted that the guidelines are scheduled to be completed by COP-8,  while the work on LULUCF under the CDM continues up until COP-9.  CANADA, with NEW ZEALAND, JAPAN and AUSTRALIA, stressed that the  guidelines can be adjusted later through a COP or COP/MOP decision  and there is no need to add language in this regard. He proposed  alternative language, in which Parties 'take note of ongoing work'  on LULUCF under the CDM. The EU suggested adding consideration of  the implications of this work, 'if any,' on the work under  Articles 5, 7 and 8 at a later stage.

After protracted discussions, Parties arrived at a compromise  according to which SBSTA takes note of its continuing work on  LULUCF under the CDM and agrees that it may be necessary to  consider the implications, if any, of the decision scheduled to be  taken at COP-9 on this issue for the results of the work on the  pending parts of the guidelines.

### IPCC TAR

Co-Chair David Warrilow opened the contact group late  Wednesday evening, noting that prolonged informal consultations  had taken place earlier in the day. He introduced the latest  revision of the draft conclusions, noting agreement during  informal talks on a number of paragraphs. He also identified areas  where agreement had not been reached, including language for a  paragraph on the TAR synthesis report.

Parties then considered the text paragraph-by-paragraph. CANADA,  the SEYCHELLES and others expressed concern at further changes  that might dilute the text. Discussions continued late into the  night, with several Parties objecting to the process for moving  forward in negotiations, and disagreements remaining on a number  of paragraphs.

### NON-ANNEX I NATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS

In a closed meeting in the  early afternoon, the G-77/CHINA said it was unwilling to negotiate  on the current Chairs' text. Parties gave their views and agreed  to give the G-77/China time to coordinate its position. The  meeting was reconvened in the evening and delegates exchanged  opinions on the sections of the draft guidelines on national  circumstances and national greenhouse gas inventory information.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

The seemingly endless haggling over text on the IPCC TAR was the  talk of the corridors Wednesday night. Having spent much of the  last two days in heated discussions, negotiators identified  arguments over proposals to refer to the ultimate objective of the  Convention under Article 2 as a major sticking point. Apparently,  reference to this issue was opposed by certain Parties from both  North and South, while others saw its inclusion as important for  moving forward.

Meanwhile, some delegates expressed satisfaction at the positive  nature of talks in the P&Ms contact group, while participants in  the group on adverse effects saw some minor hiccups finally  resulting in agreement on the draft conclusions.

In other news, a South-South disagreement surfaced late on  Wednesday over adopting guidelines on non-Annex I national  communications, with one delegate expressing 'frustration and  boredom' with the ongoing polarization on the issue.
