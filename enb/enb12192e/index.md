# A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE UNFCCC AND THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Climate change is considered one of the most serious threats to  human health and well-being, the global economy, and the  sustainability of the world's environment. Mainstream scientists  agree that the Earth's climate is affected by the anthropogenic  emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide. Despite  some lingering uncertainties, a majority of scientists believe  that precautionary and prompt action is necessary.

The international political response to climate change took shape  with the development of the UNFCCC. Adopted in 1992, the UNFCCC  sets out a framework for action aimed at stabilizing atmospheric  concentrations of greenhouse gases to avoid 'dangerous  interference' with the climate system. The UNFCCC entered into  force on 21 March 1994. It now has 186 Parties.

### THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

In 1995, the first meeting of the Conference  of the Parties (COP-1) established the Ad Hoc Group on the Berlin  Mandate, whose task was to reach agreement on strengthening  efforts to combat climate change. Following intense negotiations  culminating at COP-3 in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, delegates  agreed to a Protocol to the UNFCCC that commits developed  countries and countries making the transition to a market economy  to achieve quantified emissions targets. These countries, known  under the UNFCCC as Annex I Parties, committed themselves to  reducing their overall emissions of six greenhouse gases by at  least 5% below 1990 levels over the period 2008 and 2012 (the  first commitment period), with specific targets varying from  country to country. The Protocol also established three mechanisms  to assist Annex I Parties in meeting their national targets cost- effectively - an emissions trading system, joint implementation  (JI) of emissions-reduction projects between Annex I Parties, and  a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to encourage projects in non- Annex I (developing country) Parties.

It was left for subsequent meetings to decide on most of the rules  and operational details that determine how these cuts in emissions  will be achieved and how countries' efforts will be measured and  assessed. Eighty-four countries have signed the Protocol. To enter  into force, the Protocol must be ratified by 55 Parties to the  UNFCCC, including Annex I Parties representing at least 55% of the  total carbon dioxide emissions for 1990. To date, 73 Parties have  ratified the Protocol, including 21 Annex I Parties, representing  a total of 35.4% of the emissions.

### THE BUENOS AIRES PLAN OF ACTION

At COP-4, which met in Buenos  Aires, Argentina, in November 1998, Parties set a schedule for  reaching agreement on the operational details of the Protocol and  for strengthening implementation of the UNFCCC itself. In a  decision known as the Buenos Aires Plan of Action (BAPA),  delegates agreed that the deadline for reaching agreement should  be COP-6. Critical Protocol-related issues needing resolution  included rules relating to the mechanisms, a regime for assessing  Parties' compliance, and accounting methods for national emissions  and emissions reductions. Rules on crediting countries for carbon  sinks were also to be addressed. Issues under the UNFCCC requiring  resolution included questions of capacity building, the  development and transfer of technology, and assistance to those  developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the  adverse effects of climate change or to actions taken by  industrialized countries to combat climate change.

Numerous formal and informal meetings and consultations were held  during 1999 and 2000 to help lay the foundations for an agreement  at COP-6. However, as COP-6 drew closer, political positions on  the key issues remained entrenched, with little indication of a  willingness to compromise.

### COP-6 PART I

COP-6 and the resumed thirteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies were held in The Hague, the  Netherlands, from 13-25 November 2000. During the second week of  negotiations, COP-6 President Jan Pronk, Minister of Housing,  Spatial Planning and Environment of the Netherlands, attempted to  facilitate progress on the many disputed political and technical  issues by convening high-level informal Plenary sessions. He  grouped the issues into the following four 'clusters' or 'boxes':(a) capacity building, technology transfer, adverse effects and  guidance to the financial mechanism; (b) mechanisms; (c) LULUCF;  and, (d) compliance, policies and measures (P&Ms), and accounting,  reporting and review under Protocol Articles 5 (methodological  issues), 7 (communication of information) and 8 (review of  information).

However, by Thursday, 23 November, negotiations remained stalled,  and President Pronk distributed a Note containing his proposal on  key issues in an attempt to encourage a breakthrough. After almost  36 hours of intense talks, negotiators could not achieve an  agreement, with financial issues, supplementarity in the use of  the mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF proving particularly  difficult. On Saturday afternoon, 25 November, President Pronk  announced that delegates had failed to reach agreement. Delegates  agreed to suspend COP-6, and expressed a willingness to resume  their work in 2001.

### PREPARATIONS FOR COP-6 PART II

A number of meetings and  consultations were convened after COP-6 Part I in an effort to get  negotiations back on track. In late June 2001, President Pronk  presented a consolidated negotiating text to help negotiators  reach a compromise. However, while some participants expressed the  opinion that positions did not appear to have shifted since COP-6  Part I, others suggested that positions had possibly widened on  issues such as LULUCF, sinks in the CDM, and funding.

In addition to official preparations for COP-6 Part II, there were  a number of political developments following the meeting in The  Hague. In March 2001, the US administration repudiated the  Protocol, stating that it considered the Protocol to be 'fatally  flawed,' as it would damage its economy and it exempts developing  countries from emissions targets.

### COP-6 PART II

COP-6 Part II and the fourteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies met in Bonn, Germany, from 16-27 July  2001. From 16-18 July, delegates met in closed negotiating groups  to settle differences on key texts. On 19 July, the high-level  segment began, with participants striving to achieve a 'political'  decision on key outstanding issues. After protracted  consultations, President Pronk presented his proposal for a draft  political decision outlining agreement on core elements of the  BAPA. However, in spite of several Parties announcing that they  could support the political decision, disagreements surfaced over  the section on compliance. After several further days of  consultations, ministers finally agreed to adopt the original  political decision, with a revised section on compliance. The  political decision - or 'Bonn Agreements' - was formally adopted  by the COP on 25 July.

Although draft decisions were approved on several key issues,  delegates were unable to remove all brackets in text on the  mechanisms, compliance and LULUCF. Since not all texts in the  'package' of decisions were completed, all draft decisions were  forwarded to COP-7.

### COP-7

Delegates met for COP-7 and the fifteenth sessions of the  UNFCCC's subsidiary bodies in Marrakesh, Morocco, from 29 October  - 10 November 2001. The main goal was to complete tasks left  unfinished at COP-6 Parts I and II, thereby bringing to a close  three years of negotiations. The Bonn Agreements served as the  basis for delegates striving to finish their work.

From 30 October to 6 November delegates met in negotiating groups,  closed drafting groups and informal consultations in an attempt to  resolve outstanding issues relating to the mechanisms, compliance,  accounting, reporting and review under Articles 5, 7and 8, and  LULUCF. Ongoing negotiations were also held on draft COP decisions  relating to LDCs, the Consultative Group of Experts on non-Annex I  National Communications (CGE), and input to the WSSD.

On Wednesday, 7 November, COP-7's high-level segment began, with  ministers and senior officials seeking to bring negotiations to a  successful conclusion. After protracted bilateral and multilateral  talks, a package deal on LULUCF, mechanisms, Protocol Articles 5,  7 and 8, and input to the WSSD was proposed on Thursday evening, 8  November. Although the deal was accepted by most regional groups,  including the G-77/China and the EU, the Umbrella Group (a loose  alliance of Annex I Parties that includes Canada, Australia,  Japan, the Russian Federation, and New Zealand) did not join the  consensus, with key areas of dispute including eligibility  requirements and bankability under the mechanisms. However,  following extensive negotiations, a package deal was agreed, with  key features including consideration of LULUCF Principles and  limited banking of units generated by sinks under the CDM.

# INTERSESSIONAL HIGHLIGHTS

### PREPARATIONS FOR SB-16

A series of workshops that have taken  place since COP-7 will provide participants with input for  discussions at SB-16. In April, workshops were held on:  methodologies for technology needs assessments; technology  information; the revision of the guidelines for non-Annex I  national communications; the CGE; the terms of reference and an  agenda for work related to definitions and modalities for  including afforestation and reforestation activities under Article  12 in the first commitment period; the IPCC TAR; and the  elaboration of draft technical guidance on methodologies for  adjustments under Protocol Article 5.2 (adjustments). In May,  workshops were held on the status of models designed to assess the  adverse effects of climate change and impacts of response  measures, and on cleaner or less greenhouse gas-emitting energy.  Two additional workshops on developing a work programme on  activities related to UNFCCC Article 6 (education, training and  public awareness), and on the draft revised uniform reporting  format for activities implemented jointly, were held immediately  prior to SB-16, along with consultations on registries.

### RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Since COP-7, 33 additional Parties have  ratified the Protocol. This includes Japan, and the fifteen member  States of the European Union, which delivered their instruments of  ratification to the UN on 31 May. Several other Parties have also  begun the process of ratification and are expected to complete  this procedure by the start of the WSSD in August.

On 17 January, Joke Waller-Hunter (the Netherlands) was named the  new Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC. SB-16 marks her first major  UNFCCC meeting in this role. During the Nineteenth Session of the  IPCC held in April, Rajendra K. Pachauri (India) was named the new  Chair of the IPCC.

# THINGS TO LOOK FOR TODAY

### SBSTA

SB-16 is expected to begin at 10:00 am with an opening  session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological  Advice (note that the Subsidiary Body for Implementation does not  meet until 10 June). In the morning, SBSTA is scheduled to  consider organizational matters, the TAR, and various  methodological issues. In the afternoon, it is likely to discuss  technology transfer, the relationship between efforts to protect  the ozone layer and the climate system, and policies and measures.

### INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

Informal consultations are likely late in  the afternoon. Please check the television monitors for further  details.
