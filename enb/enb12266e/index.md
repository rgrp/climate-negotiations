# SBSTA

### MITIGATION WORKSHOP

Kok Seng Yap (Malaysia) and Toshiyuki  Sakamoto (Japan) facilitated this in-session SBSTA workshop, which  focused on factors that affect technology innovation, deployment  and diffusion, and socioeconomic aspects of mitigation, including  poverty reduction and economic impacts.

Richard Bradley, International Energy Agency, noted that  stabilizing emissions while addressing electricity deprivation  will require a change in capital structures and the deployment of  all available energy technologies. He highlighted 'greening  investment' and cooperative R&D agreements.

Christian Azar, Chalmers University, highlighted the importance of  efficiency standards, particularly when energy prices are low. He  noted that a 1936 car had a fuel efficiency of six liters/100km,  which is comparable to today's performance, and underscored  underinvestment in public energy R&D and the need for public  investment in market deployment.

Priyantha Wijayatunga, Public Utilities Commission, Sri Lanka,  elaborated on mitigation technology barriers in developing  countries. He questioned whether developing countries should use  technologies that are not deployed in developed countries, such as  the Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle, and questioned the  adequacy of the CDM as a financing mechanism.

Mitsutsune Yamaguchi, Teikyo University, reported on efficiency  gains in Japan's iron and steel sector, adding that if this sector  in China and Russia achieved the same energy intensity, total  global emissions would fall one percent. He supported diffusion of  Coke Dry Quenching (CDQ) technology.

Lu√≠s Cifuentes, Catholic University of Chile, presented on the US  EPA's Integrated Environment Strategies (IES) Programme, which  aims to identify integrated strategies and measures that address  greenhouse gas abatement and local air pollution. He noted mostly  positive correlations between greenhouse gas and local air  pollutant reductions, and said health benefits of abatement  usually outweigh the costs.

David Montgomery, Charles River Associates, focused on the  spillover effects of mitigation measures in Annex B countries.  Montgomery explained that patterns of spillover are determined by  which fuels and sectors the policies target. SAUDI ARABIA said  energy taxation should be restructured to reflect carbon content.

Steve Thorne, SouthSouthNorth Project, presented on lessons  learned from mitigation projects in South Africa, noting a 'race  to the bottom' when it comes to the sustainable development  requirement of CDM projects. He warned that unless sustainable  development is accorded a value, it will remain an incidental  benefit.

### ADAPTATION

On Monday afternoon, SBSTA reconvened to address its  agenda item on the scientific, technical and socioeconomic aspects  of adaptation, and Chair Abdulla presented his summary of the  workshop. The EU stressed SBSTA's role in synthesizing and  disseminating existing information, and identified adaptation as  complementary to mitigation.

The G-77/CHINA called for a more action-oriented objective, and  for taking a portfolio of approaches instead of a purely sectoral  approach. He said the need to expedite measures should not be  restricted by calls for further assessments. The US highlighted  the need to focus on priority sectors and to link measures to  long-term planning.

Tuvalu, for AOSIS, called for a special track for SIDS to address  urgent needs, and said the programme should not include matters  relating to mitigation. SWITZERLAND stressed SBSTA's role in  identifying available methodologies. JAPAN noted that a thematic  approach would be preferable to a time-consuming sectoral  approach. Sudan, on behalf of the AFRICA GROUP, cautioned that a  sectoral approach may marginalize local knowledge and called for a  thematic and livelihoods approach. Marjorie Pyoos (South Africa)  and James Shevlin (Australia) will convene consultations.

### MITIGATION

Delegates took up scientific, technical and  socioeconomic aspects of mitigation. Kok Seng Yap and Toshiyuki  Sakamoto reported on the workshop held that morning. Many  delegates highlighted the CDM, energy efficiency, barriers to  technology transfer and deployment, and renewable energy sources.

JAPAN proposed benchmarking efficiency levels on a sectoral basis  and institutional reform of the CDM. NORWAY stressed challenges in  the transport sector and, with the EU, highlighted the co-benefits  of mitigation measures. The EU said it would support elaborating a  multi-year work programme. CANADA referenced carbon capture and  storage and the upcoming IPCC report on this matter. The US  highlighted capacity building and cooperation between governments  and the private sector. KENYA said renewable energy technology  should be manufactured locally. AUSTRALIA noted initiatives  supporting international cooperation, including the Carbon  Sequestration Leadership Forum and Renewable Energy and Energy  Efficiency Partnership (REEEP). Informal consultations to develop  SBSTA draft conclusions will begin Tuesday at 3:00 pm.

# SBI

### ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

Following further debate on Saudi Arabia's  proposal to add agenda items on implementation of UNFCCC Article  4.8 and 4.9 (FCCC/SBI/2005/1/Add.2), Chair Becker proposed that  those items and a G-77/China proposed item on capacity building be  included under Other Matters. Following informal consultations,  delegates accepted the Chair's proposal and adopted the agenda  (FCCC/SBI/2005/1 and Add.1).

### OTHER MATTERS

Following a statement by Tanzania, for the  G-77/CHINA, referencing decisions 2/CP.7 and 2/CP.10 on capacity  building, the Chair noted the importance of commitments to review  the capacity building framework and receive a report from GEF at  the next session. He will draft SBI draft conclusions.

SAUDI ARABIA read a statement regarding the commitments in, and  importance of, decisions 5/CP.7 and 1/CP.10. The Chair invited  parties to provide comments prior to drafting SBI conclusions. He  also agreed to annex Saudi Arabia's statement.

# CONTACT GROUPS AND INFORMAL CONSULTATIONS

### REVIEW OF THE SECRETARIAT'S ACTIVITIES

The contact group on the  internal review of Secretariat activities reconvened on Monday  morning. On the draft COP conclusions, Chair Dovland added a  paragraph inviting the Secretariat to keep Parties informed about  its follow up to the review. The EU, supported by the US, amended  a paragraph on work with other international organizations,  specifying that cooperation and communication should be focused  and add value. JAPAN and SWITZERLAND added that efforts should be  conducted within available resources. On documentation, the EU  introduced text on the advantage of Parties exercising discipline  when asking the Secretariat to prepare papers. The contact group  has scheduled a final meeting for Tuesday afternoon at 4:30 pm.

### PROGRAMME BUDGET FOR THE BIENNIUM 2006-2007

Delegates discussed  new draft proposals from the Chair and the Secretariat's proposed  budget. Nigeria, for the G-77/CHINA, noted that the frequency of  expert group meetings supported by core funding must be consistent  with COP decision 4/CP.7. The EU, CANADA, SOUTH AFRICA and others,  opposed by the RUSSIAN FEDERATION, supported the proposed budget,  given increased requirements due to the Kyoto Protocol's entry  into force. The US stressed its concerns over the division of  Kyoto Protocol and Convention expenses, rather than the size of  the budget. The Chair will consult informally and present revised  proposals at the group's final meeting on Tuesday.

### LEAST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

Delegates considered draft SBI  conclusions and a draft COP 11 decision on LDCs. Co-Chair Moita  asked that parties consider these texts as a compromise way  forward. Many parties, including the EU, NORWAY, CANADA, JAPAN and  Bangladesh, on behalf of the LDC GROUP, said they saw many  positive aspects in the proposed texts. Several said they could  still not agree to the text without revisions. At the request of  the Co-Chairs, parties agreed to consult informally. The contact  group will reconvene Tuesday.

### REGISTRY SYSTEMS UNDER THE KYOTO PROTOCOL

Murray Ward (New  Zealand) chaired informal consultations on Monday, with delegates  considering short draft conclusions. Discussions focused on the  process and the timing of the indicative schedule for developing  the international transaction log (ITL). A longer revised draft  text was circulated on Monday evening.

### RESEARCH NEEDS RELATING TO THE CONVENTION

Consultations resumed  on Monday, with delegates working on draft conclusions. Steady  progress was reported, with text added on technology transfer.  Informal consultations will continue on Tuesday.

### ARRANGEMENTS FOR INTERGOVERNMENTAL MEETINGS

This contact group  reconvened on Monday afternoon. Saudi Arabia, for the G-77/CHINA,  added a request that the host country facilitate the issuance of  visas for COP 11 and the COP/MOP 1. He proposed deleting a request  that the COP 10 Bureau, with the Secretariat and COP 11 President- designate, further consider the details and format of high-level  segments; and proposed the addition of an invitation to the  Parties to enhance contributions to allow effective participation.  NORWAY and the EU opposed the deletion. The G-77/CHINA queried a  budget allocation of US$140,000 (FCCC/SBI/2005/Add.2) for pre-COP  high-level intergovernmental consultations. The Secretariat  explained that this was a possible requirement from the  supplementary fund. On draft proposals for the high-level  segments, the US supported including a panel or roundtable.  Parties will consult informally and the contact group will  reconvene Tuesday afternoon.

### NON-ANNEX I COMMUNICATIONS

Co-Chairs Sok Appadu and Turesson  facilitated informal consultations on timing of submissions of  second and, where appropriate, third national communications.  Intervals of four or five years are under consideration. Parties  have been considering proposals from the G-77/China, and will  reconvene at 11:00 am Tuesday morning.

### ADAPTATION

Co-Chair Shevlin proposed initiating an exchange of  views based on the SBSTA Chair's summary of the workshop. On  objectives of the work programme, the G-77/CHINA, with AOSIS,  called for action-oriented, short- and long-term measures, and a  focus on the most vulnerable. The EU, US, and NEW ZEALAND favored  improved understanding and cooperation. On the structure of the  work programme, the EU, US, and CANADA proposed taking a sectoral  approach, while the G-77/CHINA, AOSIS, RUSSIAN FEDERATION, AFRICA  GROUP and JAPAN preferred a broader approach, including a  livelihoods approach. Regarding modalities, the G-77/CHINA and  AOSIS called for a working group to advance work and ensure  follow-up. Discussions will continue in the contact group on  Tuesday afternoon.

### ADJUSTMENTS FOR LULUCF

During an evening meeting of the contact  group, Co-Chair Paciornik presented revised draft text. Delegates  agreed to request submissions on criteria for failure to submit  information, and concluded their work late Monday with agreement  on all outstanding issues.

### EMISSIONS FROM AVIATION AND MARITIME TRANSPORT

Informal  discussions extended until 10:00 pm, with strong disagreements  persisting and draft text remaining bracketed. Informal  discussions will continue Tuesday.

# IN THE CORRIDORS

A number of participants at SB 22 have commented on an apparent  shift in China's engagement in the climate change process. While  some observers believe the Group of 77 is occupying familiar  ground, they argue that China's role has increased in line with  its emerging status as a major economic power-and that its  positions on some issues may be shifting, too. Some see the  environmental fallout from China's rapid industrialization as a  key driver of that country's approach. The view is that China  anticipates trouble ahead and has decided to help shape the  architecture of the climate regime so as to minimize shocks  further down the road. According to some experts, another driver  could be China's engagement with the WTO regime. Observers have  also noted closer collaboration between China and Japan, as the  two countries eye-up opportunities for drawing down mutually  beneficial environmental and economic rewards from the climate  regime.
