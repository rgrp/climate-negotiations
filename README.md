Information on 20 years of the UN Climate Change negotiations from the [Earth
Negotiations Bulletin][enb] of the IISD. The [Earth Negotiations Bulletin
(ENB)][enb] produced by the IISD provides the richest and most neutral
reporting system on the United Nations negotiations on the environment. The
[ENB volume 12][vol12], in particular, have been covering for more than 20
years the discussions of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC).

*Who wants to use this information and to do what?*

A. I am a negotiator from the Bangladesh delegation. I am attending a meeting
of the SBI (subsidiary body for implementation) and I am trying to get passed a
more stringent rule for the accounting of greenhouse gases emission, but I am
encountering a staunch opposition from the delegate of Saudi Arabia. I’d like
to see what this country has said on the same matter in the previous
discussions in the SBI.

B. I am a journalist and I have just seen the delegation of the AOSIS group
(Alliance of Small Islands) leaving the room because of a disagreement over
Loss and Damage. I’d like to know more about this topic and see which other
positions have been taken earlier by the same delegations.

## The Problem

The ENB is a great tool for following day-by-day the evolution of the
negotiations, but it does not easily allow to retrieve all the interventions by
one actor and/or about one topic and/or in a specific negotiation table. This
difficulty comes from two main shortcomings of the ENB:

* Spurious aggregation. Covering the negotiations in a strict chronological
  organisation - event-by-event and day-by-day - each ENB report aggregates in
  the same document:

  * different negotiation tracks (if they took place in parallel during the
    same day);
  * and different reporting formats (history of the previous meetings,
    analysis, official negotiations, in the corridors...).

* Inconsistent structuration. Though each reports is divided into ‘sections’
  separated by titles and referring to different negotiation tracks and
  reporting formats, such structure is difficult exploit because:

  * title and sections are nested in complex way;
  * the headings wording, formatting and nesting is not consistent through the
    different bulletins.
